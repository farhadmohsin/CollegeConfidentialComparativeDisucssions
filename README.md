# CollegeConfidentialComparativeDisucssions

* text/ contains all the discussions in an unstructured format.
* json/entities contains the pre-defined entities for each discussion
* json/comments contain the discussion in a json format
* TODO: combined/ contains separate directory for each annotated discussion. But the file is incomplete, with the "comment" column empty. Need to fix this
* all_annotations.csv has all annotations from all annotators. i.e., each pair of alternative will have multiple annotations (from different annotators) for each comment
* aggregate_labels.csv has one annotation for each pair of alternative in each comment (the majority annotation)
