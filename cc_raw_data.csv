"Congrats on some great choices. You are unlikely to have your questions answered until you visit and see each of the schools/programs in action. We had one accepted to Cal Tech but chose elsewhere after visiting. The environment was much too small for what he was looking for, but others may prefer that. When we took the engineering tour at different schools there was a clear winner for him. You are wise to consider that he may change his engineering focus when he gets there, so it is good to be happy with the engineering program/school overall. They are very different schools and if you are able to visit, that will make a big difference and provide ease in your decision process.

"I agree with blueskies2day - visit all of the schools before making a decision.
However, the harsh reality in today’s job market (ok, in any generation’s job market), prestige matters.
JHU and CalTech are ranked up there with the Ivies and certain corporations will only hire from what they consider “elite” universities.  In addition, let’s say your son doesn’t want to do BME after exploring that field.  Google, Goldman, Mckinsey would be happy to talk to him if he goes to JHU or CalTech.  It would be possible from G-Tech, but harder for sure.  Call these firms snobs if you want, but it’s their money.

The reality is, companies MAY have pet schools, and they frequently, for engineering at least, are not the usual suspects. Grades and internships/coops also matter. A marginal Caltech student will not have the opportunities that a student with a high GPA and good work or research experience from San Diego State will have. The name will not buy success.

"Do not confuse Biomedical Engineering with the related, but different Caltech majors.  Dig into the majors and the career/grad school directions.
By reputation, JHU just about invented the BME field.  Consider asking more “what if” questions about the major content, flexibility and the range of  your own interests.

"As fields mature they produce offspring, but not all siblings are the same.
As new fields develop, they split off from the more established departments. Physics gave birth to EE, and EE had to fight for it.  ME is responsible for a lot of the development in BM, but so are ChE, EE and the life sciences. As these field continue to develop, the interdisciplinary nature of BME becomes more complex and apparent. Sometimes the parents don’t like to see the children leave home. They don’t like the loss of control of their offspring and they don’t like the competition for resources within the institution. This result is the fruit of academic politics, but programs do differ. This is another step in the ongoing evolution of engineering/science.
Learn about the siblings.  I believe JHU covers the interdisciplinary range of BME.  I am not sure here, but I believe GT is more into the robotics side of BME.  Check with GT.

I know some extremely intelligent students in the Top 1% score ranges for testing and ranking in their classes that didn’t make it in. I thought GT was a match for me (34, Top 3% class, 3.9 UW) until I got deferred EA as well as some of my very qualified classmates. It’s brutal even in-state, and I would consider it a reach for pretty much all in-state students unless you’re a Val or Sal at one of the approved schools.

"I have a son at GaTech, junior if anyone has questions on that school.  Familiar with Baltimore and Atlanta and both
student bodies
GaTech by state law accepts over 50% Georgia students.  All valedictorians in Georgia get automatically accepted at GaTech IF their high school meets some criteria set by the Georgia Legislature.
GaTech is more fun loving student body, and less intense workload  than JHU.   Gatech has an excellent collaboration with Emory and a shuttle bus for BME students who want to work with medical doctors.
I would choose GaTech over JHU for the social aspects of undergraduate education.
Remember a BME undergrad  is going to either get a PhD or go to medical school, so getting plenty more education at least four more years of med school or six more years of research and classes for a PhD.
The rank difference is not that big between JHU and GaTech.  GaTech is arguably better for the design aspects of BME, the mechanical engineering side of BME.
Systems biology, maybe a bit better at JHU, if you are looking for research work.  GaTech is particularly good at imaging sciences, tissue research, see their materials science and chemical engineering department, and of course anything related to design is superb at GaTech.
Engineering overall is better at GaTech compared to JHU if thats your bent as well.
Caltech is in a class by itself, with mathematics thats way more advanced, so a student needs to have mastered Calculus 3, and even part of differential equations to be able to earn Bs at Caltech in freshman math.  It starts with Analysis.  Caltech freshman have typically passed a college level physics class and that is assumed knowledge to start beginning required physics at Caltech, required for every major there.
GaTech, if you score a 7/7 on IB Physics, you can place out of freshman physics, if you want to and take a more advanced physics class, or repeat as you see fit.  Physics is not the hardest class you will take at GaTech,probably, if you are taking freshman physics.
JHU and GaTech are not as challenging (ball busting???)  as Caltech in physics and mathematics.

She ultimately ended up choosing University of Maryland since they had given her a full ride and she knew she wanted to continue her studies in grad school when she finished undergrad and didn’t want a huge amount of debt.  Each of the 3 programs are very strong and each campus has their strengths. Your son should try to choose where he feels will be the best fit for him not only academically but socially too.

This does not mean they will all be good engineers. In fact, when my son was looking, one of my patients (the manager of one of NASA’s most famous programs, dual PhD in Physics and Math, and Caltech prof) told me that some of the Caltech engineers he hired for that program were pretty pedestrian and that some of his best engineers were from Podunk U. Just because they teach brutally fast does not mean they are good at teaching students the art of solving practical engineering problems. Two retired Caltech profs told him that if his goal was to be a practicing engineer, not to consider Caltech.
Looking at JPLs Executive Council members with tech rolls (non-HR, etc.), none were educated at Caltech. Their schools in no particular order, representing both undergrad and graduate degrees are: Texas A&M, Sam Houston State, Cal Poly, Cal Poly Pomona, UCLA, Texas, MIT, Colorado, Washington, Toronto, USC and Purdue.
Engineering is VERY egalitarian. There are no magic schools where everyone is guaranteed success.

"“Caltech is Caltech. Cannot touch it. But remember its only 600 undergrads. Those kiddos almost all get PhDs.
Caltech is a school of geniuses and a few drop outs and a few that commit suicide as they cannot keep up.”
This does not mean they will all be good engineers. In fact, when my son was looking, one of my patients (the manager of one of NASA’s most famous programs, dual PhD in Physics and Math, and Caltech prof) told me that some of the Caltech engineers he hired for that program were pretty pedestrian and that some of his best engineers were from Podunk U. Just because they teach brutally fast does not mean they are good at teaching students the art of solving practical engineering problems. Two retired Caltech profs told him that if his goal was to be a practicing engineer, not to consider Caltech.

"I guess I do think that some branches of engineering do require more math than others, such as fluid mechanics. So it really depends on exactly what type of engineer you want to become, as to whether Caltech is a good fit.  Caltech is more of a chemistry, math and physics focused school, but the math will prepare students for a career in fluid mechanics for instance.  Thats the science that describes how an airplane moves through the air , the air being a “fluid”.
For an undergrad in BME, the chemistry at Caltech, might be compelling, but I would say JHU, Caltech or GaTech are about the same for BME.   Maybe GaTech a tad better, IF the student wants to design prosthesis, the best artificial heart, etc, because GaTech has such a tight relationship with Emory U Medical and has arguably very good mechanical engineering training.
All BMEs are going to get more education. So its also a personal preference, does the student  want hot dry Pasadena, a small town, with great access to Los Angeles, or the big bustling city of Atlanta, with sports, hiking, rock climbing close by, or the sailing and crab cakes  that Baltimore offers, with access to Washington DC?

"@Coloradomama, my son is in his final quarter of his MS in ME at Cal Poly. His thesis is in boundary layer fluid mechanics. He took more math as an undergrad at Cal Poly than is required in a the aerospace focus of ME at Caltech. Their main distinguishing factor is not level, but pace. They go at a speed higher than any other institution probably in the world. It is debatable though whether or not that produces a better undergraduate product. As I said, engineering is very egalitarian. Much like music, you have the chops or you don’t. How you get than can be extremely variable.

All you have to do is to look at the CEOs of top engineering firms to know that your thesis is patently false. Boeing’s current CEO, Dennis Muilenberg went to undergrad at Iowa State.

Satya Nadella…Microsoft…first US degree, MS from Wisconsin-Milwaukee. I could go on and on.
Sure, you can find some, Jeff Bezos for example, that did go to a “top” institution, Princeton. Of the top 20 Fortune 500 CEOs though, he’s the only one that hails from the Ivy League. If your story were true all the top spots would be held by grads of “top” schools. They demonstrably are not.

[/quote]

On the topic of student demographics, it’s perhaps worth noting that they differ in gender ratios in addition to geographic diversity. That matters to some and doesn’t bother others in the slightest, particularly when the schools of interest vary so greatly in size. YMMV.
Georgia Tech: 61.2% men, 38.8% women
Caltech: 54.6% men, 45.4% women
Johns Hopkins: 49% men, 51% women
The schools also differ markedly in class sizes. Unsurprisingly, Georgia Tech has more than a few large classes – a whopping 26% of its classes have more than 50 students, compared to 10% at JHU and Caltech.
Caltech and JHU report that 67% and 74% of their classes have fewer than 20 students, respectively; at Georgia Tech, 39% of classes have fewer than 20 students.
Of course, it is always best to check the enrollments in the departments of interest. It does a BME student no good if all of the small classes at his/her university are in departments like German and music.

He did not have a string of significant publications but always had yet another way of explaining a concept,  Another math faculty educated at Bowdion gave up a few hours on a Sunday afternoon to go over questions I had collected.  Perhaps these small LA colleges have a point!
How do you account for these “cooks” when selecting an  undergraduate institution?  This is not reflected in the USNEWS rankings as they are based largely on graduate school research.

"@scubadive  the college board posts results for 2018.  5100 or so out of 2.3mm test takers earned at 1560 or better last year.
That score translates to a 35 act.  The middle of your 34 to 36 example. If you add in the 34s maybe another 30k. I’ve checked before but it’s not the exact number that matters. Top ten percent of any group is good company. Top five percent even better.  Top two percent. That’s pretty close to rare.
That isn’t one in a million but pretty darn exceptional. There aren’t really “scores” of students in the 34 to 36 cohort as many suggest.

Do you have any statistics to say Georgia Tech students get recruited “by far” more than JHU students at the elite Investment Banks, tech companies, and management consulting companies?  I’m ex bain from JHU, and can tell you point blank all three “elite” consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) hire more than their fair share of JHU students.  I’d also see what division of Goldman is hiring.  Hackathon usually constitutes their IT divisions - far from elite like their IB division which hires substantially from JHU (i’m happy to name JHU alumni that are in Goldman’s IB group from recent classes).
Lastly in tech, Google and Facebook and other elite firms also hire substantially from JHU.   I work for one of the former now.  It’s unclear proportionally that they hire more from from Georgia Tech - I certainly don’t see it at HQ.
I’d choose JHU, bias and all.  When I graduated, I had my pick of grad schools with a full ride for Ph.D programs and my choice of jobs at graduation as well.  Ended up getting a Master’s for free from MIT, but had McKinsey, Bain, and Google offers at graduation as well.  When I was choosing schools for undergrad, I was also offered a scholarship at Georgia Tech (Stamps) along with UMD (Banneker-Key) and UVa (Jefferson), but ended up paying a bit more at JHU and don’t regret it in the least.

Bottom line: You may be able to take some classes at Wharton, but, you won’t be able to major in business. OTOH, Haverford has a very fine placement record for finance and business, comparable to other highly regarded LACs in the northeast U.S.

Both career centers will give you more details if you contact them.
You might also take a look at the econ and/or business professors and their research focus—what do you find most interesting? Also take a look at the course catalogs to compare curriculums and offerings.
Richmond is more than double the size of Haverford in terms of students, with more of a pre-professional feel. The campus is beautiful and suburban. Haverford is also a nice campus but with more of an urban feel. Good luck!

"I have to pop in to say that Haverford does not have an urban feel to my mind (as a BMC alum) – it has a duck pond, nature trails, and the traditional small liberal arts college vibe, all on 200 acres. It is located in Haverford – a wealthy suburb about 20 minutes from Philly, with shops off campus. Towns on the Main Line are about a mile apart, all connected by commuter rail to Philly. The area is considered one of the loveliest suburban areas in Philadelphia, with large homes from the turn of the century.
Haverford is also distinctive because of its Quaker traditions of mutual respect and notions of community, which influence everything from self-scheduled final exams to the tradition of Plenary, when students meet to reaffirm the Honor Code. Students do very well after graduation but it does not have a business program. Haverford and Bryn Mawr students can take up to 2 classes a term at U Penn, though the classes must be classes which are not regularly offered at either Haverford or Bryn Mawr, and Wharton and Engineering classes are excluded.

"This may be a case of splitting hairs, but, @Mwfan1921 has a point. Once you step off campus, the surrounding areas  of each college have a tangibly different feel. Delaware County (PA) is nearly four times more densely populated than Henrico County (VA). In fact, compared to Haverford, I’d be tempted to say that Richmond is more rural in feel. But, that, I’m sure, would inspire some pushback from others on this forum. Both are lovely, lovely campuses.

"@Anna20021988 I have been very fortunate to have 2 Ds who were Richmond Scholars. They both had great experiences at UR, with excellent professors and advising, small challenging classes, lovely campus and weather, not far from downtown Richmond, a fun city with great food, parks, museums and activities. The business school is excellent and students have great outcomes with internships and job opportunities.
One of my Ds studied abroad at St. Andrews University in Scotland, all paid for with her scholarship, with extra funding for travel and educational experiences while abroad. Another excellent program is the Sophomore Scholars in Residence, providing students the opportunity to take a class in a variety of subject areas with an integrated travel component, and the students are housed together for the year while taking the class, as well working on long term projects. The SSIR program is fully funded with no extra costs for students. In addition, UR guarantees a stipend of $4K to fund research or an internship.
A top student will not be a “token intellectual” at UR. 25% of students have a an SAT of 1460+ and/or ACT of 32+. My 2 Ds always felt that there were many other bright students in their classes to challenge each other and have thoughtful discussions.

"A little more info about URichmond: UR is not in a rural location(I say this as someone who live 40 miles from Philadelphia who is very familiar with both areas). It is located not too far from the busy Interstate 95 highway corridor. UR’s campus is in the sprawling suburbs of Richmond, about 10 mins. from downtown areas, including the very fun Carytown area, which is popular with students. There is lots of shopping, grocery stores, good access to medical care, etc. in the surrounding areas.
Richmond and its suburbs are certainly smaller and less populous than Philly and its suburbs, but hardly rural. Areas west of Richmond, heading towards the mountains in Shenandoah and the Charlottesville area where UVA is located are much more rural. That area is lovely with lots of farms, vineyards, parks and hiking, scenic views.
Richmond has 2 Amtrak rail stops, 1 downtown and 1 in the suburbs, which many UR students use. Richmond also has an international airport, although not gigantic, and the campus has shuttles available to accommodate student travel for breaks.
UR runs also shuttle buses to several shopping areas as well as to downtown Richmond. Students also use Uber ride sharing to get around, and many students have cars on campus, since parking is plentiful and inexpensive (although a car is not necessary, neither of my UR grads had one).

"Richmond is 10% international. Amazing food. In fact, an alum who was visiting campus wasn’t happy with his dessert a few years back, so funded an enormous gourmet dessert selection. Richmond has over a 2 billion dollar endowment! Huge for such a small LAC. (Haverford’s is about 500 mill). That’s why Richmond is so generous with funds to travel, research, study abroad, etc.
As for being a token intellectual, my S, not a richmond Scholar, had a 34ACT/1520 Sat, mostly As (until slacking senior yr) in rigorous curriculum (finished AP calc BC in 11th grade and took a discrete math topic 12th, Phys C, all told 8-10 APs (depending on how you count them)), so there are plenty of “smart” kids there. And, the curriculum is rigorous. Our somewhat immature son thought he could get by with the approach he took in senior year high school and learned the hard way (bad 1st sem grades), he needs to really study.
As for law school, have you looked at Richmond’s Philosophy, Politics, Economics and Law major? It’s what drew our S to Richmond. Kids LOVE that major. If you’re a Richmond Scholar, get a 3.8 or above GPA (which might be easier to get at Richmond than Haverford, idk) and take advantage of everything the school offers, you’ll be well set for the LSATs and a top law school.
Look into the first year Endeavors and sophomore scholars in residence programs. They are excellent. And with Endeavors, you’ll be coming to school a little early and living with like-minded individuals.

"One possible negative about Haverford. Its is very dominated by women, because Bryn Mawr is a women’s college and Haverford is about 52% or a little more,  women.  Since students mix freely between the two adjacent LACs, there is a definite dominance of women and less men to date if that matters to you.
The gender imbalance at Haverford/Bryn Mawr and the very small size makes socializing a bit more confined than a larger school like Richmond.
Haverford student body  is focused on  a very strong honor code. This means tests are not proctored.
Here is some ongoing discussion of this honor code.  The writers here look to be excellent !

"I’m not going to comment on URichmond, which I think is a great college.  I’m just going to comment on Haverford because I know much more about it than Richmond.  It’s not dominated by women.  Yes classes are shared in the consortium, and yes, most social events are open to both Haverford and BMC students, but honestly most of the BMC students are not spending tons of time at Haverford.  They chose BMC for a reason.
Second, yes you can take Penn classes, and many students do.  It’s not hard to get to Penn from Haverford.  But I don’t think going to Haverford just so you can take a few classes at Penn is a good reason to choose the college.  Students at Haverford want to be at Haverford, not Penn.  The culture is very different from the one at Penn, so perhaps if you love the Wharton vibe Haverford isn’t a match.
Haverford is filled with students who lean to the quirky/intellectual side.  It’s does not have the pre-professional vibe that Penn does.  It’s not very sporty, despite the fact that many students are on athletic teams.  It’s just another thing they might do on the side, not close to the most important thing they do.

"Much as I love Haverford (I was a Bryn Mawr grad from before Haverford was co-ed), I would not choose it primarily because it affords the chance to take classes at other schools, including Penn. Haverford is a small, distinctive community based on Quaker traditions of community and tolerance. While Haverford and Bryn Mawr students can take classes at Penn, that only applies to Arts and Sciences type classes – Wharton and Engineering classes are excluded – and is limited to classes which are not generally offered at Haverford and Bryn Mawr. I would discourage selecting Haverford with the idea that it is a “back door” to Penn.

"@Anna20021988 Law school acceptance is almost entirely gpa and LSAT scores and most students have to borrow $75,000 a year for 3 years to get through law school, so the general advice – similar to med school – is save money on undergrad to reduce loans and preserve any savings to pay for law school. On that basis, Richmond would be better option.
In terms of access to an exchange program with LSE – exchange programs with Oxford, Cambridge and, presumably, LSE, are usually very competitive for students applying to visit from US schools – the students we know who were admitted to the Oxford study abroad program were the “cream of the crop” at their respective universities. I tend to think that being a big deal scholarship recipient at Richmond would create more opportunities for research, leadership and other skills which would maximize acceptance into a competitive admissions study abroad such as LSE.
You said a tolerant community is important to you – and Haverford certainly meets that. But the other reasons you said you liked Haverford – its location and the opportunity to take classes at Penn (which does NOT include Wharton) does not seem like a strong reason to prefer Haverford.

"1 - I’m a parent of a Penn Stater and many parents of engineering students complain on the parents Facebook page about how their formerly 4.0 GPA kids are now struggling. Lots of weed out classes.  (And possibly a bit too much partying.). Google “PSU engineering entrance to major requirements” for details. Some majors require GPAs as high as 3.2.
2 and #3 - As your email or letter states, you were accepted into the COLLEGE but with an intended major...but not directly into the major.  You are technically in what PSU calls premajor status. To officially declare your major, you will have to successfully complete several courses with a C or better and hit a certain overall GPA, which varies depending on your major.  Civil engineering requires a 2.6 but biomedical, mechanical,  and chemical require a 3.2.  My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so.
4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.  Alumni network is the largest outside of Michigan and so the brand name goes far.

(And possibly a bit too much partying.). Google “PSU engineering entrance to major requirements” for details. Some majors require GPAs as high as 3.2.
2 and #3 - As your email or letter states, you were accepted into the COLLEGE but with an intended major...but not directly into the major.  You are technically in what PSU calls premajor status. To officially declare your major, you will have to successfully complete several courses with a C or better and hit a certain overall GPA, which varies depending on your major.  Civil engineering requires a 2.6 but biomedical, mechanical,  and chemical require a 3.2.  My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so.
4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.  Alumni network is the largest outside of Michigan and so the brand name goes far.

"@Amateurengineer to answer your questions concerning riding the bus at NC State.  Most of the freshmen classes will be on main campus (the weed out classes as has been mentioned).  They are building a pedestrian tunnel to connect the two campuses.  They also stagger the classes between the two, so it is not a problem if you do have classes on both, which my sons did a couple of times.  And like PSU above, NC State engineering, your are accepted into the college but not the specific major.  Once you complete your first set of math and sciences, you apply to the major of your choice and it is based on grades in these core classes. Typically aerospace and chemical will be among the harder to get into.
Good Luck.

"My vote goes to VT, but H and I being alumni might make us a wee bit biased. H actually turned down NC State for VT when he got accepted off the wait list, but that was a few moons ago.  H owns his own company now, so I think he turned out ok.
VT is similar that one gets into their specialty after the core courses unless they’ve changed recently.
The setting in Blacksburg is incredible. We loved our time there. It’s only improved since our day.
All that said, you could pick based upon finances or where you think you want to live once done and do just fine with degrees from any of your choices. We live in Penn State territory and know a fair number of successful grads from there too. Head down to NC where H is from and there are plenty of NC State grads doing well too.

"@Amateurengineer great info thanks so much.
The question I had however is - do all freshmen take the same courses in first year
or for Mechanical engineering you have your own set of major courses and for CS I  have my own set - which is ok to do and we maintain the GPA for these courses. Its also  ok if there are a few general courses
However if both departments are taking same set of courses it means many will get weeded out from the major they want isnt it?
Purdue and TAMU and Vtech states clearly that first year is General engg where all freshmen take same courses right?
However Calpoly SLO - you are taking classes related to CS from Day 1.
I would like someone to confirm if at Penn State - all freshmen are taking same set of classes or the set of classes pertaining to their major with a few common ones. This is important for making my decision.
Can anyone please confirm?

The question I had however is - do all freshmen take the same courses in first year
or for Mechanical engineering you have your own set of major courses and for CS I  have my own set - which is ok to do and we maintain the GPA for these courses. Its also  ok if there are a few general courses
However if both departments are taking same set of courses it means many will get weeded out from the major they want isnt it?
Purdue and TAMU and Vtech states clearly that first year is General engg where all freshmen take same courses right?
However Calpoly SLO - you are taking classes related to CS from Day 1.
I would like someone to confirm if at Penn State - all freshmen are taking same set of classes or the set of classes pertaining to their major with a few common ones. This is important for making my decision.
Can anyone please confirm?

For engineering?  You ought to find a different crowd to consult with.  Powerhouses in engineering are often different than powerhouses for other majors.  Doing a quick google search and just looking on the search page it appears they’re ranked #13.  ASU is #38.  PSU is #24.  Individual departments have their own ranking so one should look at what they are interested in if rankings matter.  As with anything else, different schools have a more directed engineering focus.
Overall though, in engineering circles, yes, VT is considered an academic powerhouse.  H has had headhunters after him pretty much his whole engineering career and even when doing projects on other continents, his VT degree was respected (since many of those folks cared about the name on his diploma as well as projects he’d already done).

The website may just be talking about engineering graduates in general?  You could reach out to the Engineering department if you want or need clarification on that. The bottom line-Virginia Tech produces tons of engineers and their graduates are sought after by many employers.

"@ucbalumnus  That is exactly the thought that came to my mind without the actual numbers.

"My daughter was accepted to Cornell, RPI, Case Western, Northeastern, Clemson, Stevens, Rutgers and Rowan in-state, all for engineering. She had a range from no aid to very good merit. We really, really struggled with the decision, but it came down to Cornell, ranked #11 for engineering, and VT, ranked #14.
Cornell was too expensive for us, and the other schools just didn’t measure up. She cried for 24 hours, then she was over it.
She is finishing up her freshman year. She made Deans list last semester (no worries about getting her first choice major) She lives in the engineering housing (Lee Hall, Hypatia  for women, Galileo for men) which has probably made a difference- everyone is taking the same classes and so they all have to study at the same times, no pressure to party when you should study.
My favorite part? Everyone seems so happy to be there. When we were wandering around campus trying to come to terms with turning down “an Ivy” , kids would literally just start talking to us. “Would your daughter like to see my dorm room? I live in Lee Hall” or telling us about their plans for graduate school, how their classes went, what they thought about work-life balance. Literally random girls we met while petting their dogs. Tons of cute dogs.
The parents we met at restaurants were nice, and many were alums. They showed us photos of their kids, they asked us to let them know what she decided. Every single person we met was so great. There were NINE rainbows on our drive home. It was just so great. It IS so great.
My friend is a CEO of a tech company in the research triangle. She says “some of the best engineers I hire are VT grads”
I’m sorry, I am a little biased, but, really, it’s the whole package. Rutgers is basically a commuter campus. I don’t know much about PSU engineering.

"My daughter is home for Spring break. She says her physics and chem classes were 200 people lectures, math classes 20-50 people, as are most other classes. Engineering was smaller first semester, around 30, now it’s about 50-60. They split up into working groups of 6 people in engineering. There is a one credit course you take if you are in Hypatia that’s a little GPA boost, it is mentoring and career events and 10 hours of community service which was honestly kind of fun for her at the beginning when she didn’t have a lot going on socially.
My daughters advice is that if you want better housing or a more social environment, pick O’Shaug or Peddrew-Yates. Pritchard is social but not nicer than Lee. But if you are concerned about work environment for freshman year, the engineering community helps for environmental reasons - no crowds wandering the halls when you are trying to study for a chem test - because they all have the same test.

"@ucbalumnus what I mean by “Rutgers is basically a commuter campus” is that there really isn’t a campus feeling. It is several campuses spread all over New Brunswick and Piscataway, and there are so many students who live nearby that the campus empties out every weekend. They go home. I live 45 minutes away, and even the kids who do live on campus freshman year usually move back home sophomore year because there just isn’t a lot going on.
You can only tell so much by reading about it. Sometimes you have to experience it. I took classes post grad for a couple of years. Excellent instructors, well-respected program. But it could be lonely for an OOS student, and, well…go HOKIES!

"@njdadjets - From what personal experience do you claim a “Stevens dilemma”? What dilemma? Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale’s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being “inexpensive” for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend.
In the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers).
Many scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.

Not sure why that would be a Stevens-specific issue.  Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).  But if the GPA minimum is something like 3.5, that can be more of an issue, since students have to protect their GPAs like pre-meds do.

Both UGA & IU-Kelley are great options. As a Direct Admit To IU-Kelley & to IU Honors College, it appears to be the better & wiser choice for your intended career path.
Your recent posts show that you are leaning toward the more comfortable option, but not necessarily the better opportunity. Are you afraid of leaving your comfort zone & facing the challenges of growing in a place where you will not have your current classmates & friends ?
IU has 34% from out-of-state, while the percentage of non-residents at UGA is 11%.
Direct Admit to a nationally respected business school is significant career wise. Being admitted to an Honors College is significant both academically & socially.

Kelley has offers some innovative, cutting edge & high demand specialties.
Nevertheless, I understand the charm of the South & the lure of Atlanta & Athens. But, direct admission to a high quality undergraduate business program is valuable, as is admission to the honors college.

"@grant123 I think you are looking at the academics differences between the two schools too closely.  Both schools have excellent accounting schools that Big 4 firms routinely and actively hire from.  Your career will start in Atlanta or Chicago, and both of those places are excellent for career growth.  Both schools are respected by people inside the industry, but people outside the industry just see state school.
How do I know this?  I graduated from UGA with a degree in accounting, moved far from the South, and now my wife’s best friend is an accounting grad from IU.  Go to the school that you like the fit, can get into the accounting school, and survive the accounting school.  A lot of kids get washed out of the accounting program at both schools.

If the cost difference over 4 years is this substantial, then UGA is the better option.

"@grant123: A difference of $25,000 to $27,000 per year is too much. One reason that I was unsure of the cost difference is that some state schools waive non-resident tuition surcharge (meaning a non-resident would just pay in state rates) if awarded a scholarship of any amount, including as little as $500. I cannot recall the state that was well known for this. (Not sure, but I thought it was either Iowa or Indiana. I was familiar with this regarding law school admission.)

"@grant123: Getting into undergraduate business schools is much more competitive today than it was 10 years ago. Part of the reason is that many refuse to pay high MBA tuitions plus sacrifice an income for 2 years during a full time MBA program. Today, many expect an undergraduate business degree to deliver what an MBA used to be used for. This has also given rise to one year specialty masters degrees in business such as marketing, marketing research, finance, data analytics, etc. instead of pursuing the traditional 2 year full time MBA.

So if you want to go to NY, those opportunities will be there. Terry is an excellent business school and will not hold you back. Their placement is excellent. IU, while an excellent business school, does not offer significantly better opportunities than UGA.

The ones that graduated last year and the seniors had/have excellent internships and full time jobs lined up by senior year, comparable to IU. Most Kelley grads stay in the Midwest (Chicago mostly) and Terry grads stay in the South (Atlanta mostly). That’s typical for big state schools.  Average/median salary differences not significant to begin with and are nonetheless due to cost of living differences. I would not decide based on USNews business rankings. Both are top notch business programs and your outcome from either will depend far more on what you do in college rather than whether you attend the higher ranked business program (IU is higher by 11 spots, which isn’t worth even close to $100k difference).

Please remember that many posters have sons & daughters & nieces & nephews at UGA & may have different, yet well founded, experiences & knowledge to share.
OP: It is fairly easy for you to check out recruiting at IU-Kelley versus UGA-Terry. An important factor relates to size of each schools’ respective MBA program.
UGA-Terry has about 103 full time MBA students while IU-Kelley has about 392 full time MBA students.
.
IU’s MBA program has higher admission standards than does UGA-Terry.
It is easy to verify which school attracts more recruiters.
Also, recruiting/placement opportunities are different for the approximate 20 Foundation Fellows at UGA then it is for other students so Deloitte & MBB & New York City recruiters are not banging down the doors at UGA.

"With respect to MBA school, the best programs typically demand 3 to 5 years of post undergraduate work experience. Certain firms & companies feed more employees into M-7 MBA programs than others. So, for a variety of reasons, post undergraduate placement is important. Because of Atlanta’s significance in the business world, great opportunities are available in Georgia. Because of IU-Kelley’s reputation, standards, programs & size, great opportunities are available from IU-Kelley.

"I can bring a little perspective into this OSU, IU, and UGA… All these schools are very similar in the sense that they are all large Public with a lot of rah rah rah and outstanding academics.  Daughter had the same dilemma last year. She was accepted to all these schools as well as other similar ones. She knew that money was going to be the deciding factor. She was a direct admit to Fisher and she was also able to secure a full-tuition scholarship at OSU bringing the overall cost of attendance on par with UGA (we are instate).  She was also interested in going out of state, Her acceptance to OSU and UGA came in at the same time (the Friday before Thanksgiving). After researching all the programs, acceptances, financials, and location, there is no doubt in my mind that she made the right decision. She absolutely LOVES OSU.
Financially speaking, OSU will be cheaper than IU by about $10K to $12K a year. So basically somewhere in between UGA and IU. Fisher is an amazing school perhaps not at the level of Kelley but very very close. Columbus is a city, but by no means, the size of  Atlanta, but lots of Fortune 500’s as well as upstarts are based out of there. It is between Cincinnati and Cleveland not to mention other major cities such as Pittsburgh and Indianapolis. After narrowing down some of her options, she decided that she wanted to be in a city.
We looked into Kelley and, it seems that a lot of people think to think they are tops.  IMHO, I do not think they are worth the premium, especially if you are not studying Finance and assuming, of course, you have similar options.  I know you have your hands full and this is not an easy decision. The University of Georgia is an amazing school and it probably would have been the school of choice if she did not attend OSU.  But there is something to be said about Direct admission and wanting to go OOS. But financials matter.   I know you have a lot of friends attending UGA or are going to be attending UGA, but if you want to hear the perspective a current Fisher student from Atlanta, I will be more than happy to get you in touch with my daughter. In addition, I know all these schools offer acceptance students days, etc. You might want to consider going to those in order for you to make sure you get a feel for what is like.
Finally, when she came home during the winter break, she had a chance to see all her friends who are currently attending other schools from all over the country. Schools such as Wisconsin, Arizona, Alabama, Texas, FSU, and UGA. EVERY SINGLE ONE of these kids loves their schools. They all found the perfect school. It goes to show you that by the end of the day, we all seem to struggle with these decisions, but whether location, financials, or size dictate the outcome, many end up very happy with their ultimate choice.

"By the end of the day, these are all good Business Schools. I honestly do not think Kelley is worth the premium over many similar schools. When we went through the process last year, the one thing that we got out of the acceptance visits was the ability to be able to get an internship.  It can be quite competitive, but after everything is said and done, it all comes down to the individual student, grades, and desire. All these students are fighting for the same internships.
As another poster pointed out, many seem to think that Kelley is as prestigious as Wharton. Not even close! It is not nearly as difficult to get into Kelley or IU as it is to get into Penn. I often hear “where do you go to school? I go to Kelley”  Please!!! Having said that, Kelley is a great school and IU is a great University. But overall, if the student is not a 100 percent sure that they are not going to stay in the Business School, the other schools have a better overall reputation. Also, when comparing pay scales between say Kelley and Terry, you have to remember that Kelley tends to send a lot of kids into Markets such as Chicago and NYC whereas UGA tends to send more students into Atlanta, Charlotte, and smaller cities in the South. The pay scales are different.
The OP and many who are in similar situations have to decide what makes sense to them. There are so many students whose parents can afford to send their kids just about anywhere. The difference between $100K to go out of state or stay instate might not mean anything. Is Kelley worth $100K more than UGA? Probably no.  But there are so many factors to consider.  The fact is that the in-state school will always cost much much less than the OOS school unless the students can secure close to an OOS waiver in order to make it somewhat cost competitive. So anyone applying to an OOS public should know all the scenarios.
Also, there is so much information out there in regard to scholarships, acceptances, etc.  It is a known fact that OOS applicants to IU with target scores can qualify for a scholarship that amounts to about $10K. The Ohio State University tends to offer about $12,500 and sometimes a little more with their Buckeye Scholarship. Anyone prior to applying should have known that there were going get x amount at IU, OSU, and UGA and with that all the what-if scenarios.

If something were to happen to a parents employment or its a difference of their retirement it does come into play.

"@grant123 A few pages back I posted about being a UGA accounting grad and my spouse’s best friend being an accounting grad from IU.  You asked if I liked UGA.  Yes, I did love UGA and the accounting program set me up for success, but that was 27 years ago and I am not you.
After reading all of the new posts I have to reiterate what I posted earlier.  For accounting there is not an academic difference in these two schools.   Employers have been hiring from these two schools for decades and have been shaping the curriculum for decades, and that gives the programs a trade school like feel.  Rankings matter, but when you drill down to something specific like accounting it’s more about your chances of landing a great first job.  Both schools will be heavily recruited by top accounting/consulting firms.
MBAs were mentioned earlier, and I would recommend not considering that.  I would recommend a masters in accounting, and then after a few years out in the real world decide if you want an MBA.  Both schools will allow you to attend an excellent MBA program.
What brought me back to this thread was that I had dinner last night with the IU grad mentioned above.  We both agreed that within accounting groups our degrees are respected, but outside of that group it’s just a business degree from a state school.  Both of us loved our time in college and feel like it set us up for success.
Good luck in your search!

"Agree that for those studying just accounting, most any accredited school will suffice. But for those venturing into a double major such as accounting & finance, then quality of the finance program & its students does matter.
Not discussed in the post above are the tremendous benefits of IU’s Hutton Honors College–regardless of one’s major–and the benefits of Business Honors & its clubs as well as advantages of being a direct admit to the business school which enables one to build meaningful professional relationships from the first semester on campus.
Recruiting has changed over the past 27 years. Best to be part of a nationally respected business school if seeking competitive positions outside of the school’s geographic region.
Telling one to disregard the affiliated MBA program at each business school is very poor advice with respect to the rapidly evolving changes in marketplace demands. It is almost as ridiculous as an earlier posted who suggested that you ignore the advantages of the Hutton Honors College (to which OP barely qualified). The people with whom you associate during your college years will have a dramatic effect on both your undergraduate experience & upon future professional connections.

But OP is young & needs to determine whether he wants to relax & enjoy during his first year or is ready to study & build career connections. Both paths are fine. Just no need to spend the extra funds if not ready to take advantage of being a direct admit & Hutton Honors & working toward Business Honors.

"@alwaysmoving: In your most recent post in this thread, you recommend against getting an MBA in favor of a Masters in Accounting for an accounting major. Why ?
The Masters in Accounting has become a widespread offering due to the increased hours required for CPA license eligibility.
Wouldn’t it be better for an accounting major to get a specialty masters in order to expand their attractiveness to employers ?
Also, the Indiana-Kelley MBA is just a one academic year addition–just like a Masters in Accounting–so it is worth investigating even without the typical 3 to 5 years expected by the elite MBA programs.
So my question is: What good is a Masters in Accounting for an accounting major beyond getting the additional 30 hours for CPA license eligibility which could be accomplished by earning a specialty masters ?

"I don’t want to hijack the thread, but hopefully answering your question will be valuable to the OP or another viewer in a similar situation.
A masters in accounting has become the norm for someone staring out from schools like IU or UGA.  It’s not required, but it’s definitely something that you should get while you’re there.
Why not a MBA?  The OP will take a variety of business classes and have a solid base in management when they leave school.  Plus there will be ample on the job training in their first 5 years.  Adding an MBA after those 5 years might be helpful, but most likely it won’t.  Getting an MBA after a MACC will most likely cause employers to think you are chasing credentials, and that is a dangerous tag these days.
So what extra education would I recommend to a an accounting grad?  Something in tech like a coding or software engineering bootcamp.  More and more the people around me tackle business problems like a software developer instead of like an MBA, and understanding that methodology and terminology would be beneficial.

"I’m a parent so take this for what you will. Visited both schools with my daughter and full disclosure am a Vassar grad. My daughter and I found the opposite of what you’re expecting about the students. Vassar students were more down to earth, seemed happy and I would not describe as New York wanna bes. We both found more of a pretentious vibe at Kenyon and not one person looked up or smiled. The folks in admissions, including the student interviewer my daughter met with, were down right rude with a snobby air. Also Kenyon is very isolated so that’s a consideration as well. Poughkeepsie leaves a lot to be desired but the area around campus is nice and NYC is an option although it’s not so close that you’d be heading there every weekend. We saw confederate flags all over the area near Kenyon - a huge turn off for us at least. I know others will have other opinions - maybe we just hit Kenyon on a bad day.  Best of luck.

Kenyon feels – your mileage may vary – like a place where city, private school kids go. Of course, that is not the only demographic at Kenyon, but it definitely feels more wealthy, more homogenous (and is) than some peer schools. Greek life is about 25% at Kenyon, and though students don’t live in the greek life houses, the housing office designates certain blocks of dorm rooms  for members of specific chapters, so that greek life members live together.

"As the one person here who has a child who attends Kenyon, I encourage you to carefully consider my opinion and my daughter’s experience.
A little background. My daughter is not a city, private school kid. She was educated in a public school system in rural New England. At Kenyon she has many friends from all sorts of places and backgrounds. While diversity might be an issue, the school has made a serious effort to attract a diverse student body. These efforts have resulted in the most diverse first-year class in the school’s history.
Confederate flags. I have driven to Kenyon five times. Not once have I seen a Confederate flag. Do the residents of the surrounding area lean right? Yes. Has that adversely affected my daughter? No. Area residents are friendly, down-to-earth and kind. We have had numerous interactions in local businesses and not once felt out-of-place or unwelcome. The faculty and student body lean left, and there is an active, vibrant social justice element on campus. How do I know this? Because my daughter is part of it. She has participated in numerous peaceful protests, made a trip to North Dakota during her first year to support the NoDAPL movement, and currently lives in program housing with Eco-Kenyon, which is the school’s environmental club.
As for a snobby, self-absorbed student body, this simply is not the case. Her experience, and mine when visiting, could not be further removed from this notion. We found happy, friendly students, a helpful, genuine admissions staff, and an overall pleasant atmosphere throughout campus when we initially visited. This first impression has continued to be her experience.
Greek life at Kenyon? Yes, it exists, but for those who (like my daughter) don’t choose to join, there are plenty of  alternative social options.
My daughter loves her school, so much in fact that after considering the prospect of junior year abroad, she chose to remain at Kenyon. She has had fantastic, inspiring, kind and supportive professors. Her classroom experience has been enhanced by engaging and intellectual peers.
So, OP, my advice to you would be to thoughtfully consider what you felt when visiting these schools. As it went with my daughter, Vassar and Wesleyan were both on her list. We visited each more than once, as they were of great interest to her. She also loved Hamilton, even more than these two schools. Ultimately, though, after a deferral ED1 at Hamilton, we visited Kenyon and it rose to the top as an ED2 choice. She couldn’t be happier with her decision.

"@apple23: I think that everyone reads & respects all of the posts in this thread. It is wonderful that your daughter found a match school. But other posters’ experiences matter as well.

It is noteworthy that, according to your prior posts, that your daughter wanted to major in English which is Kenyon’s strength.

"@Publisher I swear that almost every school has some “drinking culture”. I have yet to meet a college student who says there isn’t a lot of drinking on their campus - whether it is a big school, small school, rural, urban, etc. I have a friend whose daughter is a freshman at ND and her roommate is drinking four nights a week. The dorm is a party. My niece is a freshman at a big ten school. All kinds of drinking. I’m guessing that, at most schools, students can choose to drink or not drink and it’s their own choice. Both my friend’s daughter and our niece have chosen to find like-minded kids in their classes and in club activities and they do not drink. But, yes, Kenyon is rural. Probably about as rural as they get. Lots of kids like that about rural LACs. I’m guessing it’s figured out early on in most kids’ searches if they like that kind of campus or not.

My thought is that Kenyon is relaxed and creative. The professors are HIGHLY regarded and consistently hold several spots in Princeton Review’s Best Prof list. Students really enjoy classes.

"There are many schools that have created Alcohol/Drug task forces besides Kenyon, such as Lehigh, Dartmouth, Amherst to name just a few. Binge drinking is a pervasive problem at many schools. Some schools have banned hard alcohol on campus as a result of these findings, i.e., Dartmouth.
Regarding Kenyon (or any school) the best source (but not perfect) for campus drinking, drug, and rape statistics is the Clery report. All schools have to report these numbers annually. In Kenyon’s case when you calculate average drinking and drug infraction incidence (taking into account size of student body) over last 3 years, Kenyon’s incidence is high relative to many schools of similar size like Hamilton, Bowdoin and Williams. Again, these stats are not perfect and can reflect school by school reporting differences, or even how actively campus police/RAs, etc,  are looking for drugs/alcohol, but it is decent data nonetheless.

Lehigh University has long had an usually high incidence of substance abuse.

Macalester might be similar in some ways, and it is in a city – a big city. But it would feel more urban than Vassar.
Carleton maybe? But it isn’t really known for outstanding humanities, though being a top LAC kind of implies strength in them.

"Binge drinking is a problem at many schools, large and small and there have been tragedies at many schools. I can’t recall the source, but I’ve read that greek life, high varsity athletic participation, and rural location each contribute to campus drinking culture. Many students choose not to partake at lots of schools but, like the “how to avoid lax bro culture” in another thread, for students who are looking to avoid a dominant scene, it is helpful to really talk to a lot of students and possibly spend time on campus on a Wed (usually a big party night) or weekend night and see for themselves. Even then, it is hard to put in perspective – my non-drinking high school senior was shocked by the party scene at some schools, but now partakes, usually in moderation, I think. So what a 17-18 year old thinks may change.
I was one of the parents who described our experience with Vassar and Kenyon. Kenyon is a wonderful school, wonderful faculty, engaged students. It was the first school each of my kids visited and their first choice early in the process. Eventually, it came off the list, with size and location being part of that decision.  But what was right for them is not a predictor for anyone else. My perception of the student body from visits plus knowing several recent grads and current students, is that there is a sophistication about many of the students that feels “urban/east coast.” I would contrast that with, say, Grinnell, which is also a wonderful school with wonderful faculty and engaged students, but feels more “midwest nice” than “east coast cool.” Of course, there are students who don’t fit that description at either school. Your mileage may vary.
For folks who know, I have been genuinely curious about how the Kenyon greek life housing clusters feels to non-greek life students and whether the chapter houses can be used for parties or not.

You’ve called attention to internal documents, not a comparative report. Kenyon’s purpose in this case was to look directly, honestly and even harshly at their own institution for the determination of needed change. This should be regarded as a positive development. The analysis – though I haven’t read it fully – does not appear intended to compare Kenyon to other colleges by the standards of social science. For the purposes of this thread, which requires meaningful comparisons across institutions, the documents would seem to provide little insight.

"Have you visited Vassar? did you feel that it had a ‘wannabe New Yorker vibe’ that was less welcoming than Kenyon? If you haven’t visited, I would get my skates on and visit before committing to a school ED- the cost of a quick trip will only be a fraction of the cost of a getting there & finding you aren’t happy!
@prezbucky’s list is a good summary of ‘usual suspects’! There is a lot of applicant overlap between them.
IMO, the crucial thing about these schools, which appeal to so many of the same kids, and which are similar in so many fundamental ways, actually do ‘feel’ very different (as you can see from the above posts).
I knew- before my collegekid did- which of these schools she would end up choosing, b/c I saw how she responded to it, viscerally, at re-visit day. She hadn’t even been that keen to go that day- she had already visited the school, done an overnight, sat in on a class, etc, and figured she knew pretty much all she needed to know (plus, it was the last of the re-visits & she was burning out). Her response to the day was just different than to the other schools: it was clear that she felt at home there, in a way that she had not at any of the other, pretty similar, schools.
tl;dr: Go with your instincts- where did you feel most at home? Both schools are very campus-centric- that will be home for a long 4 years. Trust yourself.

"I’d like to chime in and just share my daughter’s experience— she is currently a freshman at Kenyon. We live in Ohio and most of the students at her high school chose to attend OSU, OhioU, Miami U or Dayton. The drinking/party culture at those schools did not appeal to her and she was looking for a very different college experience. Vasser, Grinnell, Carleton were all on her list— she was looking for many of the same things the OP noted. I will tell you so far, she has nothing but excellent things to say about Kenyon— she absolutely loves it. She says there are plenty of things to do on the weekend besides go to parties… often times so many different things that she has to choose one over the other when she’d like to do both. And in addition, my introverted kid says she actually enjoys going to the parties on campus… they are fun, “people actually dance” lol her words, and sometimes she chooses to have a beer and other times not. No one cares either way. She’s an athlete and enjoys hanging out with the team, but also has other friends she goes out with as well. She is busy all the time… I wish she’d call more! We are extremely close so it’s an adjustment not hearing from her every day but I am so thankful she is loving Kenyon as much as she is and is not homesick (yet at least!) I know it’s still early, but I honestly didn’t think the adjustment to college would be so smooth. She says it is an incredibly supportive community and the people there are very down to earth, interesting and like minded when it comes to being serious about genuinely learning new things etc.
Interestingly enough tonight when I called she had just come from a mandatory meeting at her dorm (bi monthly I believe) called beer and sex LOL where they talk about drinking responsibly on campus etc. So it seems the administration is not blind to what from my perspective seems like “average” college drinking… but then I’m comparing it to what I know about schools like Dayton and OU… where drinking is pretty much the only weekend activity available. Just the perspective of one student… but this was a thread I would have stalked like a hawk a year ago when we were looking, and I am so glad she made the decision to attend Kenyon— So much so my middle child is considering it after seeing how happy her big sis is.

Both Kenyon and Vassar are excellent schools.  You seemed to like both.  And, yes, despite its isolation, Kenyon’s campus is gorgeous (Vassar’s is no slouch either).  What do young people call it?  Hogwarts-like?
Unless something seriously knocks either school out of contention between now and November+, apply to both.

You asked about the social feel. Vassar has a really nice social environment. People are friendly and intellectually oriented, and people tend to form lasting friendships, especially with people in their dorm.
Its legacy as a former women’s college may contribute to the fact that not only does it not have any actual frats, but overall it has an inclusive feel to it and not much of a good-old-boy contingent. It is the polar opposite of a frat-dominated college.
Theatre is big and wonderful at Vassar. So is social justice. But you also can find kids who love sports and all types of other interests.

"No “axe to grind”. Kenyon College’s issues with respect to drinking have been well publicized for years after the death & near death of some students . At least one found dead in nearby corn field. Kenyon administrators also acknowledge that it is an ongoing issue of a serious nature.
Kenyon’s campus is beautiful, but small.
And, yes, heavy drinking is not uncommon at small, rural, isolated colleges.

",2,Vassar College,Kenyon College,2,157-2014188-vassar-vs-kenyon,42
"Regarding the statement “heavy drinking is not uncommon at small, rural, isolated colleges.”
This is true, however the thing to keep in mind (and look for if you are trying to avoid a school with a party/drinking culture) is does the college provide other opportunities on the weekend AND are they well attended. Kenyon’s plays sell out on Saturday nights, and my daughter has gone to several improv shows. They are standing room only—the students attend these activities! Rocky horror picture show, Harry Potter themed fun, a game of murder mystery held in one of the commons are all activities she has mentioned just in this first semester. Of course many kids go to parties afterward (my daughter usually does one of the two weekend nights) but being an athlete she sometimes turns in early or just hangs out in a friend’s dorm after going to the campus activities.
I went to an unranked small catholic college myself, and there were never activities offered on campus like that… or if they were, hardly anyone went. That is the key to look for in my opinion if you have a child who wants to do more than go to parties every weekend. Look to see what the college does offer, AND do the students attend! I tend to think because Kenyon is so rural that administration makes a conscious effort to provide opportunities on the weekends. Schools that have a big city near by often times don’t bother because so many students just leave campus. Another reason that small/rural can contribute to a real sense of community. At least that has been my daughter’s experience so far.

"The tragic Kenyon death that @Publisher continuously refers to occurred in 2005. That’s quite long ago, and much has changed at the school since then with respect to substance use awareness and education. As parents of current Kenyon students, @2manycollegequestions4me and I have seen our daughters have great social experiences while taking advantage of many extracurricular opportunities that do not involve alcohol.
Drinking related tragedies happen every year on college campuses. Do we paint Penn State, Clemson, Lafayette, Middlebury, Boston University, University of Chicago and UC San Diego all with the same broad stroke, and without consideration of circumstances and statistics? All of these schools have had students die in alcohol related incidents since the 2005 death at Kenyon. Note also, they are not all LACs in rural locations.
Again, any student death is a tragic occurrence. However, I think we need to keep the Kenyon incident in perspective.

It was a big factor in my daughter’s decision as she wanted a place where she would fit in and find people she had things in common with.

"@merc81: Kenyon College’s Alcohol Task Force was found in September 2016 to consider and recommend strategies for the Kenyon community to address the high-risk practices and behavior related to the presence and consumption of alcohol on campus.
Rather than guess, why not read the Kenyon College Alcohol Task Force Report of March 2017. It will be easy to cherry pick quotes supporting one’s position but the merit is in the totality of the effort.
Again, I find this to be an admirable reactive effort.
Of course, there is alcohol consumption on almost all college campuses, but it is a more dominant culture on some campuses than others. I believe that it was a Harvard study that defined the major risk factors/prototype schools. Kenyon fits the profile in theory & in fact. Doesn’t mean that every student drinks or drinks excessively or that anyone is forced to drink. On the other hand  ignorance is bliss.

"I’m happy for the OP that they chose to apply ED1 to Kenyon. It’s a wonderful school. I wanted to post something on this discussion because I feel that there’s some misinformation being put out here, or at least information that doesn’t jibe with my own experience.
I looked at Vassar early on in my college search. It’s a great school, but it felt too much like the private high school I attended in San Francisco. That’s a personal perspective, obviously. My high school teammate is now playing at Vassar and loves it.
My final college choices were Oberlin, Carleton, Macalester, Bates and Kenyon. All great schools. Of these, Kenyon felt the most comfortable for me. I’m interested in the humanities (a likely English major) and Kenyon’s offerings in this area seemed to be the strongest of those colleges. I loved the look of Kenyon’s campus, and after 4 years of high school in the middle of San Francisco, I was also attracted to the rural setting of Kenyon.
As to the drinking culture at Kenyon, some of what’s being presented on this thread doesn’t ring true to me. Of course, there is drinking at Kenyon. But I have never felt pressured to drink, there are many students who do not drink, and I have rarely seen anyone out of control at a party. In fact, Kenyon students seem especially attuned to the dangers of excessive drinking, and we are all educated about the known linkages between alcohol consumption and other problems like sexual assault. I think Kenyon’s administration does a great job in this regard.
As to Kenyon’s Greek scene, I think this may be misunderstood unless you’ve experienced it up close. Kenyon’s Greek organizations are more like community service clubs than traditional fraternities and sororities. Yes, most of the Greek organizations throw parties, but they are open to the whole Kenyon community. Fraternities and sororities at Kenyon don’t live together (generally) and I’ve always found them to be quite inclusive even if you’re not a member. I think they add a lot to the campus social scene.
The assertions on this thread that Kenyon has problems with alcohol consumption are untrue in my experience. I’d suggest - respectfully - that unless you go to Kenyon, or are an alum, parent, or employee, then perhaps you don’t have the highest-quality information to report.

She ultimately decided it was a non-issue when she heard from several students things like “The frat guys here are poets” LOL.

In addition, it is a horrible question because we don’t know what you will major in, the courses and professors you would take at each, and how they will grade.  We don’t know, so stop asking.
Leave your confusion behind on the medical school admit rates.  You either have a great application or you don’t.  If you went to a state school with a 35% rate but were excellent versus the rest of the student body and your performance reflected it, you would very likely get in unless you can’t interview well.  There are so many things that affect these numbers that you need to just stop being confused, visit places and choose somewhere you actually fit, and do well.  That is how you get to your next destination.  These percentages have nothing to do with what YOU and your situation and performance will be.

You already asked about competition and I don’t know anything about UR’s academic environment.  Emory’s was already answered.
Your thing about weed-out is just false (UR has engineering, and engineering curricula everywhere and especially at selective schools are very challenging, but that has nothing to do with pre-med classes.  From my comparisons of course materials in the life sciences, Emory is among the harder schools ranked between 13 and 25 or so).  Every student at every damned school claims that pre-med courses are weedouts.  If you compared the actual courses between elite schools you would either find out that there is no difference, or that one student body was exaggerating to a ridiculous extent.  If you want to keep saying this with no evidence than hearsay, please avoid Emory because what you “heard” will lead you to a path of misery.   Pre-med is going to be hard at any selective university.  To even try to split hairs between selective schools without seeing course materials is a waste of time so stop doing it.  If you are concerned, choose schools much less selective than either of these and stop saying this part and the stuff about the GPA every time you post.

Both are excellent schools with lots of clinical and research opportunities convenient to the main undergrad campus. And both are rigorous and respected without being known for cut-throat academics or grade deflation (or inflation, either, for that matter).  But, yes, you’ll also find “weed out” courses at both schools as well.
Remember, too, MOST students do not go to undergrad and med school at the same institution.  So, size of med school class or reserved places for REMS is sort of immaterial.  Some of the best schools for pre-meds are LACs that have no direct ties to med school but provide excellent education and good pre-med advising.

I’d think the strategic goal of your education would include best preparing you to take on the profession you are considering.

Taking what is perceived to be the “easy” route (according to the candidate) is one med school admissions frowns upon (as told to us by med school admissions reviewers when the above mentioned lad was contemplating pre-med), so you might want to consider rewording questions, etc.
Your best odds at getting into med school come from your putting in the effort studying to get good grades and an MCAT score while simultaneously getting the experiences needed within the medical field. I’ve seen students do this from many different schools - small religious LACs to large state schools and anything in between.  The common denominator is they worked to do it (and had the ability to do it), not which school they went to.  Their applications were attractive due to their accomplishments - not due to anyone freely giving them something.
I see very little difference between Emory and U Roc as destinations for undergrad.  What you do at either will be the tipping point.  Definitely consider finances as med school is expensive.  Definitely consider what you “like” because students often do better where they are happier.  Consider what your Plan B is too.  Every potential med school candidate should have one as many do not make it in.  That’s just the way it is.

"@SBSapphire  The two schools are peers academically.  You might find an easier or tougher Prof at either one of them TBH (or any other school), but both have their reputation due in part to the reputation for their academics and research.  Both schools have students who successfully get into med school each year.  Both schools have those who don’t.  Whether those who don’t could have if they’d made a different choice is debatable. Statistics never apply to the individual.
FTR, my pp to you wasn’t meant to be condemnation.  It was meant to get you to seriously look at your presentation, because that matters.  Tact matters in several aspects of life.
From those I’ve seen from the high school I work at, the students who are most successful at getting admitted to med school are those who select a school where they are in the Top 25% of incoming students (unless at a lottery school where “all” are really at that level with a point or two here or there being meaningless).  They also have a good work ethic from high school and don’t suddenly arrive at college freshmen year changing their major (or minor) to “party.”  They join things and have fun, but remember to put studying and truly learning the material as their top focus.  They ask questions when they don’t understand something.
My theory as to why they do better when they are in the Top 25% (GPA and SAT/ACT) is confidence level.  Those stats tend to show a similar foundation of academics.  Many classes in college start at the “average” level for incoming students.  When students get into a class where they’re “behind” others they tend to feel they are “dumb” compared to the class.  That’s not necessarily true as it’s often a foundation gap they could fill in, but they think it is and get stressed/discouraged.  When they feel “up” with their peers, or on the higher end, it’s a good boost to confidence letting them feel they can continue to take on anything/everything.  It’s a theory (hypothesis if I want to get technical), so take it as you wish.  If you aren’t in the Top 25% for either school, you might want to consider others - or know you could have to work a little bit more at the beginning to close an occasional gap or two in the introductory classes (and that’s ok - you just have to actually do it).
Best wishes to you no matter where you ultimately choose.  There’s nothing wrong with wanting a medical career.  You don’t want to give yourself more hurdles by not understanding the whole process.  How you come across at each stage is part of that process.

Yes. You can expect to be in classes where it will be very difficult to earn an A. Unlike hs where As can be handed out like pez candy, perhaps only 15-20% of a class will get As.  You will face weeding out at both schools. You will be sitting in chem, physics, etc classes with not only other premeds, but also with other  bright non premed chem, physics majors, etc, all who are trying to earn the limited number of As a prof hands out.
Premed is hard everywhere. I’ve seen estimates that suggest 70ish% of those who start as premed change their minds for any number of reasons. Of those who actually apply, 60% will fail to start anywhere. Agree with @ Creekland, a Plan B is vital. https://www.aamc.org/download/321442/data/factstablea1.pdf
Both schools will offer you the opportunities and resources to be a successful med school applicant. Whether you do so will be dependent mostly on you and your efforts, less on the school attended. Good luck.

"@Creekland :  I just don’t know how the hell we are to compare the rigor of two schools.  I actually look at the course materials and still don’t think I can get a truly representative depiction of how academics would “feel” at two schools.  Take for example the comparisons I did back in the day with chemistry and biology courses.  I have found that even in cases where professors at X school for X course where generally different/more challenging in terms of content and testing style than professors at Y school for X course, that often the students at Y claim that their course is still very challenging even in cases where the student body qualities were similar or Y was higher AND both schools had similar grading practices in STEM, which means that even my approach using raw course materials has limitations.  I for example cannot account for whether or not student/intellectual (I do not conflate this with incoming stats.  Institutions with similar or different stats can have vastly different intellectual vibes and tendencies with respect to how students pursue academics and even what majors they tend to pursue) culture is different at each and maybe one school receives a certain type of course differently than those at another or if the instructor teaching the “harder” course used more effective methods to encourage student success at one school, so thus students at the school with the “harder” course complain less about it.
To ask us to compare two schools of high caliber based upon “personal opinion” and hearsay has even more limitations.  I need people to stop asking about this.  It is too messy.  It would honestly just be better if they researched to perhaps stumble upon some course materials at whatever schools so that they can at least gauge where they stand versus the level of cognitive demands by professors in whatever department at each.  And then after that, you just cross your fingers for effective teaching if the material is found to be more difficult than expected.  Either way, I think so many ask the wrong questions and go about finding answers in a misguided way. The best I could do for these folks is give them links to course materials and maybe commenting on them or describing the courses I know about from my school if material from the other is unavailable.  But anyone saying: “Oh this school definitely is harder and has more weedouts” is usually making a baseless assumption not even supported by grade data or any course materials.  I see so many myths spread based upon “gut feeling” and hearsay such as X, Y, and Z have worse grade deflation versus A, B, and C, and then data tells a completely different story or exposes the first group as hyperbolic or unaware.
@mom2collegekids :  I was being sarcastic.  That is basically what I was saying.  This poster has asked this question in every single thread they posted on comparison of schools and otherwise.  So I was getting annoyed.
@Jugulator20 :  It is tough, but usually only intro. classes have grade distributions like that. As courses become less exam based, the distribution usually shifts to a more rightward skew.  I don’t like looking at grading distributions of only the As anyway, because to be honest, most successful pre-meds can afford  a couple of B grades here and there, and there are usually plenty of opportunities to boost the STEM GPA while also learning at a high level to balance out those “potential B courses”.  The fact is, privates and elite publics are often very generous with the B range grades.  Admittedly courses like gen. physics and chemistry may give out a decent chunk of Cs which could be dangerous, but there is some room for error in these challenging environments, especially in courses with low test averages where the grades get re-centered using a curve.

"@bernie12   Perception seems to mean a whole lot to students.  It can really affect how well they do even at the high school level.  I combat that all the time with students who were slower to develop math skills thinking they must be “dumb” and not even trying.  I see it as an end result with adults who go back for a degree later in life terrified of math, take Alg, and wonder “why couldn’t I get that in high school?”
For med school only GPA matters (not rigor) for academics, so if a student thinks they can do well, they usually do.
There is a difference that my lad has seen once in med school.  His undergrad classes (U Roc) seem to have prepared him very well for the coursework.  He tells us many of his peers in med school are envious asking him how he already knows X.  “I learned it in undergrad.”  Whether that came from his college, major, or specific classes/profs that differed is impossible to tell, esp with anecdotal data.  In any case, in med school they teach you everything you need to know, so if one doesn’t have a head start, they just have to put a little more time into learning it then.  That’s similar to some folks getting material in undergrad in a 201 or 301 course instead of 101.  (I’ve seen this happen via tests - what’s covered in a higher level research school’s 101 course for “everyone” can be in a later course for majors at a different school.)
When kids from my school are hoping to go to med school and ask for my advice it’s simple.  Look for an affordable school you like where you’re in the Top 25% of entering stats, read U Roc’s School of Medicine Class Profile for a few years (changing the URL to get more years), then work to become a student they like on your application.  This makes the assumption that U Roc’s SOM is similar to others in what they look for in applicants, but I highly suspect they are.

"@Creekland :  That is pretty much what I try to convey, that it is up to what the student does and how they perform.  All this worrying about what GPA/environment a school will GIVE some one as they try to pursue medical school always concerns me because it basically says: “Oh my success is mainly based upon others, and not what I do to study, learn, and develop myself professionally”.  It is a red flag for me to see these posts with “I have high stats from achieving well in high school, but I just want ease and am concerned about rigor” because what you said is right, confidence is important, and I have seen it plus great work ethic and willingness to really think take many students a long way at even these very selective schools like Emory and Rochester. Weirdly enough, it often didn’t even matter what their stats were relative to their “competition” unless they were extremely low versus it.  if they were remotely in ballpark and had developed good study habits, confidence, and a great attitude towards learning, many of these students (that I mentored) would perform well in what are considered hard renditions of courses.  And interestingly, there is a hierarchy (I explained this in another thread at Emory) where you have some key STEM professors that are known to be more intellectually challenging than average for both Emory or elite schools in general, yet they have garnered popular support (there are still students who avoid them, but usually they teach a slight majority of students when other sections are offered) among students because not only do they demand development very high analytical skills (assuming most students, especially younger ones don’t have it), but because they teach the material in a very effective and engaging way, and are also very effective mentors of students no matter how large their section size is.
Getting at least a B range grade in many of these professors’ courses really means you learned at a high level and usually these instructors will write really strong recommendation letters for students who scored in that range that showed themselves developing well during the course (and even better ones for students they managed to keep up with after the class).  In same cases, that range of students may even be selected as TAs (A students are not always the only ones who are enthusiastic, and we all know some don’t know how to teach or collaborate with students effectively).  As you said for your son at Rochester who went to med.  Students who at least engaged some of these courses and professors, would likely be a step ahead in some or many places in the pre-clinical sciences curriculum at medical schools.  In addition, Emory from what my friends and mentees who did it right told me from their experience, were very well prepped for those more research focused medical schools and MDPhD programs because so much of the life sciences curriculum (including biology which is notorious at most schools for being mostly about memorization throughout the whole thing) has migrated to a focus on research techniques, experimental design, data analysis, and just thinking like a scientist (so many of the most standard biology classes may require students to discuss and present primary literature in whatever field.  It is the best idea ever IMHO.  Even many sophomore level courses have it.  It sends the message that the field nor course are just about “the facts” and also holds students accountable for the foundation they supposedly gained in intro. biology courses, because chances are if you forgot most things or got poor training, reading the literature is all the more challenging because it assumes readers know about a threshold of ideas and techniques already), things that help folks do well on the MCAT and ease transition into research labs.  In addition, students are much more likely to retain the material if it is put in context of real research and real life scenarios as opposed to it being a bunch of facts and details thrown at students for them to remember and regurgitate back.
We all know medical schools want a strong GPA, but I think it is important for incoming prospies to think about how they can achieve it (and no it need not be a 3.8 in most cases, as nice as that would be) without having to actively lower their exposure to the right type of rigor.  There is no point in completely compromising your learning outcomes and skill development for looking good on paper for medical schools.  There are ways to be strategic and studious (as most students going to selective schools are obviously smart, high achieving cookies)  to ensure that you can perform well in most cases, while optimizing learning outcomes.  And as I said, even those shooting for at least a 3.7 or 3.8 have room for error.  I mentored students with over a 3.85 that have gotten several B/B+ grades.  One guy was so bold he chose an uncomfortable non-STEM course where he knew a B was possible each semester just because he wanted to take the best professors or work on his writing.  These students were very talented and toughened themselves up though.  They developed great study skills by taking early courses that laid a foundation for them to do well in other challenging coursework in the future.  That way, they weren’t totally screwed or shocked if they later  hit professors asking them to think outside the box or do even more (or different type) work than normal.
Their approach made me wonder about the motto of """"just build confidence as a freshmen by taking it easy:  I personally think this depends on the person, and for many who are confident and have a background/preparation to do otherwise, they may do themselves a service by really challenging themselves in a course or two as a freshmen.  Making that decision requires confidence, work ethic, a good attitude towards learning and feeling challenged (likely a growth mindset with respect to learning-  What you described with the algebra thing is a fixed mindset and unfortunately I think grade school teachers often play a role in conveying to students that “only those with seemingly natural aptitude in an area can be truly successful” which is likely why you have high achievers fearing for their life being amidst a bunch of people that make them look average or normal versus their achievements and test-taking ability) maturity, and something more than short-sighted goals of course.

It definitely depends upon the person and is another area where one needs to fit the school and course selection to the student.
Among a group of puppies, some are naturally outgoing and adventurous and some are more wary.  Most of the wary ones can do just fine, but they need more exposure.  There’s nothing wrong with that.  It’s still a “Train up a ‘puppy’ in the way they should go” deal (vs the way one feels “everyone” should be trained up).  It’s the end success that matters, not the means to get there.  (Success being defined the same for both, of course.)
Students who love learning and challenge often love the big research schools (or any challenging class in any school) - challenge accepted.  Others, not so much.  It’s all ok.  One just can’t put a square peg into a round hole because they think that’s the only way one can succeed.  That’s when failure tends to happen.
FWIW, this is not at all about lowering the bar with final knowledge - wanting pure memorization instead of true learning.  That’s its own issue and definitely grates on my nerves as an educator when it’s an end goal for any level of learning.  It’s been around forever.  I recall not really understanding Calc until I got to actually use it in Physics.  My students do well in high school because I emphasize teaching them how to reason and think, not because I teach them “Step 1 is to do this.”  Granted, vocab has to be mostly memorized, but once that language is learned, most of the rest can be reasoned out.  Some vocab can be reasoned out as well if one knows root meanings.  The teachers considered the best by students at our school are those who teach (in an understandable way) using concepts for real life applications.  But that’s totally different than whether a student will do better with challenge or confidence building.

"I also think that completely focusing on the GPA/rigor of the school, is missing some of those other things that may not be seen as “making a difference” in med-school applications in the same way, but that, based on both observation and a bit of research, are part of most successful candidates’ profiles
For example, I was surprised to hear how difficult it is to get clinical and research experience starting early in the college process at some schools.  Based on my daughter’s experience, I had assumed that finding a lab assistant position within a week of freshman orientation was the rule rather than the exception, but apparently, that’s not true everywhere.  Even things like having those opportunities on campus may be a factor to consider.  Access to key ECs and the opportunities they offer may also vary from school-to-school.
Finding a mentor and developing relationships with faculty is another relevant factor that may be easier at a smaller school or at a school where a student is at the top of the academic heap as well.
And, honestly, finding a school that “fits” and where the student feels they can “stretch comfortably” seems to encourage appropriate course selection and enables the student to take advantage of opportunities when they present themselves.
Med schools are looking for students with high GPAs and MCATs, but my guess is that students who are “on the bubble” in terms of academic preparation are better served by looking for a school where they can maximize their potential rather than one where they think they might be able to get an extra .05 out of the grading system.

"IMHO, finding a premed school is slightly different from just finding a good-fit school without considering premed factors.
All the advices above are really good. With the med school admissions move to competency based admissions, more weight are going to be put on activities outside classroom. If the student is “on the bubble” academically, less time for that student can be put on activities outside classroom. Not to mention the possible anxiety which might come with that uncertainty.
Personally I think “just build confidence as a freshman by taking it easy” is a huge mistake. Students should take a mix of difficult and not-so-difficult courses to test the water. Sooner or later those “difficult” courses are going to come. It is better to know if it is feasible to achieve the above-the-threshold GPA as soon as possible. “On the bubble” is the worst scenario.  Adding a more difficult major like computer science/etc.as a backup probably makes things worse. If the student can’t even handle the premed courses without other hard/time-consuming courses, what are the chances that the students would be able to handle both? Plus different majors have totally different internships.
There is no one-size-fit-all answer to OP’s question. OP is smart enough to think about this. I agree with @Creekland 's statement 100% “When kids from my school are hoping to go to med school and ask for my advice it’s simple. Look for an affordable school you like where you’re in the Top 25% of entering stats”. It is not good to play tennis in a league full of people like Novak Djokovic if one can’t play tennis at that level.
OP should view the course material as its competitor, not its classmates. Yes, at this level, the material is much more advanced. We have reviewed and written some solutions for Orgo exams recently. It is definitely not easy. A high level of understanding of the material is required to answer the questions correctly. (We actually get 2.5 points since we found out TA graded one question wrong — this is the joke … we gained 2.5 points but we weren’t even there.  ) OP should strive to learn the material at a high level in a school at this level. Otherwise, OP should look for other schools with lower standards.

"@Creekland :  I think what I am sort of implying is that most courses that students at elite schools or elsewhere find easy are typically memorization focused because that is something most of us were overly exposed to, especially in life sciences (and even other sciences) curriculum in grade school.  Usually courses that lean more on reasoning and analytical problem solving cause even the highest SAT/ACT scorers trouble because it isn’t enough to simply know the content or knowing every problem type you’ve been exposed to while studying.  Usually such instructors get the “tests us on stuff we didn’t learn” reputation.  To me this is code for: “This instructor surprises students and makes them think about what they learned in a seemingly unfamiliar context or maybe even requires some creativity”.  Most students, including high achievers seem really comfy with neat and predictable and as an educator, you probably know what that may entail in a college classroom or any classroom.
I’ve met many students (I am among them) who are comfortable with courses that involve more conceptual logic and reasoning, but it seems like the vast majority prefer what I described earlier and that makes sense because it is how many of us were trained prior to college (heavily coached and spoonfed material and told exactly what was on a test and how it would be tested).  There is a reason so many students find organic chemistry, for example, an oddball.  Forget it if you integrate lots of reasoning into biology courses.  Unless they are a majority of the bio curric.,at a school, said courses will be avoided like the plague because that isn’t how most people’s biology courses went in high school (they were often just content overload).  I guess I just paint “challenging” as whatever forces most students out of their comfort zone or upsets previous ways of obtaining knowledge/studying.  For most it would be STEM courses with less memorization or with instructors who throw critical thinking oriented “curveballs” as many call it.  It’s why I always relate the two (difficulty and style of assessment and course delivery).  My opinion is that every STEM major should graduate knowing how to use the knowledge or at least understand reasoning in the field, and yes most will enter college with different readiness levels to make that adjustment. You’ll notice that at selective schools, the courses that mostly assess basic understanding and remembering/identifying have 85+ course averages.  One has to go to higher levels of Bloom to get 70 and 60 averages.

"Did a little investigation:  I think Rochester and Emory are decently similar (I think Emory is most similar to WUSTL out of the selective schools.  They just have similar curricula design and ideas clearly) in life sciences and I would expect that math and physics courses that pre-healths/STEM majors have to take would at least be on the same level (I didn’t look:  I usually assume that on average the level of intro. courses in those areas is higher at other schools of similar and higher selectivity because Emory’s depts do not serve an engineering school and nor are they anchored to elite physics and math graduate program/research apparatuses like Chicago for example which is an exception to the engineering rule).
Some differences to consider:
Chemistry;  Emory just changed its chemistry curriculum to bring in a decent amount of organic chemistry into the first year courses (including organic chemistry concepts most often covered in 2nd semester of organic chemistry).  It isn’t a super hardcore introduction, but it is basically blended with traditional gen. chem concepts which you can learn about in these places:
http://chemistry.emory.edu/articulate/chemistry_unbound/story_html5.html
http://news.emory.edu/stories/2017/09/er_chemistry_curriculum/campus.html
These changes may not be well received by some (it is unclear if it is “pre-med friendly” as it kind of bucks traditional two year pre-med engagement with chemistry which is either 2 gen. chems and 2 ochems or 1 gen. chem, 2 ochems, and then biochem.  Emory’s is close to a weird rendition of this latter version) but Emory’s undergraduate chemistry program is known for unusual rigor regardless (even prior to the change).  I saw some of UR’s stuff, and it seems like it would be at the level of a more “standard” level classical general or organic chemistry course at Emory which is/was challenging for many but doable for most.  Admittedly the majority of students take less “classical” instructors once the 3rd (a modern version of organic chemistry) and 4th (supposedly some mixture of material science and biochemical concepts…I am not quite sure and nor does the publication or information above make it clear) pre-health courses are hit
Biosciences:  They look similar, but Rochester is more classical (as in most schools selective or not do it like this) in arrangement.  It has molecular and cell first semester and more organismal biology/ecology second semester.  Emory’s first semester is identical (actually they recently added in ecology/evolution concepts into the first semester and used it to re-frame the molecular cell stuff), and the second semester is basically a genetics course with a primary focus on molecular genetics and modern biotechnology/experimental biology concepts.  I don’t think this difference changes difficulty because OP has AP credit in bio(?  Actually I don’t know) and the AP bio curriculum has apparently changed to integrate more of the stuff Emory covers in its second semester, when it used to be more ecology/evolution heavy back in the dinosaur ages of 2008 when I took it.  I still remember being pleasantly surprised that Emory didn’t just rehash all of that in the second semester and instead hit me with new content. However, current students/prospies will have been exposed to both styles.  What that does mean is that the actual genetics courses look a little different with UR covering the stuff Emory covered in gen. bio and Emory doing something a little different, veering towards human genetics (which means more coverage of epigenetics which we now know  relevant to human diseases now-a-days) and keeping the emphasis more on the experimental aspect as opposed to more math/classical genetics concepts.
Appears Rochester has “recitations” for many intermediate biology classes.  I am unsure how they are used and how the associated lectures are run.  Usually when I think “recitation” I think review and maybe some out of lecture review (which at some schools apparently entails extra lecturing), problem solving, and quizzes, things that maybe the lecture component doesn’t have time for.  Emory doesn’t have these and instead has a big undergraduate TA mentoring and tutoring system which is associated with additional problem sets that are technically optional.  But this mainly applies to lower division courses/pre-med classes.  At the intermediate and advanced level, many biology courses do have “discussion” which is usually for reading and presenting primary literature, but is every so often used for other activities (for example evolutionary biology and math-based upper division courses may integrate a simulation/modelling exercise or something)
As much as it interests me, It shouldn’t  really matter to a prospie(I usually think pedagogy and assessment style usually matter more than arrangement of content for most life sciences courses.  Admittedly chemistry is tricky, but I don’t wanna go there right now).  Students should just get somewhere, learn the material to the highest level possible, and do the best they can. One can get the right type of challenge from Emory, Rochester, and many other places…and even at gasp!  Much less “prestigious” undergraduate programs that have put lots of money into their STEM curricula and pedagogy.  UMD is an example:https://nexus.umbc.edu/  Several of its campus have implemented the NEXUS revamp of life sciences curricula.  I saw some materials resulting from it and they are damned good and are at just as high a level or higher than many “elite” schools, especially those I saw from College Park.  So there are so many schools that one can find that are great for pre-healths because of the resources/opportunities AND because they pay exceptional levels of attention to how they deliver their STEM/pre-health courses.  It is very possible to be in a place that still challenges students in a useful way that isn’t ultra competitive/super duper selective.  You just need to do the research.  One can have several pieces of cake and eat all of them.

True.  It’s kind of sad when high school students looking at premed will post things like, “I want the most rigorous curriculum”.    There are no brownie points for that…and probably they’ll set themselves up for a troubled GPA.
I’m currently helping some premeds who are on gap year…they have troubled or borderline GPAs.  Two both went to tippy top schools (with tippy top high school stats), and both ended up with GPA issues.  Ugh!
Another student also went to a top school, applied with a 3.5 gpa (borderline for unhooked trad) and she thankfully has nabbed an instate acceptance to an unranked SOM…which is totally fine, but certainly wasn’t in her original plan when she chose elite undergrad over midtier where she could have gone for nearly free.  Being from a lucky state helped her, I think.

Also, some years ago, Rochester established a forward-looking policy where they offer a fifth year tuition-free if a student has earned a degree in a focused major (such as engineering) in four years, and wants a chance to broaden his or her education with the electives that couldn’t fit into the schedule. However, their school ranking took a hit by organizations that look at the percentage of students who graduate in four years. I don’t know if that’s still the case.
Upshot: numbers aren’t everything.

I think it’s safe to say that all strong schools, URoch, Emory, Tulane, USC, Tufts, etc, are the “safe” schools for Ivy Hopefuls.  (To be clear, none of those schools are actually safeties).  That’s why they’re all loaded with top students as well.
Reported admission rates to med school are NOT comparable .  Not everyone is using the same measures.  Some are only reporting their MD admissions.  Some are including MD and DO admissions.  Some are also including admissions to foreign med schools.
Virtually all good schools report high acceptance rates for their applicants who have a 3.5+ GPA and a 510+ MCAT.

"Ah the peer argument…  If you look at The Chronicle of Higher Education, they have a graphic that shows who colleges/universities in America labeled as peer institutions.  Emory labeled 13 schools as peers (Brown, Columbia, Duke, Georgetown, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, U of Chicago, U of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, Washington U, and Yale). Only 3 of those schools also listed Emory as a peer institution (Northwestern, Vanderbilt, and Washington U).  All 3 of those schools also list Rochester U as a peer institution (along with all having a higher ranking than Emory by US News and World Report ratings) so Rochester is held in very high esteem (even with a ranking of 33 in the same US News and World Report rankings).  I only know of one student who chose between Emory and Rochester and they chose Rochester, graduated and is currently a 2nd year in Dental School.  I love Emory (I used to live less than 2 miles from the campus for many years and my wife worked at the VA Hospital in the area under an Emory researcher) and it is a great school, but there is no need to knock another great school with great outcomes.  It is really just a matter of preference.

"What doesn’t she like about Cornell?  The weather?  RPI and Case will have similar weather. One great thing about Cornell engineering is that it is 50% female, which is unusual for an engineering school. My D is a freshman MechE major at Cornell and absolutely loves it.  Cornell has so many opportunities to get involved, especially for engineers. She is heavily involved in one of the big project teams, which had given her a great network of friends from all years, as well as real hands-on engineering training.  Cornell has a very strong alumni network as well, especially in the NY area.  I’m an alum myself, and spend a lot of time mentoring recent Cornell grads who want to go into my field. D also looked at RPI but was wary of the lopsided gender ratio, and its extreme tech focus (even the """"liberal arts’ requirements are tech classes).  I don’t know much about VaTech. $30K is a big chunk of money though - only you can decide whether it will be worth it.
Edit -  Is that $30K total or $30K per year?  If that is per year, then that is a much bigger consideration - not sure Cornell is worth $120K more over those other schools.

"If her father isn’t willing to pay then he gets no say.
If he doesn’t pay, can you afford Cornell out of income and savings?
(DO NOT take on parents loans for Cornell just because dad is pushing for it!)
If you can afford Cornell: has she visited? Or does she dislike it because it’s Dad’s alma mater?
If she doesn’t like Cornell, what’s your rationale as to why you’d pay for her to go there?
Case would be a nice compromise - nice urban area, private university, excellent for STEM, variety in class offerings, less skewed m:f ratio than at RPI.
Then again, RPI is a powerhouse in STEM - in case academics matter most to her their focus is clear and strong. (The city it’s in isn’t the best and the m:f ratio is really skewed but the reputation in industry is great).
See if she can do overnights at Vtech and Case. It’ll clear things up: does she prefer a city or a college town, etc.

There are  detailed post grad surveys available  online and VT engineers are very well recruited by many different companies. Of course, Cornell is an excellent choice as well.

"It’s been fun following this thread. I have an incoming Hokie engineer, wait listed at Cornell and a few others, accepted early action for UVA Engineering. Based on family income, it’s possible we could pay less at one of the wait listed schools, but it sounds like Cornell isn’t likely to offer much. And even then, we got great vibes at VT, loved the campus, and kid loves sports (both playing and spectating) and feels the extracurriculars are an especially good fit. Reading the comments from those who’ve had kids at VT, their impressions of the Cornell grind, and positive impressions of the culture compared to other campuses makes me think it’s time to fully commit and stop checking wait list status. Similar to your experience with the Cornell prestige, plenty of people both in and OOS, think we’re nuts for turning down UVA.

He made the 3.0 GPA cut for guaranteed choice of engineering major next year at VT, with room to spare. Your D will not have a problem.
If it’s not too late, she should apply for Hypatia. I was worried that Galileo might be engineering overkill for my S, but he has thoroughly enjoyed it and took advantage of all the opportunities that came with the program. They’re all in it together. Highly recommended.

My brother who graduated from the School of Engineering at UMD many moons back tells me NOT to send S there. He says the drop out rate from engineering is too high and because it is so large S can easily get lost.

Decades ago, many state flagships (probably including Maryland) were not as selective as they are now.  Because engineering curricula were and are rigorous, the washout rate was high back then as many less prepared students decided it was too hard.
But a strong student of the type to earn a full ride merit scholarship is likely to be one who can handle the rigor of an engineering curriculum.

Brother says to send S to CMU where the class size is much smaller and a lot more attention is given from the professors.

How much is your brother offering to contribute?  The decision really belongs to whoever is attending and whoever is paying.

"It may look like he can graduate in three years, but it’s HIGHLY unlikely. Even if he walks in with 25, 30, even 40% of the total credit volume, he’ll have to take certain classes in strict sequence, and some of them will only be offered during specific terms that might not align with his progress.
My son started with quite a few meaningful hours in mechanical engineering. He tested into Calc III, Physics II, and completely out of Chem and several GEs. He printed his curriculum sheet and traced through all of the prerequisites from senior project, backwards through his entire curriculum, to plot the most efficient path. There was no way to cut it below 4 years. He took a couple of light quarters (12 hours) and still only had 15 of 45 quarter hours left his senior year. The problem was, half of them were senior project. He decided to use his time taking graduate classes and will walk with a BS/MS in about 4.5 years.

Students going into CS at a highly selective state flagship or private school known for CS should not be surprised that the popularity of the CS major means large classes.  Even places like Stanford and Harvard (700) and Harvey Mudd (200) have large class sizes for their introductory CS courses.

"I’m a huge fan of Cal. (Alma mater.) I really think it’s one of the most exciting schools/areas you could pick to go to school. I have family members that recently graduated from Cal and had no problem doing it in 4 years. (One was able to graduate a semester early, in fact.)
That said, given the choice between Cal and CMU at a similar price point, I totally see CMU as a rational option.  CMU is a renowned science and tech school that would offer a more personal, personalized education and  likely easier access to faculty and research. Cal is notorious for its bureaucracy and minimal customer service, something frankly you should expect when paying over $50K per year.

Looks like they let the L&S CS major expand to 550 students per year (despite the minimum 3.3 college GPA in the prerequisites for L&S undeclared students to enter the major), to go along with the 300-400 in EECS (which is tightly regulated at the frosh and transfer admission levels).  L&S CS appears to be the second largest major on the UCB campus (economics is larger), a very different situation from the early-to-mid 2000s when the number of students was under 100 per year in the wake of the tech bubble crash.
According to the class schedule, the upper division courses with over 600 students appear to be CS 170 (algorithms) and CS 188 (artificial intelligence).  On the other hand, there does not seem to be much interest in the EE side of EECS, since the upper division EE courses have enrollments under 30.

"$270,000 vs. free. That’s a CMU education or a UMD education and $3,000,000 when he turns 58. That’s the true difference when you consider the opportunity cost of the money ($270,000 at 6% annually for 40 years). Alternatively, it’s $1,500,000 at age 48. It would be a nice bridge between an early retirement and his fully funded 401k at 59.5.
He might get a slightly better experience at CMU, maybe even a superior experience. What he won’t get though is an experience that’s even remotely close to $270,000 more valuable financially. You all have to decide if you are flush enough to provide that as a gift simply based on the experience.
It’s unfortunately too late for this option now for you, but we had a plan for just this case. Not believing ANY undergraduate degree from ANY school is worth a quarter of a million dollars, we simply told our son that any program that netted out over $200k was off the table. The only schools he applied to, in addition to meeting all the requirements that he wanted out of a school, were schools that had reputations of granting good merit aid to high stats students.
Tough choice, but the financial implications are real.

"Are you talking about undergrad or grad school?  I did Wharton undergrad (M&T) and then got my MBA at NYU (part-time while employeed).  For what it’s worth, I definitely felt that the Wharton undergrad classes were more advanced (and harder) than the Stern classes.

"As IBXavier2017 suggested, I’d wait for the Penn offer before deciding anything. Penn is need based so if NYU’s offer was based on need, I wouldn’t be surprised if Penn’s offer was similar in terms of family contribution. If you are keen on pursuing business, I would recommend Wharton.  It is what you do with it but I know I got job interviews based on the Wharton degree. For me there are other factors that would lead me to Penn like coordinated dual degree programs you can do with Wharton undergrad (I was accepted into Wharton and then transferred into M&T) and even though it is an in urban setting, it still have a very campus feel to it.  NYU will pretty much be an all urban setting.

"NYU Stern is the clear choice if the cost difference is $23,000 per year for NYU Stern versus about $69,000 per year for Penn Wharton. The cost difference over 4 years is about $184,000 ($46,000 X 4) plus interest. NYU Stern finance is one of the best undergraduate programs in the world. Lots of internship opportunities.
Earn a NYU Stern degree, work for two to three years, then get an MBA from Wharton, Columbia, Northwestern, Chicago, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Dartmouth, UCal-Bezerkley or even from Duke, Virginia, Michigan and you will be much better off than just having an undergraduate degree from Wharton. Or get a one year specialty masters degree in finance, data science, etc. if that is your career goal.
Do NOT pay sticker price for Wharton when you have a very substantial discount from NYU Stern. If you pay sticker for Wharton in light of your Stern offer, then you should be dismissed from business school, common sense school & anything related.

So NYU + MBA is definitely more expensive, and realistically the Wharton undergrad is more impressive than NYU + MBA in most cases. That said, I would probably just avoid the MBA altogether unless you feel financially comfortable and get into a top program.

"@ccfk1221 It’s probably the biggest decision OP has made in her life to date, so being thorough seems warranted. Stern does very well but Wharton does open a few more doors and generally places better. The difference in placlement is probably not substantial enough to pay $184,000 when it creates a burden for your family. The MBA is interesting because it changes the cost dynamic somewhat. I don’t know the actual numbers (OP could look them up if they care) but if 40% of Stern graduates get an MBA while only 20% of Wharton students do, then there’s a 20% chance that Wharton further saves you around $400k all else equal.
I agree with the above posts though, Stern is the safer path. For certain individuals and certain circumstances it would make more sense to attend Wharton given the edge in placement, MBA necessity, and preference for campus/culture, but it’s dependent on the individual and is a riskier path to take. To be clear, I think In this case Stern seems like the better option unless OP really loves Penn, would consider switching majors potentially, and her parents are able to help with the cost without burdening themselves too much.

MBA scholarships are an entirely different beast. They are used to secure students that they want to add to their class.

Both schools have strong departments in all of your areas of interest.

They are so different that if you figure out your main preferences – things most important to you – you’ll pick the place that presents the better fit.
Key differences – bear in mind that some of these are typical in a U vs. LAC matchup and should not be thought to reflect poorly on Hopkins or Pomona per se:

Pomona will have smaller classes, especially in survey-level courses, and easier access to profs.
JHU offers more majors and classes (compare Pomona's class offerings to see how they compare in terms of breadth -- I'll assume both schools offer the majors you listed above...)
JHU has some D1 sports and far more research opportunities... but also far more competition for coveted research spots.

Hopkins has an urban setting, while Pomona is more small town/suburban.
Weather: four seasons vs. the southern california season.
Hopkins does have a rep for competitiveness, but that is bound to be the case wherever pre-med is so popular. Pomona, by virtue of its less pre-professional vibe (typical of LAC vs. U...), is bound to be less competitive overall. But that doesn't mean the kids majoring in whatever you choose will be more or less competitive at either school.

These are just some of the things you might consider. I would put academic fit first: majors, classes, distribution requirements/curricular style, class sizes, overall vibe if you can get a handle on it, etc. After that, think about the environment/setting and social vibe, dorms, etc.

Of course, you still have the issue that you’d have at all colleges — frosh and soph register later and get slimmer pickings.  But JHU has that, too.
No, I don’t think there is a way around the CS electives issue at Mudd.  It isn’t clear what all the steps are that will be taken to resolve it, and they are working on it, but it is possible that Mudd students might have an edge in getting those courses in the next couple of years.
I don’t have much opinion beyond that.

"I’m a mom and a Pomona alumna. If you’re interested in participating in research, Pomona will provide extraordinary opportunities, and you will be able to work directly with faculty. You might take a look at the faculty bios in your departments of interest to see what you think of the people you’ll be interacting with. If you’re an ideas person who likes to ask and answer questions and be challenged to develop your own theories, Pomona is a good fit. If you feel comfortable with, and are invigorated by the idea of developing a personal rapport with esteemed faculty, Pomona is a good fit. I still visit with my favorite faculty mentor over 20 years later. The cross-registration is indeed a cool feature of the Claremonts. Each school does have its personality and reputation behind it, but all the schools are strong, selective, and well-resourced, so it’s a powerhouse there. There’s one central main library for all the schools, one campus ministry center, one student health/counseling center, one main bookstore, one student newspaper.
Have you visited Claremont? It’s very suburban and not particularly stimulating. You can easily walk to the adjacent “Village” which has a movie theater, coffee shops, and restaurants, and it’s cute and pleasant but nothing that’s really going to ignite any curiosity or provide a lot of opportunities. The surrounding suburbs are even more ho-hum. So there’s really nothing particularly advantageous about the environs there other than it’s a convenient climate that doesn’t impact your life much except for some days in the fall when you will wish you had air conditioning. But if you don’t love Baltimore, then that’s not a real factor I suppose. In my era, Pomona was relatively weak on career development and tended to send many students to either graduate school for PhDs/academia or med school, and the main supported direct placement into full-time jobs was the management consulting route. There were pockets of weak departments and some use of questionable part-time faculty for classes like calculus – but that’s old data so not worth much. All the Claremont schools talk about internship opportunities but be aware that “Los Angeles” is a solid hour by train from Claremont, so this resource has some challenges built in. Pomona places a strong emphasis on diversity and most of the community there are students of color. In that, it feels very similar to southern California as a whole, where there’s no one racial majority.
It’s the most selective liberal arts college in the nation with a huge endowment. Still, most everyday people on the street will not have heard of it, so if you want that nod of recognition when making small talk, Pomona isn’t the one. Having said all these things, I’d choose Pomona again based primarily on one key principle: it’s devoted to undergraduates. I think it makes sense to attend the school that is all about undergrads when an undergrad, then attend a grad school where grad students are a priority. In all, you’re in a great and enviable position – congratulations and good luck!

"I’m the parent of a Pomona rising senior, and I’ll stick up for the village of Claremont as a nice albeit suburban town. Here’s a map. http://www.thevillageclaremont.com/map.html. I’m tagging @nostalgicwisdom for more feedback. I will say that the Pomona CS Department is struggling with the same issues as HMC’s, which is demand that exceeds the amount of faculty available. Basically you have to be a CS major to have the necessary priority to get in classes. They will hold spaces in the introductory classes for the incoming freshmen, but after that you’d better declare a CS major asap.
My D is an Econ major who is trying to complete a CS minor and she was shut out of the class she wanted last Spring semester as a junior. Generally cross-registration is easy and seamless but be aware that for your major some departments will require that you complete certain courses at Pomona (e.g., the Econ department requires that you take the 6 core classes for the major at Pomona). My D is currently doing an internship one of the Federal Reserve Banks. She’s only been there a few days but her boss, a senior Research Economist at the Fed, told her that she is on the “right tail” in terms of the amount of research experience that his interns have had.

All of the fields you are interested in are excellent at Pomona, and a liberal arts college and community can be a particularly stimulating way to explore numerous disciplines and connect readily with people across different interests.
It sounds like your long-term goal is a career within computer science. Here’s a look at the pros and cons of Pomona’s CS at present:
Pros:

The community of students, faculty, and alumni is exceptional. People look out for one another and are encouraging, supportive, and kind. Your feedback is taken seriously and whenever you need help or advising, there is a lot of receptiveness to that.


Prepares you well academically for graduate school. Pomona is one of the top feeder schools on a per capita basis to computer science PhD programs. In fact, many people who are presently at grad school have told me the teaching and individual attention is clearly far above that of the major university they are a part of (in their own classes and in their TA capacities for undergrads there). 
Excellent outcomes. Whether you want to go to a reputable graduate program or top notch industry job, Pomona will help you get there. I've never heard of anyone having difficulty on this regard. The Claremont Colleges are collectively seen as a target school by many tech companies, and ample on-campus recruiting and interviews make it easy to land a job or internship. Many of my friends leave with six figure salaries straight after graduation in many of the famous tech companies. For graduate school, I can't think of anyone who didn't end up at a top 10 program (MIT, Berkeley, Cornell, etc). Pomona is also one of the top schools for students getting STEM fellowships like the NSF, Goldwater, Churchill, etc.
Easy to engage with research and get funding for internships, independent projects, conferences, etc. This is just true for Pomona in general- there is a lot of money and programs designed to help students fund whatever they are passionate about. Harvey Mudd has a 5 college summer computer science research program as well. 

Mixed:

Doing internships in LA. There are a surprising number of tech companies within the metro area, so theoretically, that would enable students to gain other experiences during the year. Most of them are in West LA/Santa Monica, however, which is quite far from Claremont (50 miles or so). Public transportation will take you 2.5 hours each way, so it’s pretty necessary to have a car. But then you have to deal with LA traffic. There are a couple of tech experiences a bit closer- Pasadena, Downtown LA, USC Innovation Lab. Getting to DTLA from Claremont via public transportation is pretty straightforward.

Cons:

Classes are not as small as they are in other departments of the college. Pomona’s average class size is 15, but it is difficult to find a CS class with fewer than 25 students. That said, almost none tend to be over 50 either, and even in larger classes professors take the time to know the students individually.


Lots of interest, but not the most ideal set-up to accommodate it. Getting into CS classes is tough if you're a non-major (they advise students to declare immediately upon arriving). If you're a CS major, you'll definitely have priority in order to graduate with the degree within four years, but many popular electives can be locked out. Pomona did just hire 2 more full time faculty, so hopefully that helps a bit. Mudd is presently in their own crisis for CS and honestly, there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen. I think you can count on Mudd if you want to do research with a professor there, but if you want to get into a specific course, it's probably going to be a lottery (for them and for us). 
The emphasis is pretty theoretical and isn't the sort of pre-professional, project based work that you would want to present to someone in the industry. Students and liaisons step in to cover that aspect (hackathons, student led teaching, collaborative service-based projects, etc), but the department itself is very academic. One way to alleviate this is to do Harvey Mudd's Computer Science Clinic, in which you do an industry-based project as your senior thesis. It's open to CS students regardless of home school. Most students will intern in their summers while doing research during the school year at Pomona, allowing them to be prepared both for academia and for the industry. 
Smaller course selection within CS- at the end of the day, most of your experiences will be coming from Pomona, and it's a small school with just 1600 students and 240 professors in total. 

===
You mentioned Johns Hopkins’s stronger alumni network. I have a close friend at JHU, and that’s actually one of her biggest complaints with the school. She said that it can be difficult as an undergrad to benefit from alumni experiences. All of the various constituent colleges like Bloomberg, Med School, etc. have independent identities. I think what you’re referring to is that JHU is a larger school, so the alumni reach is much bigger. But in terms of actually connecting to alums and being advised from them, I feel like a small LAC like Pomona fosters a special dynamic to give back. Forbes says that 31% of Pomona grads donate, ranking it #25 for “Most Grateful Grads”, while JHU is 13% and ranks #48. I’ve seen a lot of my CS classmates come back to Pomona to seek out interns for the companies they’re working at, and there’s also a larger network of 5C alums eager to support one another! So you’re not only looking at people from Pomona, but from Mudd, Scripps, Pitzer, and CMC as well who you can reach out to.
That said, JHU is definitely more well-known, and is a world-class research university. I believe their philosophy department was just given a $75 million dollar gift. And it seems you’ve identified specific facilities that excite you. So I can see the dilemma.
Obviously, I’d pick Pomona, but I’m biased. But I think if you’re confident about graduate school, Pomona can help launch you to the best ones out there (and the top facilities involved with them) while giving you a transformative, once in a lifetime liberal arts college experience. Pomona is known for its rigorous academics coupled with a high quality of life & happy students. The Claremont Colleges really enrich the experience and help the school feel larger and more exciting. I’m looking at a website of ratings based on student reviews, and out of 10 (the maximum):
Johns Hopkins vs Pomona-
Education Quality: 8.4 vs 8.8
Individual Focus: 6.6 vs 9.1
Collaboration: 6.6 vs 8.9
Friendliness: 7.4 vs 9.2
Faculty Accessibility: 7.3 vs 9.3
Social Life: 6.0 vs 7.5
Scholastic Success: 7.7 vs 8.9
Extracurricular Activities: 7.0 vs 8.0
University Resources: 7.3 vs 8.5
On another website:
Overall Experience at Pomona- 4.65/5
Overall Experience at Johns Hopkins- 4.04/5
It seems that students are more content at Pomona 
Good luck with your decision- there are pros and cons to both. They’re almost opposites of each other to an extent, but you’re sure to have a great experience either way!

"@Drawcodawn I would reach out to some JHU faculty and CS majors for more data points - especially on their facebook groups, reddit, and via e-mail.  You will be surprised at the response.
JHU does have more lay and professional name recognition than Pomona at the professional level which will help if you do not choose to go to grad school.  It also helps that all of the FANG companies recruit on campus for JHU - not sure if the same is true for Pomona (doubtful).  JHU’s comp sci major is also world renowned (especially for cyber security) and small which helps tremendously.  It doesn’t help that Pomona’s CS program is not even ABET accredited let alone recognized.
To say JHU’s reputation is primarily medical is a bit shortsighted.  JHU is well known in silicon valley - far more from my subjective experience versus any LAC given none of them having an engineering school save for Mudd (which is also a relative unknown).  It helps that JHU’s ex-president is heavily involved in the community and Stanford (Will Brody).  And it doesn’t hurt that IBM’s ex ceo and chairman of the board (Samuel J. Palmisano) is a JHU alum.
Contrary to @nostalgicwisdom  Go to US News and compare JHU to Pomona:
Alumni giving rank: #6 amongst all universities (37.5%) vs Pomona (27.6%) 54th amongst all LACs.
Academic Reputation: JHU (4.6) Top 5 amongst all universities versus 4.4 for Pomona - top 20 amongst LACs.
Disclaimer:  Former JHU undergrad alum and MIT grad alum working at Google now in Mountain View.  I would choose JHU in a heartbeat and it also helps they wanted you first.  If you tell people in the valley you majored at Comp Sci at Pomona, a non-insignificant amount would have assumed you went to Calpoly Pomona since the latter actually has an engineering school.  No need to make that distinction with Hopkins.
As for the network, yes it exists.  I and several other JHU grads have referred fellow JHU alums to Google.  We have an SF JHU young alumni chapter that takes care of other alums for tech jobs too.
Pomona isn’t even the top ranked LAC in US News and it does not compare to Hopkins from a CS level.

"No, but a lot of my close friends are, and I’m part of the Facebook CS community. I was a science major in another department, so I can speak about research at Pomona.
It’s easy to get involved- you can start from the moment you arrive on campus! I started in the second semester of my first year. The intro courses do a good job connecting you with the department so you can learn about each professor’s research interests and see where you want to build experience. You mentioned an interest in AI, so here’s a perspective from a recent grad to see her CS experiences both in and outside Pomona: http://www.pomona.edu/news/2018/03/22-chinasa-okolo-%E2%80%9918-coding-more-inclusive-computer-science
During the school year, you do research as a course- in your case, either CS199RAPO (Research Assistantship) or CS199IRPO (Independent Research). I believe there are some funds available for students who need work-study money as well. These are courses you create which are advised by a professor. Grad schools love these because it shows independence and direct research involvement. There’s also a game lab at CGU: http://www.cgu.edu/center/claremont-game-lab/
Most upper-division labs at Pomona are structured to involve an independent research project. The work I did in two of my labs (required courses at Pomona!) was presented in research conferences, and one was turned into a paper.
During the summer, there are three opportunities you can use. Summer Undergrad Research Program, SURP, pays $440 per week and funds about ~200 students to engage with research with professors on-campus. An additional 30-50 projects are funded for off-campus unpaid research opportunities or independent proposals. Pomona College Summer Experience Funding (SEF) is done through the Career Development Office and funds unpaid or low-paying internships (you come up with the budget); I benefited from that to do research at a major university. Harvey Mudd sponsors a 5C summer research program in CS which sponsors 70 students for research: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/research/ This isn’t as difficult to benefit from as it sounds, since the vast majority of CS students across the colleges do an internship over the summer rather than staying on campus.
Thesis is optional for CS at Pomona, but highly encouraged if you want to go to grad school. You can do an academic thesis (with independent research) advised by a CS professor at either Pomona or Mudd- there’s an agreement between the two schools to combine professor expertise in order to manage thesis led research proposals. As seen above, Chinasa did her senior project with a Pomona professor. The alternative is Clinic, in which you are given an industry project by a company and work in teams to come up with solutions/insights. You can learn more about Clinic here (http://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/info) and see specific projects here (https://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/projects/).

At google, it is extremely difficult to break into deep mind unless you have graduate schooling or prior AI knowledge which is just simply not provided at the undergrad level.  This is not even taking account changes such as blockchain that is being introduced more at the grad level as well.  So exposure in this category will deepen your expertise and will be helpful in getting you to the right group within google AI or FAIR (Facebook’s AI group) should you choose that path.
As for cutthroat competition, it is a myth and frequent rumor mill spread by people who did not get in or go tot hopkins.  People study together.  When you go to the library or dorms, you will frequently find study groups. They compete together against the tests and not against each other since the school does not have grade inflation.  When you ask the source of these cutthroat rumors, they are time and time again by non Hopkins alums.  This goes for the premeds as well.  Ask current Hopkins students if it is cut throat there before passing judgement.
I personally had a blast and met my best friends at Hopkins.  We had a great time partying, hanging out in fells point close to the harbor, going to DC, chilling at federal hill and around mount Vernon in Baltimore as well.

Does ABET accreditation matter in CS? I don’t believe LACs without engineering are even eligible to apply, since ABET is an engineering based institution. As mentioned, the CS outcomes from Pomona are phenomenal, with students readily landing tech jobs at the top companies and graduate school destinations. If there’s some evidence that Pomona CS students are suffering in comparison to students from other schools, I’d like to see it. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Alphabet all recruit across the 5Cs, and while I don’t believe Netflix does, I just found 10 Pomona alumni who are presently working there and 7 at Mudd through LinkedIn. I could easily reach out to them. Tech recruiting is not something that the CCs are weak at. And as previously mentioned, I’ve never heard of anyone from Pomona complaining that their education did not serve them well for grad school.


I was referring to this: http://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2017/08/02/2017-grateful-grads-index-top-200-best-loved-colleges/


It’s silly to discount Pomona as “isn’t even the top ranked LAC in US News”. Johns Hopkins “isn’t even the top ranked university in US News”, so don’t bother with them. Doesn’t that sound absurd? If we’re going by rankings that actually are combined, Forbes ranks Pomona 10th (including the #1 LAC) and Hopkins 30th, while Times/WSJ rates Pomona 26th and Hopkins 17th. That’s hardly any different.


I can tell you that people constantly turn down Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, U of M, and yes, Harvey Mudd, alongside other distinguished CS programs to come to Pomona. Ask the CS majors at Pomona what other schools they were considering, and you’d be surprised. There is no denying the research powerhouse strength of Johns Hopkins and its name brand, as well as the fact it has a larger, more resourced (not necessarily BETTER- in terms of quality of teaching, undergrad focus, community, etc) department. This is a classic case of small LAC vs. big university, and there are genuine reasons for picking the former without resulting in anything significant to one’s potential outcomes. LinkedIn Career Insights lists the six most similar schools to Pomona as Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford, Brown, Yale, and UChicago. It may not have the same name brand as Hopkins, but at least in the USA, the people who recruit and read applications hold it to high esteem. For graduate school, it has a track record of sending students to distinguished programs. I can’t speak about the Bay, but I have experience with the east coast and found Pomona to be largely recognized.
The advice about connecting with students and alumni directly is good, though. It would be good to get some perspective from undergrads at either schools to better understand the strength and weaknesses of each program, as well as alumni about how their school prepared them.

[/quote]

ABET accreditation does set a good minimum standard, but there exist good CS majors that are not ABET accredited (e.g. Stanford, CMU, UCB L&S CS).  In many cases, good CS majors do not have ABET accreditation because they do not have the non-CS science requirements needed for ABET accreditation.
What it does mean is that one may have to more carefully evaluate the actual CS offerings at a school where CS does not have ABET accreditation.  But it does not automatically mean that the CS major there is unsuitable.

Does ABET accreditation matter in CS? I don’t believe LACs without engineering are even eligible to apply, since ABET is an engineering based institution.
[/quote]

There are schools whose only ABET accredited program is CS.
But it is likely that many schools do not bother because (a) it is not perceived as required like it is for (for example) civil engineering, (b) they do not require non-CS science for CS majors, and/or © they do not want to deal with the administrative work involved.

It seems like you’ve gotten a lot of perspective from people (I saw topics on other websites as well), though I will say a lot of it is JHU focused simply by nature of them being a much larger school. I could see a lot of misconceptions regarding Pomona with the perspectives detailed (including the one above), but at this point I don’t really find it worthwhile to “dispute” points raised. If anything, they can give you a sense for what colleagues and friends might perceive a degree from a top LAC to mean, whether or not that’s grounded in anything true. If the opinions of others is something which especially matters to you, and you want to impress others with your institution, then there is the appeal of Johns Hopkins which is widely renowned as a leading university. I will be honest with you that Pomona will not give you much in the way of immediate glamour, and not everyone can tolerate that. But as a recent graduate, I know I was able to have the best undergraduate experience there and can stand on my own accomplishments and perspectives rather than the public worth of my institution alone.
No point in overthinking this. Small LAC with the individual attention and undergrad-centered experiences, or big university with world-class professors and research? They are vastly different. Enough has been elaborated at this point regarding the pros and cons of either. One will clearly resonate with you more than the other. Good luck with your choice, and once you’ve made it, move on to imagining the excitement and possibility you’ll have as an incoming first year at either!

@Drawcodawn, are you already familiar with JHU’s Human Language Technology COE?

Have you investigated opportunities for undergrads in this center?
Have you checked out ~related internship opportunities with firms/agencies in the Baltimore Washington corridor?
IMO they are both fine schools; one could make a good case for either one.
For your specific areas of interest, I would think JHU offers greater breadth/depth.
Maybe this should be a key consideration (more than prestige or name-recognition, which are high for both schools). However, if I weren’t satisfied that good opportunities extend to undergrads at JHU, I’d probably prefer the Pomona/Claremont environment. Have you contacted JHU departments/programs about how undergrads participate, what they’re doing after graduation, etc.?

"2021 is a bad year to compare given the concordance issues with the new SAT and old SAT (also, Pomona’s CDS states 1370-1540, not 1330-1520).
If those numbers are accurate for Hopkins (they seem higher than what the admitted profile reports, which is usually not the case, but theoretically it is possible), then they’ve deliberately shifted their admissions process to be more numbers driven. Those numbers would be at or above what schools like Stanford, Harvard, and Yale reported this year.  At least from 2014-2016, JHU was ranked around 20 or so for entering student testing (one source here: http://www.businessinsider.com/the-50-smartest-colleges-in-america-2016-10) so going to top 5 or so is a big shift.
Pomona’s numbers have actually come down slightly despite more and more applicants, and I think it’s due to the opposite effect. They’ve cut down on a numbers driven process (at one point, Pomona was ranked 5th in the nation for highest entering student stats) in pursuit of a holistic one, though they still want top students (hence the high % ranked in the top 10%). Pomona has had the highest percent of underrepresented minority students of any highly ranked LAC or university for the past two years, alongside their commitment to socioeconomic diversity (top 10 by a ranking in NYTimes and one of only three private colleges to be there; JHU ranked 72), first-gen students, rural representation, QuestBridge, two cohorts of Posse, and other community-based partnerships.
Furthermore, compare what each admissions website has to say:
JHU: https://apply.jhu.edu/application-process/
We’re looking for students who can think beyond their limits, who don’t see ‘impossible’ as a roadblock, and who will not only elevate themselves, but also those around them.
Pomona: https://www.pomona.edu/admissions/apply
Evidence of:
Investment and involvement in a community or passionate pursuit
A love for learning, and a willingness to challenge yourself and go outside your “comfort zone”
An openness to new ideas and rejection of easy answers
An appreciation for a collaborative learning environment
Personal character — be it grit, kindness, diligence or serving others
Risk-taking and adventurousness
Creativity and innovation
Appreciation for the visual and/or performing arts
Is one harder to get into? I feel like a high stats student with good ECs and clear ambition could potentially count on getting into JHU in a way they can’t at Pomona. OTOH, the students scoring the 30 or below at Pomona might not be able to get into JHU.
I don’t think this is too important to a decision making process in particular, but I do find it intriguing that the schools look for different things. JHU really seems to stress challenging one self and seeking to be the best you can be. Pomona has more of the liberal arts character. It can be a good reflection of the sort of students who attend either one.

"Also, speaking of the quora link, the common story I see is that the name brand isn’t super great outside of academia but people are still able to get to top destinations for both careers and grad school, so one shouldn’t worry too much.

With one exception, and I mean, he’s entitled to his view, but that doesn’t mean he’s correct regarding outcomes (at least for the present- he’s a 2005 grad). Since he referenced Amherst and Williams in specific, there are data points from the three schools showing that the salaries across these schools are similar (CollegeScoreCard & PayScale), that tech/consulting/other prestigious gigs recruit similarly from the Claremont Colleges, and that Pomona is similar in terms of students receiving competitive fellowships or getting a PhD. Maybe back in 2005 Pomona truly did suffer when it came to pre-professional opportunities, recruiting, and such, but that hasn’t been my personal experience as a 2016 grad. I know Pomona definitely stepped up for funding internships and elevating career services in the four years I was there. I actually landed a couple of interviews in NYC where the employers spoke highly of the school, so it’s on the rise.

Doing well at Pomona or JHU will not guarantee a top grad program.  There are other factors at play in terms of getting into grad school.  But I can tell you that the number one grad school destination for JHU (outside of JHU) for last year’s graduating class was Harvard.  I went to MIT from Hopkins on a full fellowship (amongst the top 10% of entering grad students as did some of my other classmates).  Many of my other classmates across the engineering school also won extremely competitive national fellowships (NDSEG, NSFGRFP, Hertz) or individual full school sponsored fellowships at Princeton (Gordon Wu Fellow), Stanford (SGF program) and Harvard.  You will have no shortage of opportunities at JHU.  I graduated from JHU in 2015, so my experience is also recent.

It also helps that the reputation of JHU in silicon valley is absolutely sterling - it is where you want to be if you want to be in tech.  What is not debatable is the fact that more employers will have heard of and recognize JHU here versus Pomona given JHU’s CS program is actually known.
@nostalgicwisdom JHU has had high stats for a while now.  It’s just been slowly going up over the years from the above 1360-1530.  Business Insider is likely using outdated data.

The factors for getting into a top graduate school with funding are research experience (first author publications help especially) and recommendations by notable professors. You will have no shortage of this at JHU with ample summer funding (see PURA and other funded research programs with JHU professors).  Test scores and GPA are next in importance.

Brown only gives grades of A, B and C with no A- or B+, etc. so if a student doesn’t get a 4.0 in the class, the next possible grade is a 3.0. So some students who are not getting As and in some cases, even Bs, will drop a class at the end of the semester rather than taking a grade that will substantially lower their GPA. Brown also does not give Ds and Fs. Any grade lower than a C and it’s as if the class never existed on your transcript.
The A-B-C grade system also sometimes result in the cutoff for an A being a little more generous than at a school where the next lowest grade is a 3.7 rather than a 3.0. but, there is a degree of grade deflation as well when the student with a 3.6-3.7 average in the class gets a B/3.0 as a final grade.
GPA inflation is not the same thing as grade inflation in individual classes.  The quality and quantity of work that is required to get an A in a class at Brown is not at some lower level than its peer schools. Like many peer schools,   most classes  at Brown don’t have a bell curve distribution for assigning grades, so if 60% of the students do A level work then 60% of the students will get As.  But students shouldn’t choose Brown thinking  it’s going to be a lot easier to get an A than somewhere else.

All those reasons (the super lenient drop deadline, amount of pass/fail coursework allowed, no grade lower than a C showing up on your transcript, high percentage of As for classes, etc.) are exactly why I said that grade inflation exists at Brown.  GPA inflation IS grade inflation (in fact, studies of grade inflation often use GPA distributions to measure grade inflation, or percentage of As - both of which is high at Brown).
Brown and Duke have the same quality of student - yet Duke students have a harder time getting As and higher GPAs.
The OP ought to be aware of this to make an educated decision.  In some situations, such as Law School admissions, where GPA heavily influences admissions and the school attended is not sufficiently used to put GPAs in context, a school like Brown might be a strategic choice.

Highly selective undergraduate recruiting also benefits the Ivy Leaguer.
But after that first job or the professional school admittance - the advantages dissipate. There  is loads of research on the pay gap initially enjoyed by the ivy level grad disappeaing over time. It soon becomes more about the indiovud than the college advantage.
I also think the Princeton grad has the advantage when there is a virtual tie for a promotion or  when competing for a position.  But as Marilyn Monroe. stated.   “Looks are great but after two minutes you’re on your own”.  Such is life and such is the ug presitige advantage.

The golden touch is possessed not by the Ivy League College, but by its students.’”

Also, applications of entrepreneurship extend beyond the startup world.  I find it interesting that you mentioned startups.  One of the most important players in the startup world are VC/PE (Venture Capital/Private Equity) firms and Investment Banks (who handle M&A, IPOs, underwriting, etc.).  These firms care a lot about GPA for the limited undergrad recruitment they do.  Financing (both buy-side and sell-side) play a huge role in the startup world and the OP’s son may be interesting in pursuing that as someone studying Econ.

It depends on major and your personal preferences.

Meaning smart classmates. Large and growing endowment. New buildings and investment in infrastructure. Brand new field house with beautiful gym, pools and dance rooms for students. The brand new Schiller integrated sciences center which will be cutting edge in cross disciplinary research. New school of engineering adding to science chops. Excellent pre health consulting.

"It definitely comes down to your preferences and vibe. BU has an urban campus connected to the city (albeit a pretty self contained one confined to a stretch of Commonwealth Ave), whereas BC has a traditional (and very beautiful) collegiate campus ~30 minutes out by public transit.
Acknowledging the limits of stereotypes, BU kids are typically seen as trendier and more individualistic, whereas BC kids maintain a preppier, more mainstream image. BU students interact more with local schools, particularly MIT, than do BC kids by virtue of proximity.
Contrary to the previous post, I would say BU has made proportionally far greater strides in selectivity than BC; BC has been top-notch for some time, while BU just recently caught up to a similar standard of selectivity. The incoming GPAs and standardized test scores are nearly identical, and BU has a ~6 percentage point lower acceptance rate likely because it draws from a comparitively more extensive international applicant pool. Considering BU’s momentum relative BC, BU will likely make up the 5 spot difference in US News rankings and leapfrog BC by the time you graduate - if rankings are important to you / employers in your prospective field.
BC and BU have a similar endowment (~2 bil), but BU shares that amongst roughly twice the student population.
BU’s Kilachand center (CILSE) has the same focus on interdisciplinarity, and it was endowed with $100 million dollars by a donation last year that will mean it will dependably pump out ~$5 million in research per year at minimum. BU conducted $400 million in research last year, and BC conducted $193 million. Overall, BU typically carries more weight in the sciences.

[/quote]

The best-known college-rankings, from USN&WR, include an evaluation of “student selectivity” (among other things). And as far as USN&WR is concerned, acceptance rate is only a minor factor in determining selectivity. They evaluate selectivity using the following factors:
65% weight - SAT or ACT scores for enrolled (not admitted) students
25% weight - fraction of enrolled (not admitted) students in top 10% of their high school class
10% weight - acceptance rate
In other words, “selectivity” is not really determined by the number of students that a school turns away. Instead, it’s mostly determined by the quality of the students that a school attracts.
In the 2018 ranking, BC was ranked #28 for selectivity specifically, while BU was ranked #45. Note that these are just the ranks for selectivity, which is only one component of the overall ranking. BU ranked higher than BC in other components, like “faculty resources”, and so the overall rankings were closer.
So there is a good case that BC is the more “selective” school. However, it would be foolish to choose BC over BU solely on that basis.

"I agree on admit rates not being a great indicator of selectivity.  The modern phenomenon of low admit rates is largely due to the relative ease of applying to multiple schools combined with marketing programs to get as many to apply or not whether or not they are qualified.  A cynical view would be to say they are inducing unqualified students to apply to be rejected.  The number of high stat kids has not skyrocketed (although high school grade inflation is rampant).  Unfortunately, other metrics used by USNews are open to manipulation as well.
I would say historically, BC has had the better reputation and a more traditional campus experience.  BU has made some significant gains and is experiencing some of the trendiness that some urban campuses are experiencing.  It is difficult to say if that is going to continue or whether trends will change.

Parents need to be able/willing/ready to pay to make it happen.

"@Momof2022 - What does your son/daughter want? What criteria did you give him/her when applying to schools in terms of what you were willing/able to contribute? What are her social/intellectual/academic wants and needs?
Yes, conventional CC wisdom will tell you to take the money from USC and run. But conventional wisdom doesn’t always provide right answers in every case.
My daughter had to make the same choice last year: she was offered full tuition scholarships at USC, Vandy, and Wash U (and others) and had also gotten into HYPS and UChicago (UChicago gave a decent merit and FA combination; HYPS gave very little FA (under 10K) and, of course, no merit.
The most important criterion my D had was that she wanted to be around really, really bright kids. Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.
USC was not a good fit for my D, despite thinking that it had some interesting programs and seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her – she would NOT have been happy there). Among her full tuition scholarship options, she liked Wash U. the best.
My D, with our unwavering support, chose Stanford and could NOT be happier. To us, it is worth every penny.
That said, she is our only child, so we don’t have any more tuitions to pay. We drive old cars and don’t take lavish vacations. My D is not seeking an education as a means to an end – the only return on investment she seeks (and that we hope for her) is greater knowledge. She will likely end up in a PhD program in the humanities. She loves what she is studying, has had some absolutely amazing and supportive professors, enjoys her fellow students, and finally feels like she has intellectual peers (something she did not have in HS).
She has truly found her tribe there and is absolutely, positively 100% certain that she made the right choice. My DH and I are too.

My sister went to Miami of Ohio, which was one of the original “Public Ivies.” My mother never lost an opportunity to mention that to friends and relatives. Now so many schools are tagged, “Public Ivy”, usually by alumni and parents of alumni, that the term doesn’t mean much anymore.

Yes, some USC grads do go on to get PhDs, but a far smaller proportion of the student body than at HYPSM or the U of C.
And yes, it’s an overgeneralization, but I think you’d find that a significantly smaller portion of the USC student body go there mainly or solely for the pursuit of knowledge.

"In terms of schools having an “intellectual student body”.
At many no-name high schools all over the country, the seniors most likely to get into Harvard and Stanford are the recruited athletes.  Are they smart?  Sure.  Are they intellectual?  Maybe or maybe not, but that has nothing to do with why they would get in and many smarter and more intellectual students would not.   Often the middle class intellectual students are those who decide to take a merit scholarship.   They are overlooked by the Ivies because being an intellectual does not necessarily translate into an outstanding college application.
Some, like LoveTheBard’s daughter, are so brilliant they easily stand out and are admitted to those schools.  Most don’t stand out nearly as much as the wealthy student from the connected private schools who regularly send a significant number of students to those schools.
“Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.”
It’s a bit like the blind men touching one part of the elephant and being certain of its shape based on the part they touched.
A family member went to Stanford and it is not “intellectual”.  It has many students who ARE intellectual and it has  students who are not and are very career focused.  As does Harvard.  As does U. Chicago.  As do Wash U., Duke and USC.  A student can choose to seek them out or not.
Making a difference doesn’t always mean starting a foundation with your family’s money or the connections they have to help you start it. It doesn’t mean developing an app that someone will pay you millions to buy. Making a difference may be those “dull” serious students working hard for As to get into medical school and be the doctors who save lives.  Making a difference may be those “dull” scientists sitting in their labs examining some tiny aspect of mitochondria that will eventually lead to a cure for some disease.

"@USCWolverine - In answer to your question, no, I did not say that “USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body.” What I said was “USC was not a good fit for my D, despite her thinking that it had some interesting programs and that it seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her – she would NOT have been happy there).” She felt this more socially than academically; immediately after visiting USC, she went to Grinnell (another school that offered her full tuition) which she thought would be a better social – but not as good of an academic (their art history programs were not as interesting to her) – fit.
Of course USC has many, many bright and intellectually curious kids. And Stanford has no shortage of kids that are not the least bit intellectually curious. But the level of discussion in the classrooms and the level of intellectual engagement she experienced was, in the aggregate, qualitatively different among kids at Yale, Stanford, and U Chicago that they were at schools like Vanderbilt, USC, Wash U., etc. (And I agree, getting an overall feel for a school is a bit like blind men poking at an elephant and oftentimes one sees what one wants to see.) Ultimately, for my daughter, it was a matter of not wanting to be a big fish in a smaller pond; she wanted a bigger pond in which to swim.
(And yes, UChicago was a definite contender but she didn’t want the weather; Yale was initially her top choice until she got to New Haven and hated it; she thought about Reed, but ultimately decided not to apply because they did not offer any merit aid (the only non-HYPS schools she applied to were those that offered significant merit aid and she submitted separate scholarship applications to any school that required them). She would have been all over Deep Springs had they been accepting applications from women last year.
And as @rickle1 points out, there is a “Big difference between “should I pay vs. could I pay?” If you’re fortunate enough to be in the “Should I pay” group, really think about the “why”. If it’s meaningful, pay, if not, don’t.” It seems that OP is in that group. And @MYOS1634 is quite correct, there are plenty of families that are tempted to pull the rug out from their kids’ feet when faced with this type of decision.
My daughter was very, very concerned about the finances and she is very well aware that money that is spent on her undergraduate tuition is money that might otherwise be used for other things (e.g., putting a down payment on a home or investing in stocks). In creating her list, we encouraged her to cast a wide net among in-state publics (UCs), LACs and research universities that offered merit aid, and HYPS, etc. and that we would consider her options when we had the results.
Every situation and every family is different. I’m just adding another data point and another point of view.

I will assume that this is a USC with full tuition scholarship versus full pay for Stanford thread in which cost is not a major factor.
[/quote]

Since the title of the thread mentions that some schools are tuition-free while others are full-cost, I had the impression that money was an issue.

"@simba9 - My D is in an intensive humanities living/learning core program (a sort of Western – and some Eastern – Civilization course) at Stanford. During the first quarter, there were no shortage of conversations that, while perhaps not at the level of Plato’s Dialogues, certainly concerned themselves with Plato’s Dialogues. Discussions spilled out of the classroom and into the dining hall and later into the lounge. They’ve since moved well past Plato and Aristotle and more recent discussions are about Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Marx and W. E. B. Du Bois.
There are no right or wrong answers to the choice between taking a full-tuition scholarship at USC versus being full pay at Stanford, and it is completely dependent upon a variety of other factors involving all aspects of fit – academic, social, intellectual, and economic.

"@LoveTheBard I gather you are talking about SLE (Structured Liberal Education), which they have had at Stanford for a long time (even when I attended).  That experience is probably different from that of most students at Stanford, but it’s limited to 90 students a year.  Also, because they live in a separate dorm, they are somewhat isolated from other students, and I don’t think I ever interacted with anyone from SLE.
When I attended, students were required to take a year-long course in Western Civilization, which was intended to be equivalent to the Great Books curriculum at UChicago and Columbia, and which was supposed to stimulate common discussion among students on a shared reading list.  But we had 9 or so different tracks for Western Civ, each sponsored by a different department, such as history or science and technology, so we never really all read the same set of books.  Anyway, Stanford eliminated its Western Civ requirement 30 years ago, due in part to student pressure, so aside from SLE, there hasn’t been a common core experience at Stanford in a long time.
Stanford has long had a cultural divide between those who major in STEM subjects and those who major in the humanities and social sciences.  Back then, they called each other “techies” and “fuzzies”, and apparently, those terms are still in use today.  See, for example, this recent commentary from the Stanford Daily about the phenomenon:

"Congrats to your son on his tremendous accomplishments. Some have referenced the USC scholarship as a golden ticket, but those other admission offers must feel like golden tickets too. Walking away from the Ivy offers of admission is going to be understandably hard. We are in a somewhat similar situation where the first choice school was very clear when costs were equal, but a last minute full academic scholarship at #2 makes the choice more difficult.  In our case, the cost differential is much smaller (maybe about 60-70k) but once you “see” that cost savings it is very hard to “unsee” it.   Best of luck with the decision.

"@mdphd92 - Yes, I was referring to SLE and yes, it’s been around forever (the parents of one of the students is SLE this year met at SLE during their freshman year over a quarter of a century ago).
As for the techie/fuzzy divide, my D is far less apologetic about her choice of study than the author of that article. She has no “shame… about being a fuzzy” nor “insecurity about pursuing an uncommon path…” She embraces her choices wholeheartedly and is passionate about what she is studying.
It is indeed the case that STEM fields reign supreme at many colleges and universities these days. Humanities and the arts often get short shrift in a society where “return on investment” and job placement seem to be among the most important factors in choosing an institute of higher learning. (Most of the posts on this thread concern themselves with this very issue). It is also the case that those who choose to study the humanities at Stanford can have all of the faculty support and resources they need.
I see Stanford as ahead of the curve on this – while other schools are scrambling to shore up their STEM programs, Stanford has been investing some real money into its arts and humanities programs over the course of the last decade.
Oh, as to the question “What came first, the fuzzy or the techie?” My answer is “Neither.” Back in Leonardo’s day, science and art were not seen in such mutually exclusive terms; he is celebrated as much for his scientific genius as he was for his artistic genius.
And, @USCWolverine – just because USC was not a good fit for my D, who happened to be seeking an intellectual vibe, does not mean that there aren’t a great number of highly intellectual students and faculty there and that it isn’t a fabulous school. It just wasn’t the “golden ticket” for my daughter.

Well things do not go as planned.  He decided he wanted to pursue dance (together with bio) so now USC dance program became his #1 choice. Like film school, it’s extremely hard to get in.  He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super “intellectual” kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC’s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.  We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.  Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship.

I have a few friends doing polisci and are interning at various congressional offices so if you’re looking to go into politics Washu is a great place for that. If your plan after undergrad is to go into grad school, Washu is also very good as Washu has really great name recognition in academia and I have heard good things about grad school placements from all majors.

"My S graduated from Bowdoin. We used to live in the Midwest and had also toured WashU. Both are wonderful schools and you are fortunate to have such great choices.
Bowdoin is small, and was smaller than my S’s high school, but my S loved it there and made great friends he still keeps in contact with and gets together with.
The town of Brunswick isn’t what I would call “rural” but is a nice little college town. There is a train station and it’s easy to get to Boston. As far as transportation, the closest airport is Portland. When my S was coming back from breaks, he usually found other Bowdoin students to share a taxi with. Since he graduated, there’s a new Metro Bus that connects Portland to Brunswick.
St. Louis is obviously a different kind of place - the metro area is over 2 million. You can take the light rail commuter train from the airport to the campus. The WashU campus is very nice.
Both schools rank very highly for campus food.
Two of my S’s former roommates are in graduate school at UCLA and Harvard, so if your future plan is graduate school, I think either place would prepare you well.

"@reindeercoffee  Congratulations on your acceptances - there is no bad choice here.
My daughter considered both schools, we toured both, and she liked both for different reasons.  Here are my impressions:
Both places have smart, qualified, motivated students and strong faculty so there’s no bad choice on the academics.  Wash U is larger so there are more faculty and more courses available.  I don’t know about the Poli Sci department at Bowdoin but the one at Wash U has an excellent reputation.  Humanities overall are good quality - it’s much more than a pre-med program.
Wash U felt somewhat more pre-professional and applied than Bowdoin.  This is a matter of degree, not an absolute.
Bowdoin’s student body feels quite preppy and sporty, although Bowdoin also cares about diversity - being an early adopter of test-optional admissions reflects that commitment.
Wash U has a LOT of Asian and Asian-American students, which may be a plus for you.
Food is fantastic at both (at least by Western standards).
Hookup culture - you will find it anywhere.  And you will find students that are more geared towards serious relationships.  And you will find students that have yet to date.  Chances are, if you don’t party, it will be easy to avoid hookup culture.
Partying you will find anywhere but also it’s easily avoided.  Both campuses will have outside speakers, concerts, and other events that don’t involve drugs or alcohol.
Social media is not representative of student bodies as a whole.
Location: Access to Wash U is probably slightly easier.  You’d likely fly in to Chicago and then a domestic flight to STL.  Public transportation (light rail and buses) is very good.  For Bowdoin, you’d probably fly into Boston and then to Portland by train or air (Portland is a smaller airport with fewer flights) and then from Portland take a shuttle or train to campus.  St. Louis is definitely more urban (although Wash U is more suburban, surrounded by upscale residential neighborhoods and a shopping/restaurant/club area called the Delmar Loop which is within walking distance of campus).  There is also a huge and beautiful public park nearby with free zoo, museums, etc.  Given its a large metro area, internship opportunities nearby are likely to be more abundant than at Bowdoin.  Bowdoin is a small, safe, charming town.  If you like outdoor recreation, mountains and coastline are easy to access and the Bowdoin Outing Club is very active.
Both campuses have rail service right next door.  From Bowdoin you can take a train to Portland - medium-sized, picturesque, and nearby, or Boston, larger and farther away.  Light rail from Wash U can get you into the city of STL and from there, points farther afield.

"Bowdoin College is a great liberal arts college. But I am not sure that I agree that Bowdoin is clearly better in your desired area of study—I don’t know.

As you know, one school has 1,800 undergraduates & the other has almost 7,000 undergraduates. The larger school should have a wider variety of course offerings.
An important factor in favor of Bowdoin College is the 12 school exchange program which allows Bowdoin students to study for a semester or a year at other member schools which includes Dartmouth College, Amherst, Williams Mystic Seaport Program, Wesleyan, Wellesley, Smith, and 5 other schools

"I can’t really comment on the hookup culture at Bowdoin, but I assume it’s probably similar at most college campuses. My S started dating someone the summer before his senior year in high school, and they kept up a long-distance relationship all four years of college, and are still together (moved to the same city) post graduation. So he wasn’t dating anyone at Bowdoin during his time there.
My S is not outdoorsy at all, and was not an athlete, but he does love cold weather. He had never been in the state of Maine before he did a trip the summer before his senior year of high school, but fell in love with Bowdoin and applied ED.
I think both schools are academic peers. My S did a minor in Government & Legal Studies (majored in History and a foreign language) and really enjoyed his time at Bowdoin.

One more question, what are your future career plans and how does name recognition fit in the future?   I bet very few people in Hong Kong/Asia in general have heard of Bowdoin.

Duke does not feel like a Southern school and even though it’s not located in a major city, there is constantly a lot going on with incredible speakers from all over the world and all sorts of research opportunities.  After taking the college tour, my D’s comment was “mom, there is so much going on there, it feels like they are throwing opportunities at you.”  FWIW, Melinda Gates went to Duke and has donated a lot of money there.  Duke is constantly is reaching out to its Alumni to create internships and all sorts of learning opportunities for its students.  Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley.
I think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn’t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates.
But these were our impressions. Hopefully others can give you theirs too so you can get a better feel about if there’s a consistent theme.   Good luck, and you really can’t go wrong. Once you choose, don’t look back, only look forward.

I think with most things what you do matters much more than where you go but there are some exceptions. Harvard’s neurosurgery residency program probably won’t seriously consider an applicant who didn’t attend a top medical school. Similarly, some VC firms virtually require their employees to have elite undergraduate degrees.

"I don’t think there is a meaningful difference in the opportunity to party at Dartmouth vs. Amherst. Both have the opportunity to work hard/play hard – how much of each is up to the individual student. For what it is worth, a colleague gave a paper at Dartmouth recently and said that the Library was packed on a nice Friday afternoon – maybe students were getting the work done before the party hard, or maybe they were the work hard kids, but it seemed very intellectually engaged. In terms of culture, Amherst did have underground fraternities which have recently been banned, so Amherst is no stranger to the party scene. Amherst has worked hard to foster economic diversity.  Both have excellent soccer, at least on the Men’s side, which is what I’m familiar with. Dartmouth does have a Women’s Club team which – at the D1 level – is usually a very competitive program.  Amherst would have more of an intramural program. If you are interested in the possibility of trying out at either school as a walk-on player, contact the coach quickly to find out what, if any, opportunities there may be. On the D3 side, we’ve seen kids come to pre-season, and either make it or not.
It sounds like you somewhat prefer the scene at Dartmouth – if the money works out, they are both superb, so pick the one that feels more comfortable to you.

I’ve met several African-American alumni from Dartmouth who will probably never contribute a dime to their annual fund because they were so disenchanted by their experience there.

"@circuitrider, yep, you’re right. The administration took action to curb dangerous drinking at Dartmouth–and I think the experiment is still too young to know how successful it’s been. My understanding is that the reaction has been very mixed on campus. But you’re seriously deriding an effort to do something about the issue of excessive underage drinking, something that exists on just about every campus in America?
As for the Review, it offers a hard-right perspective that’s always represented a fraction of the student body and is held in contempt by the majority. That’s been the case since it first formed in the early 80s, and certainly Dartmouth’s student population has become decidedly more liberal since then. The D takes much more traditionally liberal positions. I happen to think publications with alternative viewpoints–across the political spectrum–are a good thing, but I object to the times that the Review has crossed the line over the years.
Once again, unless current students of color want to weigh in on the merits of Dartmouth vs Amherst, there’s little point of continuing this back and forth. And frankly, it’s not particularly germane to what the OP asked. Are there any current CS students or recent grads who can add to the discussion?

"@Waitwhatss The problem is – of the three schools being considered – the best two schools for med school (Hamilton and Wesleyan) are the opposite of the best option for engineering (GA Tech). I would not consider a 3+2 program as a realistic option. Very few students end up doing them, which requires switching colleges after your junior year. I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech. Tough decision. If you can visit all of them, that would probably knock one or two of them out.

@circuitrider Hey do you know the median salery for Weslyan student in only stem majors
[/quote]

No, and I agree with you: I wish all of these Return On Investment (ROI) surveys would break their results out by major; it would make comparing apples to apples much simpler. Suffice it to say that a STEM major is going to have pretty much the same opportunities and drawbacks at any of the top 100 colleges or universities; grades and standardized tests are how you will  distinguish yourself from the pack - not the college’s pedigree.
If you major in Bio or Chem you are probably going to have to go on to graduate school of some sort to make a decent living. Computer Science is still a very hot major and you can find a job as a programmer right out of the box. The same is true for Engineering except that a B.S degree by itself hits a salary wall about six years after graduation (at which point, a lot of Humanities and Social Science majors start catching up) and you will want to pursue at least a Masters.
IMO, Physics and Math are still the sweet spot as far as intellectual exploration and practical applications are concerned. Physics and Math majors have been known to land on Wall Street in various capacities.

"My son is currently a Hamilton / Dartmouth student. He is in the 3-2 engineering program and  loves it. Unlike the typical 3-2 where you leave the liberal arts college at the end of the 3rd year, for the Dartmouth plan the student studies at their LAC for freshman and sophomore year, then move on to Dartmouth for their junior year, when most of their friends are studying abroad. For their senior year they go back to their LAC, graduate with their friends and get their BA degree, and return back to Dartmouth for a 5th year and get their BE degree in an engineering discipline.
What is nice about this program is that the student gets an excellent STEM education at the LAC with very small class sizes where they get to really know their professors and do research as an undergraduate. At Thayer (Dartmouth’s Engineering School) you get a very project oriented engineering education with a strong entrepreneurial focus. Dartmouth is on a quarter system so many professors have their own engineering / tech companies they are running, bringing current real-world challenges to class.  Also, there is a certain camaraderie amongst all the 3-2 students from the various LAC’s.
Typically if you maintain a 3.5 or better at your LAC and take Calc I, II, III, Physics I, II, Chem, and CS, you get into Dartmouth. If I am not mistaken they get about 100 applicants a year, with about 40 or so getting accepted into the program each year.
There is no question that the 3-2 plan will require an extra year of education and the costs that go with that. However, that additional year provides you the ability to take the extensive math and science prereqs for an engineering degree, but also affords you the ability to take more humanities and social science courses. The part of the education you get at a LAC will be more discussion based (as opposed to a lecture based model), enabling you to become a more effective communicator and develop critical thinking skills. This is an investment that will make you a more marketable candidate with employers.

Chances are you will make much more money over your career in a field that you love than in a relatively high paying field that you don’t care for.

No. I know Northwestern is a great school, but I don’t really associate it with the natural sciences.  Economics and journalism come to mind when I think of Northwestern.
When I think of Vanderbilt, I think of health sciences first. That’s probably because the medical school is such a big part of the campus, and when I visit my daughter in Nashville, there are always stories on the news and advertisements about the Vanderbilt Hospital.

"Northwestern is stronger overall academically, but not six-figures stronger. The slight differences in quality/prestige are not worth that much money, unless she hated Vandy, loved NU, and you had money to burn.
In my hair-splitting undergraduate private U tier system, Northwestern is one level above Vandy. One level isn’t worth that much money unless, like I said, she is way in favor of NU and you can easily afford the cost difference.
For perspective, here’s where I have them in my hair-splitting, anal-retentive tier system:
Tier 3:
Brown
Cornell
Dartmouth
Duke
Hopkins
Northwestern
Tier 4:
Emory
Georgetown
Notre Dame

… and maybe CMU.
My tiers are based mainly on academic rep/quality, endowment, and (I’m embarrassed somewhat to say) a small drop of prestige. But mostly it’s based on academic rep and quality, as well as i’m able to ascertain. I’m strongly considering replacing prestige with undergraduate focus.

"I have posted on this topic elsehwere, but you need to keep in mind that medical school is an astounding amount of money, perhaps approaching 400,000 for a private medical school by the time medical school rolls around.  And you can’t work in the summer and much of the aid is loan based, if any.  Log onto the medical school sites to see the tution now.  Now, I firmly reject the advice that you should invariably go for the cheaper school, because the primary basis to reduce medical school costs is to get into a highly competitive low cost school (Baylor) or a free medical school (Case Western speciality school) or an MD Ph.D or merit money.  So, if you are choosing between Yale and Alabama, go to Yale.  Yale is far more likely to get you a low cost medical school.  But here, there is no discernible basis to think that Vanderbilt/Northwestern split, whatever it might be, would result in a better shot at merit money in medical school.  And both would give you a fighting shot at one of the low cost options.  I would absolutely bank the money from the CV scholarship to pay for over a third of medical school and if you are fortunate enought to get merit money or something similar, you might be able to go almost free.  Good luck.
One more point, I did not appreciate until recently how crazy medical school admissions and finances are, despite having ample reason to know.  Although you need to enjoy the college experience, going to medical school does require a four year plan, including knowing how you are going to get in (many admission rates are sub-5%, that is, as hard to get in as Harvard undergraduate) and how you are going to pay those big bucks.  It is worth logging onto the medical school websites to realize that they do count parental income, even for a 26 year old “child”.  On the other hand, not to be too much of a pessimist, right now is an amazing time to be involved in medicine and the journey, well expensive and difficult is worth it if it is your dream.

"Can you even pay for Vanderbilt with this scholarship and no loans other than the standard federal student loans?  Would your family need to borrow more than that?  Start there.
If Vanderbilt’s costs are easy to cover, how about the cost of Northwestern?  How secure is your daughter’s college fund?  Is there the equivalent of four years at Northwestern sitting in a 529 or the like? Or would you need to cobble together the money every year from multiple sources and tighten your belts?
Provided Vanderbilt is possible without huge strain for the family, this looks pretty much like a no brainer to me.  The savings are significant and could go a long way toward helping with the costs of med school or just with helping your daughter launch into life after colege.  They also can give your daughter financial freedom while in college to take an unpaid or poorly paid internship that she really likes instead of having to pin down the best payong summer job or part time school year job that she can find.

"@prezbucky - I agree with prezbucky’s grouping. Vandy is a great school but it doesn’t have the historical reputation that Northwestern has. Remember that as of 2-3 years ago, Vandy was a school ranked in the 18-22 range, competing with the likes of Emory, Rice, etc. Northwestern has been in the 9-13 ranking spot for the last 30 years. High school students are very impressionable by ranking shifts year-to-year but it takes DECADES to change perceptions. And if you take the average ranking for the last 20 years, Vandy is a top 20 school and certainly not a top 15 school. Based on attending Stanford for my MBA and living / working in NYC at a prestigious investment bank / mega private equity fund: my ranking would be.
Tier 1A: Duke / Northwestern / Brown / Hopkins / Dartmouth
Tier 1B: Cornell - I put this here because its selectivity is significantly less than the others. Ask anyone in a high-prestige job in NYC on Wall Street or ask students at top private prep schools (Dalton, Horace Mann, Trinity, Andover, Exeter, etc, ), they will put Cornell a step below the others. As of just a year ago, the average SAT at Cornell was almost a 90-100 points lower than Duke and Northwestern. That’s significant. Cornell is really a hybrid of a private ivy league and a top tier public university like Michigan, given its state subsidized schools. Part of prestige relates to exclusivity and selectivity and Cornell is the least selective of the schools in Tier 1A and 1B.
Tier 2: Georgetown / Vanderbilt / Rice / Wash U / CMU

"Maybe we can revise it to say that “Private Cornell” belongs with Duke, NU and the rest, while “Public Cornell” belongs with UNLV, or at least the hotel school does. 
In all seriousness, though, I have Cornell up there primarily because their academic rep seems to be pretty strong across the board, similar to NU and Duke. They aren’t as selective, but my tiers aren’t looking at that too much – they’re based mostly on perceived academic quality/rep and endowment (the ability to spend money to benefit students…).

"@COLLWGE1227 , just about all the feedback you have received is consistent. Unless your child is repulsed by Nashville and Vanderbilt, I fail to understand why there is even a question.
Northwestern is not significantly more prestigious. They are not renowned for “natural sciences”.  Vanderbilt has a first rate medical school and I can attest they are doing some really interesting and important research. Being close to the medical school is a huge plus. Your child might be able to shadow at Vandy Medical School or take some upper level courses or help with research over the summers.
Additionally, and just as importantly, it is crazy competitive to get accepted to medical school right out of college. If she needs to work and gain extra experience to beef-up her application post BS degree, having contacts and connections at Vanderbilt is a huge plus. She might be able to get some great job for a year or two in one of their many specialty clinics while she studies for her MCATs and applies to med schools.
The thought of my child being saddled with the cost of medical school at over 350K (not including the add’l deferred interest costs if she choose to specialize in a field requiring many additional years of commitment) is not just concerning but flat out nauseating.
One other factor, if she is the recipient of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship, that is a feather in her cap for future admissions to graduate/medical school.
So, I would counsel my daughter simply: """" if you got, use it!"""".  In other words, take the darn scholarship!

Interestingly, of the ones that I asked, the daughters all cited a particular incident that they had heard of, but were not involved with.
For most girls at college the biggest risk is not strangers, but guy students (who pretty much never think of themselves as bad guys!). In some ways that makes it harder for girls to get their head around, b/c there of the implicit trust of a fellow student. There are a lot of conversations to be had there before she goes to college- no matter where she goes. And no matter how savvy she thinks she is. When the swoon-worthy student in your study group drops by your dorm room to talk about a class project, it’s hard to believe that their understanding of the relationship could be that different than yours- or how badly it can end (recent experience of a friend’s daughter at a different university).

Kenyon is about an hour away from Columbus, so that coordination program sounds like it would be perhaps once a week, and a student would need a car if the school does not provide van or other transportation for participating students.
An email to the administrative assistant for the Psych dept, asking who would be best equipped within the department to answer questions about preparation for grad school and past track record for grad school admission, would be a way to get the OP’s questions in front of someone with knowledge.  The other approach is to email the Chair of the department directly, but sometimes those emails can get lost in the shuffle.

"Congrats on you and your daughter’s decision, @cttrlvr. I’m glad you found something that worked for you and your family!
You do not need to start researching grad schools now  It’s too early! Let her settle into some career goals and research/professional interests first. I wouldn’t start thinking about a list until junior year at the earliest, once she’s gotten a chance to get some research experience and a little solidity in her career goals and interests.



Also, for the sake of the usefulness of this thread over the long-term your daughter’s doctor is wrong. It is not true that students have to attend a top-tier university to have hopes of getting into graduate school; this is true across fields.* I have a PhD in psychology and I went to a small LAC that is very good but not ranked as highly as Kenyon. Per capita, small liberal arts colleges produce more PhD graduates than large research universities. Colleges like Kalamazoo, Hillsdale, Allegheny, Hendrix, Franklin & Marshall and Occidental are in the top 50 producers of science and engineering (including psychology) PhDs per capita.
I wouldn’t say a student is better off at a small LAC. It’s more that a student who has found a good fit school for her can get into graduate school from wherever she goes, as long as she pursues the kinds of experiences that graduate schools value. Assuming that’s a PhD program in psychology, that would be research experience assisting a professor in their research group, summer research experiences (preferably at another campus and/or with other professors, so she can grow her network), presenting research at conferences, maybe getting a publication (not necessary, but a nice cherry on top). They also include good letters of recommendation and writing a strong personal statement that coherently discusses research interests and career goals, but those things tend to come more naturally after a student has had these kinds of experiences and connections. Good grades and high GRE scores are also necessary. And if she’s interested in clinical psychology, clinical volunteering experience is necessary as well.
A sufficiently motivated student could get that anywhere - a great small liberal arts college or a great large public university. The doctoral students I knew (at my own program and those I created networks with) came from across the spectrum of colleges and universities, from top-tier places to small regional public universities.
*I should add that in some fields - like math or philosophy - undergrad college may matter more.

"I’m no expert and you seem to see the picture well. One thing to consider, even for good students, is that pre-med is time consuming. Having to work while in school is a huge disadvantage. If you go to medical school then at some point in the future you will have a similar choice: do I work where I fit or where the prestige is highest?
At Harvard you will be a dime a dozen. At Georgia Tech they are rolling out the red carpet and pre-selecting you as a standout for whom they are providing a standout experience.
In the future, do you take a job somewhere with low taxes, low cost of living, lots of autonomy but away from big city amenities; or do you live in a crappy condo, pay half your money in taxes, spend 10% of your life in traffic, but work at a prestigious facility? In the end, it is your call!

"Yes, it is. Take Harvard. It will improve your odds for a top professional school, no matter how your interests evolve.
Harvard and Stanford have the strongest combination of undergrad, plus grad schools in law, business, medicine, engineering, and education.
Universities in the second most influential group are Columbia, Penn, and Yale. (And Chicago, if you ignore the lack of an engineering program).
The third group is Duke, Northwestern, Cornell, Michigan, and Berkeley (but has no medical school).
There are also a few influential but less broad schools: MIT, Cal Tech, and JHU.
These few schools control an outsized percentage of the top undergrad and grad school programs. Unsurprisingly, they tend to admit more of their own students to their grad programs (how could they explain to the Trustees that their own undergrads received a relatively poor education?) They also admit more students from the other schools in the group (because no one benefits from an admissions war.)
In the end, you can get into a top program from any school, but your odds are a bit better if you begin from inside the group.

"I think much of the advice here, but not all of it, is simply wrong, or at least incomplete, because it fails to take into account the realities of paying for medical school.  Harvard is the easy and obvious choice here because admission to and payment for medical school is like undergraduate but on steroids.  Admissions rates hover around 3-5% for even a mid level medical school.  Costs are above 80,000 a year right now, and are going to be even higher in four years.  So, when people say take the money at Georgia Tech they are assuming that your chance of admission and cost will be the same.  I disagree.  With 3% admission rates, Harvard is clearly the better choice for admission to medical school, even, as I readily agreed, GT is a great school and a fine choice standing alone.  But, from the financial point of view, what you want for medical school is either admission to a low cost or free medical school (Baylor or Case Western) or merit money from the medical school.  If you don’t get that, medical school is going to cost you nearly 400,000.  The medical schools compete for the very best applicants with merit money.  So, financially, that is the goal, to have such a stellar record that you can go to medical school at a far lower cost, and I would pay 80,000 all day for the chance to a) cut my medical school bill down and b) improve my chances for admission.
And, I am not, really not, picking on GT.  I think it is a great school.  But for kicks, just go to the websites of the top medical schools and see where the students came from.  Harvard, Yale and the like are overrepresented.  (Just to be clear, I did not go to Harvard I am just looking at the facts).  How many GT undergraduates are at Harvard medical school.  How many Harvard undergraduates?
And one more note for admission.  This forum is littered with threads that discuss people who failed to recognize just how tough it is to get into one of the elite schools.  Well, virtually every single medical school is sub-10% admission and requires the whole package of grades, EC, recommendations and more just to be considered. By way of example, George Washington Medical school has a three percent admission rate, lower than Harvard undergraduate.   You can’t just get A’s and get in, any more than you get get into Harvard that way.  All these people just assuming you can go or go to Harvard for med school, as if you could just walk up and get in.  No way.  So, if my dream was to be a doctor, and Harvard could facilitate that, it would be worth 80,000, particularly if was a way to cut down the huge cost of medical school.

"I agree nearly 100 percent. With the exception that only looking at Harvard medical school as the analysis of who gets in doesn’t represent even 3 percent of the medical school population.  If Harvard medical school is the end game then it is, of course, relevant. But that is not the practical application of your post. It is not reslistic for a Harvard undergrad to plan on Harvard medical school. In terms of sheer numbers I believe a school like university of Florida has the second most medical school admits in 2017. A big part is the size of the population. It may be for a pragmatic kid with h stats is to go to uf for free. Kill it and nail mcat. Then be assured of  med school and perhaps h, but the best chance of zero debt for both.

"I agree with @privatebanker on his first point but disagree on the second.  @manyloyalties posits a powerful argument, but it’s built on a lot of assumptions.  A lot of assumptions.
GA Tech knows that you’re an elite admit.  This is why they are offering a full ride, plus a stipend (they are paying you to attend!), plus money for research and internet travel, plus several other perks.  What is Harvard’s pitch? Nothing, aside from admission.  Harvard will not sweeten the deal (there is no deal; you’ve been admitted; that’s it).  Harvard will not work to compete with other offers.  Harvard doesn’t have to.  It’s Harvard.
But what does that mean?  Listen, I am not anti-Ivy.  I admire the students who have worked so hard to gain admission to the Ivies, Stanford, Duke and so on.  But I also admire those who take a pass, knowing that there’s a better offer on the table.  You’ll also be known on the GA Tech campus, and for the rest of your life actually, as the guy who got into Harvard but told them to take a hike.  There’s something admirable about that.
You’re in a position that is common.  You got into your dream school, but your family cannot afford it.  I don’t know if this is because your family’s EFC at Harvard is too high or because your parents are not willing to pay it.  Either way, Harvard is unaffordable.  GA Tech is not.  Full rides should not be treated lightly, and I know that you are not doing so.  In fact, I got a strong sense that you know that GA Tech is the smart move.  It’s the brand name and prestige of Harvard that is beckoning.
Google the story of the young man who was admitted to all eight Ivies, plus Stanford, Duke, and so on.  He turned them all down to accept an offer just like yours to attend the U. of Alabama.  Why?  The same situation as you.  He wants to become a doctor and felt, with the cost of medical school ahead, he would be best served (and save his family money) to take the full ride.
I wish you best with whatever choice you make.

"Yeah, we had this discussion on another thread and I do not make light of a difficult choice and I appreciate your thoughtful comments.  It seems to me it doesn’t matter that UF sends a lot of kids to medical school for this analysis.  UF is much bigger and sends a smaller percentage.  And a smaller percentage to to top schools.  And I can see a path to going state school if you state medical school is cheap, and that is where you want to go, and the flagship sends a lot of kids.  So, UT austin on a full ride might lead you right to a cheap, but top, texas medical school.  Then your total debt might be minimal.  But that is not the case here unless the plan is to go to a georgia State medical school.  And, even then, I venture, going to harvard would likely result in merit money.  My point overall is that it is way to simplistic, if medical school is in the cards, not to even consider how it will play out with the next, larger, expenditure of 400,000 and the 3% admission rates.  I believe that you are far more likely to get in, and get merit money, coming from Harvard.  In that case, the debt is worth it.  I would say, at a mininum, nobody should simply assume that you can get the same output (cheap medical school), from a different input (GT v.Harvard but should at least look at the cost and stats from each school for medical school.

"I just think this is not the correct analysis and I am not assuming anything, I am relying on facts.  Its not the cost of the undergraduate, but the total cost of undergraduate plus medical school.  Its also the ability to fulfill the dreams of a medical career.  It is not accurate to say that GT will necessarily produce the same result, although it could.  You are assuming that going to GT will lead to the same medical school and same cost as Harvard.  I am not assuming anything.  The facts show that Harvard students obtain admission to elite medical schools at a much higher rate.  Go onto the websites of the top medical schools and see how many came from Harvard and how many from GT.  Now, I don’t think it is a mistake to go to GT.  It is a great school and free.  If you do extraordinarily well, you will get into medical school and maybe get merit money.  Life doesn’t give you pat answers.  But, I guess I just don’t get the simplistic analysis that Harvard or other elite schools are just “prestige” or “names.”  They offer a lot beyond the name and here it is a fact that those resources lead to admission to top medical schools at much higher rate than GT and likely a much higher cost.  If you give that up fine, but don’t argue that all you are giving up is a name.

"I just noticed that OP also has UGA Foundation Fellows as an option. That might be worth considering as well, given that there would likely be less grade deflation as compared with GA Tech. The ostensibly higher GPA at UGA (compared with GA Tech) might help with future admission to med school. Also, graduating as a Fellow (top student at UGA) would likely lead to some scholarships from some medical schools as well, assuming OP does not change majors along the way.

The question is if undergraduate plus medical school is $480,000 or $400,000, an astounding number but true, and Wash U offers merit money and a “free” md PHD program, are you better off spending the 80,000 to be one of the 56 or saving the 80 to be one of the seven.

Yale 25% 1420
Without more data points,  it is hard to tell exactly, but you could interpolate and get close. I envision two overlapping bell curves with Yale’s shifted and elongated to the right.
Anecdotally:
The only kid who got into Yale from our HS in the past 7 years had a 1420 (Naviance makes it easy to figure this out). He had a 4.0 as do pretty much the top 10% of the class (my kid said he was very smart). FWIW, he had the “mother of all” non-sports ECs for Yale. His EC was off the charts for a high school kid.

"You’re aware of the annual limits on federal student loans, right?

Maybe your parents are willing to co-sign for private loans that exceed those limits. Even so, I’d suggest that the limits are there for a reason. Somebody’s analysis leads to the conclusion that &gt; $31K is not advisable.  FWIW, Yale’s average debt at graduation is about $14K (for students who have any loans, that is, not for all students). So, by both those standards, $60K is a lot (especially if you’re serious about med school, and if $60K represents only part of a much bigger cost difference).

"@PurpleTitan
Regarding rigor, I did not attend Yale, so I cannot speak for it. But I was a Journalism major at UW, and I thought it was hard. I wrote a whole mess of research papers (one 12-pager was written twice, when my floppy disk somehow didn’t save it properly the first time… oh joy), about two-thirds of my non-STEM exams were essay- or case-based and the multiple choice exams were A-J/K/L rather than A-D. Granted, I had an active social life, and I could have worked harder, but I had a hard time earning A’s there. UW does not seem interested in handing out A’s that aren’t earned. I was a 3.8, single-sitting uncoached 30 kid from northern Wisconsin, and for the first time in my life, I couldn’t coast. A lot of kids simply can’t handle the academics or the academics/social balance, but it isn’t a cakewalk for the other 67ish% who can.
That said, kids can become distracted at Yale too, and I would imagine if one were to not give great effort, it would show in his or her GPA. Yale is a proud school – they care about their grad rate, but they also care about their academic rep.
I have a dog in this race, but if everything else were even or nearly so, I would suggest Yale. But it’s not – it’s six-figures not, and this kid wants to go to med school.
OP, UW is a blast. Paying $5k per annum vs. $70k at Yale makes it, to me, the better choice given your circumstances.

"I sometimes wonder about how people make personal finance decisions. Perhaps your parents are willing to part with your future inheritance in order for you to go to Yale and that is admirable. But the money is all in the same pool Assuming that you + parents are out zero for UW Madison x 4 years vs being out $240,000 for going to Yale for 4 years, in what way is that affordable?
To put it in perspective, if you were to invest that amount of money (the 240K) at age 22 and earn 7% per year on average until you retire at age 65 you would be ahead $4.4 million! You are not likely going into medicine for the money, but money does matter. If you are a doctor and figuring out any job, any year, any change, etc. it will always matter to you.
Obviously, Yale is Yale. And $4.4 million in retirement is $4.4 million. That is more than most doctors have in savings when funding their own retirements after a career of work. If you have children or spouse for whom you want to provide in the future, the decision is simple. UW is a good school and offers a lot of opportunities.

"Every year we have similar discussion.  Yale’s COA is 280K now.  The answer is different for every family, there is no clear answer.  My short answer above is based on what OP posted - parents could afford to pay their share and OP would come out with 60K loans.  I know so many students who have changed their mind about medical school.
My daughter was offered a full tuition at a 2nd tier LAC.  I also had a hard time to walk away from 40K/yr back then, but It was my daughter who said she would be willing to borrow 10k/yr from me to go to an Ivy.  I also thought about what we could do with 200K.  I decided the ROI on my D could be much higher than if I’ve put it in any other investment.
There is a discussion on the Parent Forum about if it matters what school your kid goes to, maybe it is worth a read.  From my personal experience, it does matter and it matters more than just the first job.  My older daughter is making top 1% salary at an age of 27 and my younger daughter is finishing up a 2 year internship where they only hired from Ivies and Stanford.  I think her internship helped her greatly in getting into a top 4-5 law school.  We are again at a crossroad of be a full pay at that top law school or take the scholarship from a lower ranking law school.  A very good friend of D2 was just offered an assistant editor job at a major newspaper.  He also went to a top ranking school.  The competition was fierce because the job paid over 70K with benefits.  They had a lot of applicants and they had to use some filters to limit number of people they wanted to interview.
If your parents are liquidating their 401K or emptying out all of their savings acct to pay for Yale then your family can’t afford it.  On the other hand, if your parents had put away money and planned on paying for your college (maybe in state), then I wouldn’t miss out on the opportunity of going to Yale.  I am in no way saying one couldn’t get a very good education from UW, but it is different than what you would get Yale.  You need to make a decision as to what it is worth to you (family).

"I realize there are more important things than money, but for the sake of argument…
A physician graduating from Harvard undergrad will make exactly as much money as a graduate from a small extension campus of a state university. Undergrad has nothing to do with compensation.
In the situation above, where the recent graduate got the $70K per year job: I assume her alternate path would be a lesser paying job, say $40,000 just for discussion. Say both jobs are in California. the 70K job will take home about 52K after federal, state, social sec, medicare, etc. The 40K job will take home will take home about 33K for a difference of 19K per year.
Keeping the arithmetic simple 240K divided by 20K is a 12 year payback. But the arithmetic is not that simple. If the 240K were invested it would likely double resulting in a payback of 24 years. And that assumes that a 22 year old would start saving 100% of the difference between the two jobs, the likelihood of which is about zero. So the real time to pay back easily exceeds a quarter century for most people.
I am not arguing that making more money is pointless. However, giving up savings and compounding investment returns in exchange for a system of progressive taxation a questionable choice. The same is true on the other end of the workalike calendar. If you are nearing retirement, would you rather have saved more than enough or hope that your final years are the highest paying and maybe you can save the difference realizing that is precisely when companies will wonder about younger, less expensive replacements? I would pick savings.
A hard to calculate factor is that compensation arc. For the physician, the slope of the arc is zero. It just doesn’t matter where a person did undergrad. For many other jobs, the Ivy league graduate might have an accelerated compensation arc over a career, mitigating the time for payback of the more expensive education.

"Agree with the financial analysis of @WISdad23 above.  Given the huge disparity in total net costs, I think it is an easy decision if the OP is pretty certain of med school and if the prospects of getting into a good med school between Madison and Yale are equivalent, absent OP’s family being so wealthy that the extra quarter million bucks ± is immaterial to them.  If, however, the prospects of med school are not so certain, the calculus does change somewhat.  Then it is a question of what Madison offers as likely alternatives to Yale in other departments/interests both academically and student life-wise.  Here we have 2 very different institutions.  The OP may thrive in both or one may offer a superior fit vs. the other.  Besides money, we have to consider the value of the experience for 4 very critical years that OP can never get back.
I shared a personal anecdote on another similar thread involving Georgia Tech vs Harvard.  My brother chose to go to an honors program of a top public institution.  He ended up at a great med school and then on to residency at one of the top programs in his specialty.  He is very successful and happy.  He wanted to be a doctor from childhood. However, I am only aware of one friend of his from undergrad that he maintains regular contact with. I, on the other hand, had no clue what I wanted to do/be entering college.  I did not decide on a major until junior year.  Going to law school was almost a default.  My closest friends these days though are predominantly my buddies from Yale.  About a dozen of us still take an annual boys’ long weekend trip each year.  They are successful doctors, lawyers, bankers, engineers, business owners and journalists – I think we have all made each other smarter and better people.

"Assuming that the total debt is going to be 60,000, rather than 240,000, the advice to go to Madison(which is a common theme here on CC) is, in my view, catastrophically poor advice.  To begin with, over the course of a succesful career in medicine, 60,000 is effectively meaningless.  Just do the math of lifetime earnings of a physician.  To turn down a superior opportunity over 60,000 is poor thinking.  So, is Yale superior?  The posters keep saying it doesn’t matter where you go undergraduate for med school admissions, but that is absolutely false.  Yale, as a matter of fact, gets a higher percentage of students, at a lower GPA, then Madison into medical school.  Medical school admission rates are as low as Stanford and Harvard for undergraduate.  Wouldn’t you want every advantage.  And to suggest that because people at Yale are smarter than people at Madison that your grades will be lower proportionately, is also not factual.  Top schools are known for grade inflation and helping students.  And Madison has many talented students in pre-med.  The idea that you can breeze through pre-med weed out courses at Madision and would struggle at Yale is simply guess work.  But the flawed nature of the advice, even from a financial perspective, comes out when you take a closer look at med school admissions and merit aid.  Top med schools also have better financial aid and better MERIT aid.  If you do well at Yale, you will be much more likely to be accepted at a top medical school with better aid and medical school is much much more expensive than undergraduate.  And if you want MERIT aid for medical school, you better be a top top applicant.  Now, if the amount is 240,000, that is different story because then you may end up borrowing on top of that amount for medical school, and that total number will balloon. I am not knocking Madison at all.  Great school.  But the poor advice here needs to be addressed.

That is leaving aside the fact, left out of the advice here, that medical school admission rates at less than elite medical schools are running around 5% and even very strong students are being rejected.

And they are picking those 8 or 9 %  or 3% out of a carefully cultivated group of high achieving students.  That is, getting into medical school is just like getting into Ivy League caliber schools and now requires the same resume building stuff for undergraduate but ramped up, research, community service, recommendations.

"As the majority of posters have written, UW-Madison.
OP, the only thing that’s tugging at you is the brand name of Yale.  Funny thing about college choice: it is both a significant but a not-so-really life-altering decision as people think.  The decision about where to attend seems bigger than it really is.  For instance, many, many students wish they could be in your shoes and attend Madison.
Another issue, and I hope this isn’t too personal.  But if you are expected to pay full freight at Yale, this means that your family is full pay.  I understand that some full pay families are right on the bubble, expected to cover the complete COA even though a family might feel that this is beyond their means.  However, if I am reading things right, your family is willing to pay 220K towards your Yale education, and you are expected to handle the remaining 60K?
Question: why aren’t you or your parents suggesting what strikes me as the obvious?  “Son (or dear daughter), you will attend UW-Madison, and we will finance your medical school costs up to 220K.”  In other words, if medical school is in your future, why spend so much of everyone’s money (yours (in the form of future debt) and your parents’) on undergrad?  Am I missing something?
If your family could comfortably afford Yale, that would be different.  If the debt were lower (let’s say 30K, which many students do take on; debt is the reality for most college students), maybe that would change things, too (even though I don’t think Yale is worth 30K in debt, not when the other option is practically free).

"Re-read the posts, may have missed some still but – OP says they have to personally borrow $15 a year , as a student, to get through Yale, and family will struggle but manage the rest of the cost of full pay at Yale. The alternative is full tuition award at Madison, so costs are room and board, books, travel to MN which would be about $12-15k a year, total. If the med school goal is unwavering and committed, then UW seems the only affordable option (and a great one at that). OP cannot borrow $15k a year personally, and it sounds like family paying the remainder of full pay at Yale may well involve debt, since OP says it will be a struggle. Substantial debt for undergrad or using family resources for undergrad which could be preserved to contribute to med school, just does not make sense. And, if the merit award at UW includes any perks – research access etc., so much the better. If not, OP should apply to participate in the UW undergrad research scholars program, which gets freshman and sophomores teamed up with faculty research.

"I don’t think being near Chicago will give you more opportunities than being in Houston. Houston is a major city; it’s the fourth largest city in the United States (right after Chicago, actually!) and health, medicine, and biomedical research are  big drivers of Houston’s economy. I’d say your opportunities are roughly equal, at least in any sense that would matter to an undergrad. Rice does a lot of research and is located right next to the Texas Medical Center - but there are lots of other industries in case you change your mind.
I’ve only been briefly in both cities but it’s been my experience that moving around Chicago without a car is far easier than getting around Houston without one.
If you want something closer to the stereotypical “traditional” college experience - parties, big sports games, school spirit in spades - Northwestern is probably more likely to provide that, at least superficially. But in actuality, the “college experience” varies a lot from school to school and even from person to person. There are definitely people at Big 10 schools who haven’t attended a single sports game and don’t care a whit about sports. And college students everywhere like to party and make good friends, so you can find that at Rice, if you want!

"Houston &gt; Chicago, and this will only grow over the next 30 years.  Rice is also in the nicest part of Houston proper.
As for prestige, I think it depends on who (and where) you ask.  There is no question that while both schools’ reputations have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, I’d say that Rice’s has improved more on a relative basis, especially in the South and West of the country.

"@college1114 - both are great schools. But, the unfortunate truth is that Rice’s great reputation in Texas doesn’t travel to the to the coasts well. In NYC (arguably, the world’s capital), you will often get a blank stare when you tell someone you went to Rice. And yes, this is even among a lot of educated people. As one of my good friends went there, I have great respect for the school and its students / alumni but the reality is that it is considered more of a regional school in the NE and on the West Coast. The reasons for the less than expected footprint is its lack of well known grad programs (Law, Medical, Business, etc) and its smaller class size that was historically 50%+ Texan. This means there are very few Rice alumni on the coasts. Rice is unquestionably a great school but Northwestern is on another level in terms of reputation, name recognition and general prestige. You have a ton of Northwestern alumni in New York, LA, SF, Chicago, etc. If you can endure a Chicago winter, then I think Northwestern should be the clear winner here. Also, Northwestern has significantly more geographical diversity - it has more students from California, New York, NJ, Texas and Florida in one class year than is the total size of Rice. And that combined with its Big 10 sports, very large endowment, top grad programs (Kellogg, Feinberg, Law School) and successful alumni across industries (Colbert, CEO of IBM, etc.) make it more of a well known name. Northwestern is the ‘safer’ decision here given its more established reputation across disciplines.

Rice I was always vaguely aware of because of its connection to NASA and to Kennedy and to science in general. I know that’s just me but I am not that unique. I just went through two rounds of college for my kids neither had northwestern anywhere on their radar and I don’t think anyone from their high school applied and HS sent multiple kids to the ivies every year.

And confusing NE with NU is analogous to confusing Penn State with Penn, which doesn’t happen among educated people. Look at the top NYC private prep schools / New England private prep schools / CA private prep schools like Harvard Westlake where these students largely can choose wherever they want to go and Northwestern will be in the top 10-15 most represented schools. Rice will not be found. Also, look at the top 10-15 feeder schools to the top MBA programs, and you’ll see Northwestern there. Look at Columbia, HBS, Wharton, Stanford, etc. Rice - no where to be found. Also, look at the incoming Investment Banking analyst classes in NY at the top banks - Northwestern will have a few analysts. Rice may have some students at the Houston offices but usually not in NY. Rice is a great school. But, it’s reputation just isn’t that strong on the coats. And considering that Northwestern is more selective / has higher test scores than Rice and AND has more students from NY and NJ in its freshman class than Rice’s entire freshman class (including Texas), I would beg to differ that Rice has a stronger reputation.

Well the OP asked for opinions which would mean our biases, otherwise he would have just visited and not posted this question.

Have you gotten feedback on the relative ease of doing research as an undergrad at both? NU is more than twice as big enrollment wise, so assume you’d have more competition for research work–but would be good to check and confirm.
Average class size at Rice is notably smaller than NU, so seems like that’s something to weigh.  Some other things to check on would be the number of students declaring pre-med at each school, who your advisor(s) would be and their background/experience.  Re’ the latter, if you were able to talk to each school’s advisor and ask some open-ended questions, that could be really helpful–beyond their relative success as a “feeder” into med school.

@robotrainbow
I understand that NU is not known to you and it’s easy to generalize based on your own experience. However, people with experience with law schools (T-14 law schools), business schools (consistently top-5), economics programs (consistently top-10 with 4.9 out of 5.0 in PA score), performing arts or journalism would likely know Northwestern. That’s covering a lot of people already even at the undergrad level since econ is usually the most popular major. You mentioned science with Rice; NU actually outranks Rice in most science disciplines and has one of the best chemistry departments in the world. Like it or not, reputation is closely related to graduate programs; when two schools are of the same type (mid-sized private research in this case), the one with better graduate programs by a good margin is going to have more national reputation. There are exceptions such as being an Ivy or an elite Catholic but neither applies to Rice.

Here is some info on Rice, if you want to assess whether it is a fit:

research university with a distinctive commitment to undergraduate education; about 50% STEM, 50% humanities/social sciences
just under 4000 undergraduates
happily nerdy student body
very community focused, and many systems in place that support students and tight knit community - residential college system in particular
diversity is part of the Rice experience and mission; Rice seeks students who come from many different backgrounds and students who are comfortable with people from all different backgrounds
collaborative, supportive environment
A philosophy that “we are all in this together”; Rice is known for its “culture of care”. This is so important to Rice because Rice wants its students to continue care strongly about other people as they go into the world
Rice students and graduates are committed to making the world a better place

As mentioned in this thread, the location across from the Texas Medical Center is ideal for pre-meds. Undergraduate research is big at Rice. I just read an article about the three 2018 Goldwater Scholars at Rice this year. Lots of incredible things going on at Rice!
Another thing going on at Rice that many don’t know about is the focus on leadership skills for undergraduates. The Doerr Institute for New Leaders is available to any undergraduate who wants to develop their leadership skills. Take a look at the video: https://doerr.rice.edu

It’s possible.  I find it surprising, but I’ve seen other posts on these boards where people out east know Northeastern but not NU, or people who confuse the two.
Yes, most educated people know NU.  Also, a lot of people–educated or otherwise–know NU because of its affiliation  with the Big Ten.  There are a lot of college football fans.  There are a lot of NFL fans who may not care about the college game but sort of know that NU is a Big Ten school, Stanford is a Pac-12 school, Vandy is an SEC school, Duke is an ACC school (though Duke, of course, is much more known for its prowess in basketball).

These 2 quotes are simply wrong.
There is plenty of info out there about people who do MBAs, paid for at huge expense by their firms, who end up leaving in frustration b/c they are not promoted and/or their new skills are not utilized by their company. It is why more than a few large companies now have internal, company-specific talent development programs- so that they don’t pay for a qualification that can easily walk out the door. Similarly, people returning from international assignments often find it hard to fit back in, and use their new skillsets and perspectives, leading to a lot of attrition there as well- not to mention the ones who are (gently or not) encouraged out the door b/c there is no longer a good place for them.
Further, once you are “established in mid/upper-management”, the name of your undergrad institution is simply not a big deal- and it is certainly not “critical”.  What will matter much, much more is your experience and (if you have one) your grad degree.
My bona fides for these opinions: BA/MBA/PhD; taught both business & engineering at the university level; experience working for Fortune 500 companies; consultant at one of the big 4 consulting firms.

"Rankings are based on surveys…take them with a grain of salt. No one really knows much about more than 1 or 2 school’s undergraduate programs.
Obviously, elite privates have advantages over public universities, must have to do with resources (student to faculty ratios, etc.).
However, if you’re looking to which gives you an advantage to moving from an engineer, to a senior engineer, to an engineer manager to a technical director and up, there really is no advantage between a Duke and a Michigan degree.
Engineering is a meritocracy. Senior managers and directors will want to promote the best engineers. Most of these engineering managers/directors came from public universities, so they are not biased against them. What’s important (in your first year) is talent, work ethic, and social skills. After a few years, experience then also becomes important (an engineering manager is expected to develop their team). If you exhibit these qualities, you will be placed on the leadership track.
Of course, graduates from elite schools, are more likely to exhibit these qualities, that’s how they got into those schools in the first place! However, it’s not the school that got them selected for a leadership track, it’s their performance on the job.
Now, if you want to earn a BS in engineering, but then jump into consulting, law school, etc, that’s a different conversation.

Of course, it’s possible to jump ship and switch from engineering, into sales/marketing/project management/etc and then to a director/executive position in those areas. You don’t have to stay in engineering your whole career, the qualities that made you a good engineer, often translates into other fields, and it’s not uncommon for engineers to make those type of career changes.

Humblest, I do not give Michigan the edge over Duke in any way except in engineering, where Michigan is in fact better (with the exception of BME, where Duke is better than Michigan). Both universities are very well rounded, but Michigan just happens to be more well-rounded academically (top undergraduate programs in Architecture, Business, Music, Nursing etc…). In Duke’s favor, it is indeed more selective, and its endowment per student is larger. In all cases, the relative advantage that these universities have over each other are negligible. They are both equally exceptional.
“4. Duke has a lower acceptance rate, but the quality of the student bodies is similar”
Is there any evidence, other than personal experience, for such claim given that it is used to refute a number?""""
Sadly, no. I can only speak from experience. In-state students at Michigan have lower tests scores than OOS students, but in the classroom, they perform just as well. The in-state students I knew, and I confess to have only know a few dozen, never prepared for standardized tests. This was strange to me because like most OOS students, I worked hard on my SAT preparation. That is why I said that there is a fundamental difference in paradigm to consider when comparing test scores at public universities and private universities. As it is, I am not sure if anybody can differentiate between a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA and an average SAT/ACT of 1410/31.5 and a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA having taken similar classes, and an average SAT/ACT of 1480/33. But when you factor in the effort, or lack thereof, that in-state students at top public universities put into their standardized test preparation, the gap in test scores is likely even smaller.

So I am one student who will bring down Michigan’s average over a Duke.  But, I have a 3.9 weighted GPA in the most rigorous courses at an “elite” private school in the northeast.
I have friends who got into Duke, Northwestern,Vanderbilt with higher test scores, but easier classes but some of those same friends were rejected from Michigan.  I think just maybe Michigan looks a bit deeper into what kind of student they accept.  Their Common Data Set puts Rigor and School performance above test scores.

Rather than spliting hairs as you say Lets be honest and direct.  Duke has a far superior reputation in Finance then Michigan. Michigan is largely perceived as a safe school For talenten and smart kids givin its both large and public with managable addmissions rates.  Duke is viewed as far more selectieve with a 6.3% RD acceptanten rate.  1,900 valadictorions applied To Duke and 29% were accepted.  Stated differently i am sure there is a ven diagram that would show overlap between the two schools studen bodies but those out Side of the shared space at Duke would be far superior accademically then those out of the shared space from Michigan.
Saying things like i could have taken the ACT and grotten a Higher score or anecdotely pointing out studentes who got  rejected at Mich (potential yield Protection) but into Duke or the suggestion that michigan Somehow looks harder at applications all simply wrong ang pure speculation in the hope of Boeing persuasive.
Every number produced suggesties Duke has a prestige advantage.

Duke has a better reputation, is harder to get into and is more heavily recruited from.  Saying otherwise is purely an attempt to minimize a well defined hierarchical difference.

Those rankings are based on flawed data presented by private universities, including Duke. Duke lists its student to faculty ratio as 6:1. It is in fact 11:1 Those are the types of exaggerations that give private universities the edge in the rankings. If public universities played the same game (sadly, they cannot since their data is audited by the state), they too would be ranked much higher.
But among the educated, Michigan and Duke are peers. That is certainly the opinion of academe, which generally assigns identical undergraduate education ratings to Michigan and Duke. Also, the OP is interested in Engineering, and in Engineering, it is Michigan that is usually ranked higher than Duke.
“US. News ranks Duke # 11 in counselors rank Vs Mich at #22 and over all Duk #9 Vs Michigan #28”
You mention high school counselors  but not university presidents and provosts. Why is that?   According to university presidents and provosts, Michigan and Duke are tied at #13. This actually supports my point above, that Michigan and Duke are considered peer institutions among the highly educated.

The OP has not indicated an interest in Wall Street. As an engineer, I assume he is more concerned with Silicon Valley and tech industry jobs. If that is the case, Duke does not present an advantage over Michigan, and I certainly don’t see why the opinion of Investment Banks should be a factor in the OP’s decision.
That being said, I am surprised that Michigan was not a target at any of the major banks that you have worked for. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hired 35 undergraduate students from Ross alone last year. They also took 40 interns from Ross. Other major IBanks like BoA, Blackstone, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche, Lazard, Paribas, UBS etc…all hired Ross students as well. IBanks also recruit graduates from the CoE (Goldman Sachs hired 16 CoE graduates last year alone) and LSA, but obviously focus most of their attention on Ross. Clearly, Ross is a target, whether you care to admit it or not.

Does this report make Michigan one blip better then Duke? The sad fact (with everyone’s facts) is the op was asking about engineering. I am sure he /she is running for cover or left this thread so everyone can compare that their bike is shiner then yours… I wish this thread would end but Feel compelled to state the obvious, Duke is a small Elite Private school that can take the cream of the crop applicants. I don’t think they are taking lower Stat kids like public schools do in general. For engineering their program is very limited. I didn’t even know they had a program but just went on their website. But if I wanted one of the programs they offered I am sure it’s excellent. It’s Duke… They don’t have bad programs.
As stated in my previous posts the opportunities at Michigan are ENDLESS. To the Op, Please pm me if you want more information. My son is going into engineering to get into finance /business management. He really likes the way engineering is taught and makes you think at a different level. Again as stated, he is going back to Michigan tomorrow to do a week long leadership Capstone for their $10,000 grant. They will work with mentors also over the summer to come up with a business plan going forward. It's the first time they took a freshman group and Michigan is paying for an airbnb for the 3 of them for the week to be there....... This is how Michigan supports their students endeavors!

There is no doubt that high school kids prefer Duke to Michigan. That is not in question. Like I said, with private universities exaggerating the benefits of attendance, such as halving their student to faculty ratios to improve their ranking, it is no wonder that impressionable high schoolers prefer Duke. Employers and academe (aka, graduate school admissions), on the other hand, are not impressionable. To them, Duke and Michigan are peer institutions.

For engineering a lot of people at Duke are there because they couldn’t get into their first choice, namely Stanford, MIT, CMU, Princeton, Cornell, Harvey Mudd, even public universities like Berkeley, Georgia Tech and Michigan.
And because Duke uses ED, it’s yield is artificially higher than colleges that use EA like Michigan.  Duke’s RD yield is 37%, Michigan’s is 31%, meaning the colleges are a lot closer in selectivity.

@Alexandre attended both UMich and Cornell and stated that he did not see a difference in resources between the two.  Are you thus asserting that the resources at MIT are far and away beyond what is available at Cornell?
And what resources are you referring to?
BTW, when it comes to startup founders, from a Crunchbase spreadsheet I analyzed, yes, MIT and Stanford outpace UMich (though UMich isn’t too shabby, being in the top 10: https://news.crunchbase.com/news/top-schools-among-founders-raise-big-dollars/), but here’s the thing: roughly half or more of those MIT/Stanford alums who were startup founders were grad alums (including PhD’s and MBA’s).  And PhD’s are fully fulled while 2 years of a Master’s/MBA is significantly cheaper than 4 years of undergrad at MIT at full-pay, which is why I said that if the OP excels as much in undergrad as he has in HS, he will still be able to get the opportunities afforded MIT/Stanford alums.

Did anyone say that though? In my case, I intended to suggest that full-pay may be advisable even in circumstances where a full scholarship has been offered elsewhere. However, I didn’t convert that to a decided opinion on the two schools in question.

Well, I was saying that all full-pay MIT admits could get full rides to some school.  Agree that there are far fewer full-rides to top 50 schools.  As  said, less than 200 total at Near-Ivies/Ivy-equivalents.  Throw in Vandy, WashU, JHU, and it’s still less than 300.

Other people are implying that. With your comment (especially with the follow-up), @merc81, I didn’t get the sense that you necessarily felt that way. But for example, I interpreted Happytimes2001’s comment to mean that a full-ride to a place like Michigan isn’t so special because “anyone at HYPSM could’ve gotten it and turned it down.” Their sentence directly after that seems to imply, to me at least, that the OP should disregard the award for that reason - because MIT is so far and away better than Michigan that the money ceases to matter.
However, I think all that is irrelevant anyway. Let’s assume for a second that every single student at MIT could’ve gotten a full ride to Michigan or an equivalent school and turned it down. So what? What bearing does that have on the OP’s choice? The OP’s choice, IMO, hinges on 1) whether Michigan will provide them with a high-quality education and get them to their career and educational goals - and whether they’ll have the kind of college experience there they are looking for - and 2) whether MIT’s offerings in those areas are worth an extra $250K + interest that they could spend on any number of other things (including, potentially, an MBA or other grad degree from MIT or an equivalent school).
Other undergrads’ decisions about where they wanted to go to college don’t really matter in this case, is my opinion.

Actually, there are some aspects of increased rigor at MIT, though not to the extreme of Caltech or Harvey Mudd.  These include:
a.  First semester calculus (18.01) is basically equivalent to two semesters of calculus at most other schools.
b.  General education requirements are extensive.  Many engineering majors may not like biology, but have to take it at MIT, unlike at other schools.  The humanities, arts, and social studies requirements are heavier than at many other schools.

They are not extreme outliers. I’m surprised that you don’t know that.
For some reason, the top schools are systematically not telling people how much their students are really being compensated. A graduates salary may be $110,000 say, but then there may be a significant $50k+ signing bonus and another $200k+ in equity that accrues over a few years, and other valuable perks on top of that.

I’m a little confused here about why the cost of college has to pay off immediately. Presumably the parents put $250K in a 529 for the purposes of their kid spending it on education. If the OP wants to go to grad school in CS, that would be a fully funded program. No one pays for a CS grad degree at a good university. (Maybe they live cheaply, but that’s OK for 20-somethings.)
Is there some indication in this thread that the parents are hurting for money? The part about the parent’s retirement money seems to be the OP’s misunderstanding that grad school in CS would be something his parents would pay for.
If the money is in a 529 for education, why not spend it on MIT?
I say go to CPW and figure out whether MIT is the right school for you. If it is and your parents aren’t hurting for money, go there.

"@ucbalumnus “For the OP, a $280,000 bet on unverified claims of compensation that may still not be what most graduates from MIT will find?”
It may not be most, but it is many. I’m sharing a piece of valuable information that I have never discussed on cc: even once. Notice that no one in a position to know is disagreeing with my post? There is a reason for that.
Also, I said I would probably choose Michigan. It’s a great school. My point is that while I think most students should choose Michigan, I can imagine a scenario where MIT could make sense for a particular student on a mission.
@billscho I understand that the signing bonus is one time. In the cases I am familiar with, it does not matter because of the salaries and size of the equity stake, but I allocated it across the vesting period of the equity to get an annual amount.

"@Ynotgo:
“If the OP wants to go to grad school in CS, that would be a fully funded program.”
PhD programs worth attending are funded.
Masters programs usually are not. MBA programs may have scholarships but full-rides to top MBA programs are almost non-existent.
As for the 529 money, yes it is budgeted for education, but parents can withdraw an amount equal to the scholarship penalty-free.
As I said, even if that money doesn’t have to be used for the parents’ retirement, after 40 years (when this kid retires), you can expect that amount to be around $2M in today’s dollars.
Yes, fit matters (though it seems like the OP likes UMich more socially anyway), but from an ROI standpoint, this is a no-brainer.

FWIW, there are plenty of young people out there who are quite successful without having attended HYPMS. They may even work or attend grad school right alongside MIT grads with their lowly state school degree (of which UM does not even qualify since it is a powerhouse U.)  MIT grads aren’t like people on TV commercials walking around with a golden glow bc of their UG degree.     And the MIT degree does not guarantee automatic business success or grad school admissions.  The person behind the degree matters, and a student who qualified as a Stamps Scholar has demonstrated significant accomplishments already.
As a high school student, your perspective is limited to what you hear from others that you believe. I hope the OP of this thread is in dialogue with his parents, not his peers, and that they ignore everything except what is best for their personal situation.

"I wouldn’t pay $260k extra just for the prestige or the hope that you might earn more when you graduate. The most important ingredients in success are the people. MIT does offer on average higher quality faculty (and better access to the faculty) and a stronger student peer group than UMich, but the ultimate ingredient is you. How much do you need the advice and directions of the faculty and the pressure from your peer group to motivate yourself? If you don’t, don’t waste the money. Another factor to consider is whether you’ll be in the top quartile at MIT (presumably you’ll be in that quartile at UMich). If you’re not, you won’t likely have much better opportunities.

I personally think this is a ridiculous thing to do.  Your parents might be willing to offer it to you, but parents are willing to do all kinds of self-destructive things for their children.  At some point, it is up to the kids to look out for their parents.   You have nearly enough money saved in college savings account to pay for MIT.  If you choose it over the full ride, you should commit to providing the rest on your own and not further burdening your parents.  They have already done their part.

@tettnanger did write that “We could probably pay for around 2 years of Michigan in-state”.  Presumably, this is after the affect of in-state FA, if any.  Of course, what a college defines as “full need” may not necessarily be the same as what the parents/student think they need to afford it.

"“If the equity compensation was in stock options, then they should have a strike price the same as the market value as of the grant date. So their value (as they vest over time) is zero unless the stock price increases”
Fischer Black and Myron Scholes and the Nobel Prize Committee beg to differ.
""""if the equity compensation was in restricted stock units that vest over time, then it seems unlikely that an already-publicly-traded company would offer $200,000 of such to an entry-level employee for the first job out of (any) college, """"
The student received 5 offers, all from the usual suspects including 3 of the big 5. 2 of the student’s offers (including one from a big 5) included equity of that magnitude.
“barring something extremely exceptional that is unlikely to be college-dependent.”
Yes, this student is exceptional, but there are many exceptional students. This student lacks that one big thing you can point at, so no Olympic medal or Rhodes Scholarship, for example.
Is the outcome college dependent? I don’t know. Every talented kid is a bit different. What they need to thrive is different. We never really know about the road not taken.
Again, I would choose Michigan based on the information presented. It is a great school. My point is simply that for certain particular exceptional students, who see MIT as a better fit, I can imagine a situation where MIT could be worth it if it. I have no reason to believe that is true for the OP of this thread though.

If you check professional job listings, you’ll see that there is no distinction between schools, in fact the bachelors is just a minimum requirement.  Experience is where the money and career grows.

"The excerpt below is from Quora re: MIT vs topknotch public schools that are highly regarded for STEM. Nonetheless, I’d probably still go with the full ride from Michigan and MIT for grad school.
""""The biggest issues that I might consider in the public vs private (school) analysis would be class sizes, professor-student interaction, and availability of opportunities outside of the classroom. This would include access to professors beyond posted office hours, availability of special programs, access to research opportunities, unique study abroad programs, funding for special programs/personal student projects/student clubs.
Then try to evaluate how much you would take advantage of these special programs at the more expensive school — how “necessary” vs “that would be kind of nice but no big deal” are they to you? Frankly if Baskins Robbins ice cream parlor offers 31 flavors but all you ever order is chocolate — then what difference do the rest of those 30 flavors make to you? They could be the most exotic flavors on the planet, but if all you ever order is chocolate, then so what?
MIT’s price tag includes this overwhelming multitude of opportunities — but if all you want is to take a basic set of CS classes (that nearly every good university offers) and get your degree as quickly and expediently as you can — well, why pay for the extras that you’re never going to use? MIT is the ultra deluxe education package deal. Is that what you and your parents want, can afford (preferably without going into debt), and are willing to pay for — because you’re really going to take advantage of all of these incredible opportunities?
Okay, so what are some of these extras?
For a kid who likes small instead of big, there are freshman learning communities of only 50 freshman and class sizes between 8 - 12 frosh, turning MIT into a STEM version of a LAC.; MISTI (internships all over the world, all expenses paid); IAP (a ton of fun, enriching, and/or educational things to do during the January term); externships (1 month internships during Jan term sponsored by MIT alumni); wanna do research with a professor? Word on the street is that it usually only takes on average 3 emails to snag one!; UROP (undergraduate research program); Super UROP (an extended and beefed up version of UROP); I don’t know the dollar amount but pretty generous funding for the robotics clubs (I’m guessing on the order of maybe $50,000?, but I really don’t know so don’t quote me on this one); ability to test out of required classes; personal one-on-one meetings with your advisor prior to registration every single semester; both general advisors for freshman who haven’t declared yet and major-specific advisors later on; rarely a problem getting classes in your major (although ironically you might have trouble getting less essential classes like PE, glass blowing and toy design); no problems graduating in 4 years (or at least not due to impacted majors anyway); able to take upper division classes and grad classes at will, even as a freshman; prerequisites that are “guidelines” not requirements; athletic coaches that get the fact that your course load is hard and that you’re at MIT to be a student first and an athlete second; a ton of extracurriculars and clubs (although I suspect that most public schools also have this), M.Eng. program (get your Masters in Engineering in only 1 extra year instead of 2, offered only to MIT undergrads), taking classes with professors who wrote (or are writing anew) the textbook; phenomenal, out-of-this-world research going on in the labs; tons of support (free tutoring, mental health counseling, etc.); funding for dorm activities, outings, trips to help dorm bonding; a resident professor living in every dorm and a grad stud on every floor; and, last but by no means least, the amazingness of your fellow classmates, roommates, frat mates. I could go on and on….but my hand is tired of keyboarding now. Hopefully you get the picture.

UPenn will probably have more opportunity for research just by sheer numbers - less students and similar number of labs.

There is a very significant difference in these two schools, and in their students. On average, it is not close. “Comparable” is just what you say to people who were rejected from Penn to make them feel better. They will get an excellent education at Penn State. However, it is not comparable. You should choose Penn.
Based on your questions, I strongly suggest that you contact Penn and work this summer with an advisor to understand as much as possible about Penn. It is an extraordinary place, but you have to know how to study, prepare for classes, how not to get behind and how to capture the benefits of all of the clubs and opportunities it offers. There are more opportunities there than hours in the day. You have no idea right now how much you don’t know. The sooner you begin to understand the opportunity you have and how to fully capture the benefits, the better.
If you can do that, you will receive a truly world-class education.

An example in which UPenn will differ from Penn State: both have good career centers that will help you find an internship. But it’s your first internship, so, it’s unpaid. If you’re at Penn State, your choice is either to drp the unpaid internship and work to make money or take the internship that will advance you in your career.but be without any money earned over the summer which you will need to pay tuition. If you’re at Upenn, no worry, they will give you a stipend to compensate the fact your internship is not paid and so you can get on your career path right away with no financial trouble - basically you have your bread and eat it too.

I recommend that you contact Penn admissions and schedule an appointment with a counselor either by telephone or in person. Just call the main number (215) 898–7507, and ask for admissions. Once you get to admissions tell the person you have been admitted, and that you have some questions and would like to speak with a counselor.
Talk with the counselor about your concern about grades in pre-med. Ask about what a sample schedule would look like. Ask about research opportunities (Basically any student can get involved in research). Ask about opportunities for pre-meds to get involved in clubs. Ask about opportunities to get guidance about issues like what med school applicants need besides a GPA and an MCAT score. Tell them about your other acceptance too. Let them help you.
You should go to Quaker days too, but begin getting more information right away. Knowing more will help you make a better decision.
Also, consider the fact that most pre-meds at any college decide not to stay in pre-med. None of those students think it will be them switching out. If that happens to you, you are better off at Penn.

CM is a very good school, but it just isn’t comparable except in computer science. CMU does not have nearly the resources of Penn. For example, the Penn endowment is almost 10 times larger than CMU’s.
From my perspective, it is pretty clear that Penn offers you the best opportunity. The important thing for you is getting a lot of guidance on how to capitalize on all of those opportunities. The opportunities they offer will not benefit you if you don’t know they exist or how to access and prioritize them.

You have been admitted. The Admissions Office isn’t judging you anymore. Admitted students are part of the Penn family. Now Penn needs to ensure that you are supported and successful.
You have what it takes to succeed, or they would not have admitted you, and Penn has the classes, support, resources, and opportunities to make this a life-changing four years for you. The critical thing is to connect early with people who can guide you to access and take full advantage of those resources and begin that process early.
As you begin to do that, realize that at Penn rigorous academics is only a piece of the puzzle. Getting involved in extracurricular activities like research, internships, clubs, travel abroad, etc. are a big part of the experience. Developing a social network is also important. Social connections often begin with pre-orientation activities, which you should participate in, your dorm, and the clubs you join.

Yeah – if you’re around distracted people in class, or have teammates who are less than enthusiastic in a team assignment, that can suck. Of course, those issues have more to do with discipline and motivation than knowledge.
I think discussion settings are where large differences in scholastic ability might come out. Another place is in the grading curve.

Choose Alabama for the undergrad value, which includes saving money for grad school.  Do not choose it for the law school value.  You can make the law school choice at a much later date, after you have a better idea of your future geography and likely apply to some T14s as well.  (Do not underestimate how much more difficult it is to get a BigLaw interview, let alone a job, at a firm outside the region as an Alabama law student than it would be as a T14 law student.  The difference in ranking between, say, a #10 and #27 is much larger than it may seem and is not analogous to undergrad ranking systems, where such a difference would be slight.)

Case in point, and I know it’s just anecdotal, but my brother graduated T14, decent but unspectacular grades, probably top half, with nothing special as far as law review or other credentials.  He stopped taking interviews after the first 9 firms, including several Big’s.  His wife went to a mid tier law school, similar resume.  She got interviews only with smaller regional firms.  The more prestigious firms will only look at the very top students from schools like hers.
Now even if you don’t necessarily desire Big Law, starting out there opens all kinds of doors.  Many move on to smaller firms, clerk for judges, and other things enabled by having those connections and that line on the resume.

You can’t compare a giant state school to an elite private university. The best students at Berkeley are on par with the best students anywhere but there is much more variability at the bottom of the class. This is the price state schools pay for ensuring access to a great education. Berkeley’s mission is very different from Duke’s mission.
Also, Duke has almost twice as many Rhodes scholars as Berkeley (despite being a fraction of the size). Not bad for a “party school”.

But Duke is NOT Harvard. I’m sorry; but you are only deluding yourself if you’re thinking Duke = Harvard.
For school prestige and brand name recognition, Berkeley is much more closer to Harvard than Duke is to Harvard. Perhaps some students may be choosing private schools over Berkeley because they prefer the system – how almost everything is being handed out to them rather than them making an effort to get those same things. But that doesn’t have any bearing to school prestige, particularly in this case, and specially for engineering. The data I showed are full-proofs and true testaments to my arguments.
Duke may be able to offer a more caring environment with the kind of personal attention it gives to its students, but it doesn’t mean it’s automatically more prestigious. If we have to go by that logic, then it would appear all the LACs are more prestigious than Duke. But I don’t think there’s any LAC out there I can honestly consider to be more prestigious than Duke. So, that logic fails.
For many, many aspiring engineers, yes, they would rather have Berkeley (than Duke) behind their names. As a matter of fact, for those people, Duke is almost non-existent on their radar.

Also, as the UC system is becoming very reliant on international students who pay significantly more than in-state students. Many of these internationals are viewed as sources of funding. They do not necessarily have the credentials to be admitted to a school like Berkeley.

I agree Duke is a fantastic school, as a whole. In the same way that I agree Yale, for instance, is an amazing school, in general. But those schools have weaknesses and engineering happens to be the worst of them. Coincidentally, engineering happens to be Berkeley’s one of its strongest departments, and Berkeley – its name – is highly reputable, not only in America but throughout the whole universe. Duke, though good as a whole, doesn’t enjoy such grandiose reputation as Berkeley’s, specially in the tech universe.

What they care more about is how to become the next Elon Musk or how to become a successful startup founder, if not to work for those giant tech companies in the Bay Area and make six-figure salary (excluding bonus) as just entrants. That doesn’t make Berkeley engineering inferior to Duke simply because the school doesn’t have the same culture as Duke’s. And, btw, what is Oxford engineering compared to Berkeley’s!

Berkeley is not in the same class as elite private universities when it comes to the overall quality of the student body. That is just a fact (look at the standardized test scores)
[/quote]

This is pure ignorance. I’m sorry that I had to say that.
Here’s why.
Berkeley weighs HS GPAs more than it does standardized test scores, while Duke does the reverse. One can take SATs twice and submit the highest scores – we call that, super-scoring. Duke is notoriously known to have been employing that tactic.
Now, if you can show me any data that says Duke has a higher SAT score than Berkeley College of Engineering, I will concede.

"1). Duke as a university tends to care very little about standardized test scores (look at Duke med, Fuqua, etc.) so claiming that Duke is “notorious” for doing that tells me that you are misinformed. Also, it would be prudent to refrain from making assertions that you cannot back up.
2). Standardized test scores are probably more informative than GPAs because they are STANDARDIZED.
3). Do you really think that Duke’s GPA range is lower than Berkeley’s? Seems highly improbable but I can’t find data on Duke’s GPA range.

the UC system is becoming very reliant on international students who pay significantly more than in-state students. Many of these internationals are viewed as sources of funding. They do not necessarily have the credentials to be admitted to a school like Berkeley.

"The funding cuts are very real.

“UC faculty leaders said the results confirm their fears that the university’s excellence would decline without greater state investment. The state share of costs per student dropped from $14,690 in 1996 to $7,160 in 2017, according to UC data. The university has made up some of the difference by hiking tuition and increasing the number of out-of-state students, who pay more, but both efforts have sparked opposition.”
http://www.dailycal.org/2015/11/23/to-fund-enrollment-boost-uc-will-phase-out-out-of-state-financial-aid/
Along with the elimination of financial aid for incoming out-of-state students, the university is increasing nonresident tuition by 8 percent in the next year and projecting to enroll an additional 1,200 nonresident undergraduates.
Out-of-state students make up a significant portion of students on the university’s flagship campus — roughly 35 percent of UC Berkeley’s incoming students were nonresidents in 2014.
Abril raised concerns about the effects of cutting out-of-state financial aid on campus diversity.
“You’ll be creating a pipeline for that percentage of students to be entirely socioeconomically homogeneous,” he said. “You’ll lose most of the students who would ever consider coming here who are low income and out of state.”

Berkeley is elite and especially in STEM. But it’s big it’s public, in California, urban and it’s a known also for its political activism. Fact
Duke is also elite. Well known in everything but engineering and CS. Private, traditional college town and campus feel and known for a more preppy and sporty overall vibe. Fact

I personally prefer my tiers based off of alumni achievements:

"@Lehigh2022 - Most students don’t borrow that kind of money.  Most students only borrow the student loans, and go to places that they can afford without loans bigger than that.  That is why nationwide most students go to community colleges or commuting distance 4-years.
The students who attend the expensive places have:

parents who have saved a lot of money to pay for college, or
parents who make a lot of money, or
parents who are willing to live on one parent’s income for four years and spend all of the other parent’s income on college costs, or
grades/test scores/other talents that will get them significant merit-based aid, or
family income that qualifies them for significant need-based aid, or
parents/grandparents/siblings/other relatives who are crazy enough to borrow and/or cosign big loans.

My kid went to community college for two years, and then to an in-state U, because that was what fit our budget.  She graduated with only the junior and senior year student loans.  We didn’t take on any debt.  This has not kept her from being successful in her career.
Run all the numbers that you have so far here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/awardletter.phtml
Look at what the loan amounts mean here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml
Then run the numbers again assuming you do your first two years at a CA CC, and finish up at a UC or CSU.  That may be your best option overall.

"I was vacantly watching a hockey game on TV just now and running through some numbers in my head.
This is not directly related to your ability to afford college, maybe, but it could be, and it certainly could improve your ability to have fun in college and provide for your future:
Let’s say you took a 15-hr (per week) job making $10/hour. Let’s say you’re at Nebraska and the state/local taxes are low-to-nil, so you’re keeping about $130 of that per week. That comes to about $550 per month (since months average more than four full weeks).
If you adopted a “spend half, save half” mentality, you could:

Spend an average of $65 per week. That could buy you five pizzas, or two pizzas and two movies, or two cheap dates, or one fancy date – every week. You could buy a soda now and then, chips, candy bar, whatever. Aside from adding some “fun/food money” to your college experience, it would also teach you how to plan and execute a budget, which is a valuable thing to learn. A lot of people don’t know how to do that, go into credit card and other types of debt, and it causes major problems.
Save an average of $65 per week. If you are on campus for 34 weeks out of the year, that’s right around $2200 in savings. Or maybe you spend a little less or make a little more money, so you’re saving $2500 per year. At graduation, you’d have $10,000.

That $10,000 is $10,000 worth of access to opportunity and added security. It can help you put down a down payment on a house, it can come in handy if you are out of work for months, you can take a piece of it and do some traveling, etc.

It appears to me that your resources are a ~$5900 Pell Grant + the $5500 student loan. That’s ~$11k. Do you have any schools whose net cost is within your budget? Look carefully at the packages to make sure they’re not already counting Pell and the loan.

U of Michigan is a top ranked university and Ross is one of the top ranked undergrad business programs in the U.S.  U of South Carolina is way, way down the food chain.

Even more risky is to go to a school that you won’t be happy at and a culture in which you won’t thrive.  And only you can make that choice.

"@brantly’s point is equally true for USC.  If you have not been accepted into the HC, then you have not been accepted as pre-IB. (You aren’t even accepted directly into IB.  I think if your GPA drops below a 3.5, IB as a jr is no longer an option.) The IB program is incredibly competitive.  If you aren’t admitted as an incoming freshman, the admissions is fierce and requires a minimum of a 3.6 or 3.7 to even apply.  (I can’t remember exactly.  I sat in on a presentation last yr and the details are fuzzy.  Since it didn’t apply to my dd, it wasn’t a focus.)
To give you an idea, my dd is a Top Scholar who was accepted into pre-IB bc of the HC admissions.  She is also part of one of their cohort students.  She only has until Feb of this yr (freshman) to decide if she wants to stay in the cohort or switch to classic IB.  If she changes her mind March or later that she doesn’t want to be in her cohort, she completely loses her IB spot.

“The University of South Carolina Darla Moore International School of Business is rated number one by all accounts. It is NOT an easy school to get into. Having said that, my best friend son graduated from this school last year. He did an internship at Google in Ann Arbor (yes Google is in Ann Arbor) and was offered employment once he graduated. He was super driven and he did a few abroad studies in Spain, Denmark, and I believe even in Brazil. The school IB department is fabulous and competitive. Having said that, his only REGRET was that he did not go to a higher ranked or overall better named school . The overall Business School is good but not like the IB department and not as selective. At the time he was applying to colleges,USC was the most affordable option and that is where he ended up going. He knows that the fact that he graduated for USC did NOT affect internship or job opportunities. He has done quite well for a 23 year old.”

"I see you have decided, but I do have a comment.  I grew up 30 minutes from Ann Arbor, was a 3rd generation Wolverine, and went to Michigan & Ross.  It felt like a different world, honestly.  I spent time with bright (some brilliant) students and profs from all over the country, and in some cases all over the world.  I was immersed in coursework and opportunities that were nothing like my HS life.  Ann Arbor is a great town to live in the middle of.  My parents tried to give me space, never dropped in unannounced.  I saw HS friends sometimes on campus, but wasn’t obligated to spend time with them if I didn’t want to.
Once I was out of college, the Michigan name opened doors for me, too.  I am in a business where my resume gets reviewed a lot, and I often get, “Michigan —that’s a good school” comments when they get to that part of my resume.
You can move elsewhere after undergrad.  And a Michigan degree makes that easier.
I didn’t love everything about my experience there, but that is more that I might have thrived most at a smaller school.  But I would pick Michigan over South Carolina every single time.

It takes courage at your young age to stand by your conviction and decline acceptance to Ross when overwhelmingly everyone in your life advises you to go to Michigan Ross.

"It appears @pbmcdoug carefully weighed his options and made a thoughtful decision.  I’m sure he’ll be successful regardless of the school he attends.  @intparent There’s more to life than work, money and the ranking and prestige of your alma mater and success isn’t measured by the size of your paycheck or who your work for.  Quality of life matters and a college needs to be a good fit in addition to offering a high quality education.
There’s also a study by a Princeton economist found that the earnings of students from Ivies and students who were accepte at elite schools but chose to attend elsewhere were essentially the same.
""""In 1999, economists from Princeton and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation looked at some of the same data Professor Eide and his colleagues had used, but crunched them in a different way: they compared students at more selective colleges to others of “seemingly comparable ability,” based on their SAT scores and class rank, who had attended less selective schools, either by choice or because a top college rejected them.
The earnings of graduates in the two groups were about the same — perhaps shifting the ledger in favor of the less expensive, less prestigious route. (The one exception was that children from “disadvantaged family backgrounds” appeared to earn more over time if they attended more selective colleges. The authors, Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger, do not speculate why, but conclude, “These students appear to benefit most from attending a more elite college.”)""""

In fact, both of my kids attended schools for fit that weren’t the highest ranked schools they got into.  But Ross is a pretty exceptional school for a BBA, with particularly good opportunities who want to study business.  In this case, I think you WOULD find that Ross graduates earn more if that is the criteria you want to use.  Also, I think the OP has honestly been looking for reasons to not stay close to home – and I think in this case, they are making a mistake.

"As you stated, you can’t go wrong with either P or S. Ultimately, my best advise is to go with your own “gut” feelings.
When my son was making his list of schools to apply to, we had a specific strategy with which then we prioritized based on my son’s desired factors. The first and foremost was the institution’s overall undergraduate quality and experience. While we don’t take any college rankings seriously, it’s really no surprise that Princeton comes in as a perennial #1 at each new publication of the USNWR. Princeton’s students-to-teacher ratio of 5:1 is the best there is. Coupled that with their Preceptorial Method, which is a modified version of the Oxford tutorial, what you have is an outstanding undergraduate learning experience.
By intention, Princeton has set their institutional focus on undergraduate more than graduate students. Their undergraduate population is only 5,232 while the graduate population is 2,747. Stanford, on the other hand, has about 2,000 more undergraduate population than Princeton and about 11,000 graduate population. Again, by institutional design, Princeton doesn’t have Law, Medical and Business schools. Princeton’s endowment per student is also perennially ranked #1 with $2.7M endowment per student, while Stanford is ranked #5 with $1.5M. And Princeton’s alumni giving, an important signifier of undergrad student satisfaction, is also perennially at #1.
Since you mentioned it, HYP has that elite “Ivy League” prestige while Stanford has its own “Stanford prestige.” While Stanford prestige might still grow and no matter how much it could possibly gain with time, it still isn’t the same as the HYP’s Ivy League mystique. And it’s not like HYP and other Ivy League are at stand still while Stanford forges ahead leaps and bounds with prestige-building. It’s not that my son and I don’t like Stanford. When we made a priority list of colleges to apply to, Stanford was 4th on our list after HYP, and that was strictly based on our assessment of undergrad qualities and experiences. My son loves Princeton as the right place to get his undergrad degree while he’s aiming at Stanford as one of top few grad schools to apply to. As an undergraduate-focused institution, my son would rather bet on the institution with 2,000 less undergrad students. Less chance to get lost in the shuffle.
But these remarks are my and my son’s take. Everyone’s needs are different. Ultimately, as I stated at the very beginning, go with your own gut feelings after exhaustively investigating on undergrad quality comparisons. Good luck with your decision making. Either way, you’ll be in a great place.

What I can say is that the undergraduate experience at Stanford has been absolutely amazing for my D and she is 100% certain that she made the right choice in selecting S over H, Y, and P.
My D., a humanities kid through and through, is in SLE – a living/learning program similar to Y’s Directed Studies and P’s HUM Sequence, but better in that it includes a very vibrant residential component: all of her SLE classes take place in the late afternoon at the dorm and discussions continue well into the night. There is resident faculty that lives on site that regularly opens his home to students and puts together events, BBQs, and field trips on what seems to be practically a daily basis. D.'s other classes are outstanding and her profs are exceedingly accessible – not to mention utterly brilliant and tops in their respective fields.
Forget prestige – both schools are prestigious. The bottom line is it comes down to fit: Stanford has a very west coast feel – its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have “[appreciated] the … ‘preppy’ vibe.”
I would have no concerns about Stanford’s undergraduate focus – from what I’ve seen, the school is very invested in creating the best undergraduate experience imaginable for its students.
D’s approach is the opposite of that of @TiggerDad’s son: H, Y, and P will be there for grad school; she sought to select the best possible undergraduate experience in the best possible environment. For D, that was Stanford.

If you were looking at NCAA championships, that’s probably because men’s crew is not an NCAA sport/championship where women’s is.  If other sports are important to the OP, then Stanford will win in almost every list.  PAC 12 sports are fun to watch, fun to follow.  Marching band, cheerleaders, tailgating - all going to be better at Stanford.  Look at the events each crew attends.

"Since you stated that your decision comes down to “athlete life vs. school life,” some questions for you to ask yourself:
Regarding athletic life:
How significant is being an athlete in your life, i.e., is it just for college, post-college, perhaps Olympics, etc.? In other words, is it a short-term or a long-term goal?
Will you be an average or top contributor at P, at S?
Have you done any research on which college supports athletes better adapt to rigorous academic environment? What are their graduation success rate like? (These are available from their respective athletic depts.)
Regarding academic life:
Do you prefer a larger school setting or a smaller LAC-like school? For comparison, Stanford has about 2,000 more undergrad students than Princeton, which has about 5,200. Stanford’s grad student population is about 11,000 whereas Princeton’s grad student population is about half of its undergrad population at 2,700. Stanford has Med, Law and Business schools. By institutional design, Princeton doesn’t. There are pros and cons to either environment, and it’s up to each individual student preference.
What do you intend to major in? Which school has greater strength in your area of academic interest? What resources does each school have for assisting you towards your career path given your major?
What pedagogical style do you prefer? Princeton has the Preceptorial Method which is a modified Oxford tutorial learning environment with 5:1 student-teacher ratio. I’m not as familiar with Stanford’s pedagogical methods, so I’ll leave that for other knowledgeable folks to contribute here.
Princeton has residential college (6) system, and each college where you’d be housed is staffed by 1) the college dean, 2) director of studies, 3) faculty advisers, 4) peer academic advisers and 5) director of student life, a staff member dedicated to support your health and well being. Again, I’m not familiar with Stanford counterpart to this so I’ll leave this up to others to contribute here.
You can’t go wrong with either of these great institutions. However, they’re very different in culture and experience, so do make a wise decision based on YOUR personality and needs. One big mistake I’ve seen so many young students make is going with what their peers think are a greater choice when instead they need to really dig into their self-knowledge of who they’re and what they want to accomplish in life. In other words, DON’T go with either the Ivy hype or the Stanford hype. Go with what’d fulfill your life in the long run.

There will be a lot of athletes at either school, with more at Stanford but perhaps a higher percentage of the student body at Princeton.

A couple of points that may swing in favor of Princeton - one, as someone noted above, Princeton’s campus has more of a classic college feel, in my opinion. And since you’re an athlete, one other thing to consider is that there’s likely to be more travel (plane rides rather than bus rides) and midweek competition at Stanford, as the conference schools (Pac 12 or MPSF, depending on sport) are much more spread out geographically for Stanford than in the Ivy League.

Grad inflation is the least of worries.
D1 rowing is almost a year-around sport. Doing extensive research while competing in and traveling to regattas and practicing  5-7 days/week during the spring, winter and fall is extremely difficult, if not almost impossible.
I realize that research is important when applying to med school. However, I sometimes wonder how important when compared to GPA, MCAT, recommendation letters and reputation of undergrad institution .
I hired a crew coach who had rowed in the first boat at an Ivy.  Although he had a mechanical engineering degree, a few years post graduation he decided he wanted to be a physician.  During the time he coached for our program, he took bio and organic chem the local university and did research. He commented a number of times that had he been required to spend significant amounts of time doing research as an undergrad, rowing would not have been possible.
His MCAT scores were outstanding, but his research wasn’t what most would have considered impressive…at all.
He wasn’t accepted at the top schools he applied to. However, he was accepted at a respectable med school.

While being recruited, it’s important to include this in your conversation with coaches. Are there any majors you can’t do while rowing? I know pre-med is just not an option for athletes at some schools. Be sure to ask those questions.

"@sbballer - When I think of Stanford as being more “laid back”  than Princeton, I am referring to their respective student bodies more than the schools themselves or the amount of work that students have to do at those schools. I was comparing the more quirky and irreverent student body of a place like Stanford, with a definite west cost vibe and lifestyle, and contrasting that with the more east coast, (in my opinion, somewhat more uptight) preppy vibe of a place like Princeton.
This is what I said: """"Stanford has a very west coast feel – its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have “[appreciated] the … ‘preppy’ vibe.”
I cannot comment on the quarter vs. semester system and how that works with athletics, but quarters do move at a fast pace.

"@cllgerower1999 congratulations on your wonderful choices!  I have a kid at an Ivy in a different sport. From California as well and wanted a different culture.  It’s working out ok for him there and the deciding factor was the major, school culture, the team competitiveness and team culture. One thing to seriously consider is the weather especially given that yours is an outdoor sport. My kid would compete in 30-40 degree weather and that was in the spring. Not ideal but it is what it is. The other factor (which may or may not be important to you) is the racial mix of the student body.
You mention you had unforgettable feelings about being on princeton’s campus which is great but you bring up a good point that you’re a teenager and might not trust your feelings. You may have that feeling now but there’s always a honeymoon period then reality sets in once practice and school starts and the grind becomes that…a grind. Your teammmates will really shape your experience during your undergrad much more than anything else.
I’d give the nod to Stanford: prestige, high quality academics, weather and PAC-12 athletics.  Good luck!
P.S. Now that my kid has had some experience as an Ivy athlete coming from another coast, the  drawback has been distance. The lack of family support at meets was evident and the struggle was real.

Ultimately, it’s all a matter of perspective – I grew up in Manhattan, and consider most “metropolitan” regions in CA (except for downtown LA or downtown SF and a few scattered other cities) to be a series of concatenated suburbs, so everything’s relative.

It’s probably easier for some kids to do a ton of PSETs and bang out a bunch of lab reports than it is for them to write a 15-page research paper and vice versa.

Also, bear in mind that there are theses and there are theses. One of the things my D looked at in comparing two schools within a consortium were the quality of the senior theses of each of the schools (they were available online through the library). Overall, there was a significant difference in the length and quality of the work from the students at one school versus the other. She also noted differences in the levels of intellectual curiosity among the student bodies that she perceived inside and outside of the classroom among the many schools she visited.

I was a notorious underachiever that attended one of NYC’s specialized high schools that consistently ranks as being one of the top 10 math-and science schools in the country, managed to graduate magna cum laude from Georgetown University and be admitted to Phi Beta Kappa without producing  a body of work that – at this point in my life – I would consider to be representative of those levels of achievement. My D (who thankfully takes after her father and works at a much higher rigor ceiling than I ever did) has produced far better work than I had ever done as an undergraduate and perhaps even as a graduate school student. I suspect that she would probably work at that level at any school. To quote the Danish prince “[she] could be bounded in a nutshell and count [herself] a king [queen?] of infinite space.” Me?

He practices pretty much year round five days a week. The fall is a bit lighter in intensity than in winter and onward. Many of his teammates including him are stem majors. As for taking some ‘easy’ classes, I don’t think that’s limited to athletes.  I remember choosing some classes based on ‘easy’ status because I worked part time and had other non academic commitments.  My point is that OP should choose his major based on what he loves and would want to pursue as a career, not what will accommodate his sport or be easy to get a degree in because his sport keeps him too busy.

Wrong. If this were true, then UCLA or UCSD would be more rigorous than MIT and Berkeley! Stanford doesn’t cram semester long 15 week courses into 10 week stress filled classes. Typical 3 or 2 class sequence such as intro math (51/52/53) is equivalent to a two semester sequence at Berkeley or MIT. For non sequence classes, the material covered at Stanford is much less than the equivalent one at MIT/Berkeley.

"Congratulations on two great choices. One of the best parts of being a great athlete is having these choices (and decision) early. You are able to relax (while keeping up your training and studies) while everyone else is sweating the college apps and decisions. It’s pretty sweet. It sounds like the only issue with Stanford is being bored with it being familiar.  It is fantastic to be on a winning sports program if you are investing all the time to be part of one. You said Stanford is at the top of the heap. Don’t underestimate how fast training indoors for a west coast athlete can get old. Being part of a huge (not just big) budget athletic program has perks mere mortals never see…higher level of travel comfort, competitive and training opportunities - some in other countries, academic support (a tutor) on the plane with you, as much gear as you can imagine, the best trainers brought in from all over the world, custom footwear - crazy stuff, but things that help you excel as an athlete and student.
You are going to spend a lot of hours with this team and coach (coaches can change, but you likely have general idea of longevity if coach is a fixture there, but certainly the team), do you have a feeling of a fit with the guys/team culture at one or the other? From everything you have said, Stanford has more to offer you except a different coast and new experience. But it could be a new experience that is life changing for the better, or frankly it could be a bust. It is up to you to make either choice the experience you want it to be. It is ok to turn down Stanford, there are plenty of athletes that choose other schools for various reasons that are important to them. It is your life. Just be sure you are doing so based on significant reasons that are important to you. If your gut is not clearly ringing a loud bell then write down what is really important or matters in your choice - academics, athletic prestige, academic prestige, importance of winning, importance of winning level (NCAA Champion potential), coaches, team mates, location, family support nearby, big budget program, weather, size of school, support of athletes - anything at all that matters. Then prioritize them for you. Put the winner in one column and see which school has the most “victories.” Sometimes it is good to separate out factors that are all jumbled in your head and causing confusion. It can help you see what is important to you.
And as a last thought, I always suggest students ask themselves this question…10 years from now, where do you want to say you graduated from?

You can take many ~1 credit PE-type athletic classes at Stanford and I expect the other discussed colleges.  For example, I took weight training and karate for 1 quarter.   Both were 1 credit P/F type classes that required ~2 hours of practice per week.   I don’t see why spending 20+ hours per week of athletic practice in a sport shouldn’t give you at least as much credit as a PE class.  However,  rowing is only a ~1 credit class like PE classes, and most rowers were not eligible at the time I was on the team.  The ~1 credit is little in comparison to the 180 credits required to graduate, and does not at all reflect the many hours of practice and commitment that is required to be on the team.  In my opinion, it’s far more challenging to be a successful student as an athlete than non-athlete.

You are using the slowest version of the lowest possible math sequence as an example.  Most feshmen did single variable calculus in HS and take  more advanced  math sequences that go at a faster pace.  A partial summary of freshmen math options is below.  Note that there a variety of different options for students with different math background/ability/interests, as well as students who are looking to cover the material more rigorously, rather than offering a single level for all students.  I also wouldn’t assume athletes generally choose the lowest level for everything.  I’d expect you are more likely to find premeds in the lowest versions of courses than athletes.
Math 19-21 – 3 quarter version of single variable calculus
Math 41-42 – 2 quarter version of single variable calculus
Math 51-53 – differential and integral calculus in several variables, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations
Math 61-63M – covers the material of the Math 50 series at a much more advanced level with an emphasis on rigorous proofs and conceptual arguments
Math 61-63DM –  covers the same linear algebra material as the Math 60CM series and otherwise focuses on topics in discrete mathematics, algebra, and probability theory at an advanced level with an emphasis on rigorous proofs
I’ve taken classes at a lot of colleges with semester systems including RPI, SUNY, UCSD and UWy.  I found Stanford courses typically to go at a much faster pace, although there was  a significant variation from class to class.

[/quote]

As mentioned in my earlier post, you can either take single variable calculus  in 2 quarters or 3 quarters, depending on which math sequence you choose.  It only shows that you have a choice of whether to pack what some other colleges do in a semester or not.   The 3 course sequence you mentioned includes 3-unit courses, so they are expected to cover less material than typical Stanford/Princeton math classes and contribute less than typical Stanford/Princeton classes towards graduation requirements.  Of course most Stanford students already took single variable calculus in HS.   The more typical higher level math sequences also seem to list more material in  their description for Stanford’s 3 quarters than Princeton’s 2 semesters.  For example Stanford’s quarter length math 51-53 covers multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.  Princeton’s math 201-202 covers multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but not explicitly differential equations.  However, they also may have the equivalent of more units to reflect the increased material.   It’s not as simple as either 3 quarters of material at Stanford = 2 semesters of material elsewhere  or quarter != semester.  It depends on the class, number of units, and often falls somewhere in between those two extremes…
If you want to have a general rule,  it’s been my experience that 3 quarters at Stanford generally covers more material than 2 semesters elsewhere.  Quarter length classes did appear to be equivalent to semester length in some cases, but not all.    However, I haven’t taken classes at Princeton or colleges at that academic level, besides Stanford…

Stanford is better known (and ranked) internationally due to its grad/PhD-level greatness, but you aren’t getting your MBA (P’ton doesn’t have a B school…), JD or PhD – you’re getting your BA or BS. For that, no university is better than Princeton.
If you were interested in Engineering or CS, Stanford has the edge. But Princeton is solid in those things and great at about everything else, and where curriculum is even, Princeton has the edge given the close interaction with your profs. Princeton’s reputational bread is buttered by its undergrads and undergraduate emphasis, and that drives the budgeting and decision-making of the school. The undergrads are #1 there – they have to be, since they comprise nearly 70% of the total student population. Motivation and capacity (largest per-student endowment) equal performance.

Health studies may be a significant difference between S and P.     I believe the closest field at Stanford is Human Biology, which was Stanford’s most popular major until the recent CS boom.   It’s an  interdisciplinary field that lets you design a customized program based on your interests and goals, choosing courses from a good variety of other fields, outside of human biology classes.  Stanford is big on such  interdisciplinary programs like this, coterm degrees that combine BS+MS, etc.  I’m not as familiar with the options at Princeton, but I do see that they offer the option to supplement major with Global Health and Health Policy and obtain a related certification, which Stanford does not have an equivalent…

This brings up another relevant point.    I grew up in upstate NY. I currently live in CA, largely because of the large CA presence at Stanford job fairs, and because I enjoyed the CA area while at Stanford. If you want to live/work/internship in the SV or CA area, Stanford has a strong edge. Similarly, I’m sure the Princeton area has a strong college presence and a large number of area companies with special network/internship areas.

Unless you really want to go for a PhD, going full time to grad school for an MS doesn’t really pay unless you are an International looking for visa status.

You haven’t told us enough about what you mean by “grad school” so we have no way of evaluating whether there’s value in conserving cash for that.  Grad school typically costs little.  Professional school (totally different ballgame) is very expensive.  If you are talking about non-professional grad school, conserving the college fund by going to UMich most likely means that the money would get used for something other than your post-grad education – like a college fund for your siblings or your kids or a house down payment.

The problem with that is that the top tech jobs are in SF, Seattle, and NYC. Students competing for top jobs are not going to the midwest and south.
I believe the Michigan places 1/3 at those 4 firms. There is nowhere you can’t reach from Michigan. I just think that Columbia students are probably placed at higher rates in top positions, and also may be likely to be recruited for other options. Finally, all job at Apple, for example, are not the same. A lot of the people working at the Apple store were CS majors. If the student was imagining being a SWE or a PM, that is a lot different. CS salaries seem to be very sensitive to technical skills and I think Columbia pushes students harder to learn more, and starts with stronger students who probably had more CS experience to start.
Additionally, it is likely that Columbia students are more likely to have internships and job opportunities at companies right in NYC, where Google owns an entire building, Bloomberg hires many, IBM, Palantir, Jane Street etc.
There are also certain positions where a Columbia student would seem to have an advantage of getting included as a candidate. I was talking to a current CS candidate who had a second round tech interview in NYC last week. The person said that there were 6 candidates being interviewed that day, and they were from MIT, Penn, Princeton, Berkeley, and Duke. That has a strong appearance of being a position where the name of the school matters. I do think a Michigan grad can get into that group, but I suspect it would be easier for a Columbia grad. They are both strong brands, but the Columbia brand is very strong in NYC.
I am not saying that Columbia is a clear choice, I just think that it depends on where the student wants to end up. If they want to be in the midwest, I would lean toward Michigan. If they want to be on the east coast, I would lean toward Columbia. If they want to be in Seattle or SF, I think it depends on what the student values.

This is so random it is not even worth discussing. But yes, in NYC, Columbia’s brand exceeds that of Michigan. Then again, it exceeds that of virtually every university in the world save perhaps Harvard, and even that is debatable. But the OP has not indicated that his goal is to live in NYC. In other parts of the country, Columbia’s corporate reputation does not exceed that of Michigan.
When it comes to graduate school or professional placement, Columbia offers no advantage over Michigan. Like I said earlier, when choosing between Michigan and Columbia, one need not concern himself with the quality of those universities since they are roughly equal.

"@alexandre “When it comes to graduate school or professional placement, Columbia offers no advantage over Michigan.”
I am not sure what you are basing that on.
U of M receives limited state money and has to take most of its undergrads from the state of Michigan. Making matters worse, the State of Michigan’s public education is in a death spiral which is making qualified in-state candidates scarce (see link below).
Historically, U of M’s advantages are their strong alumni base, its large endowment, and sports. However, sports seems to be sliding with the football team losing 12 out of the last 13 games to Ohio State and 8 out of the last 10 games to Michigan State.
Given their situation, I don’t see how they can improve their undergrad situation significantly unless the State allows them to go private, which I think is unlikely.

"“You only have to look at the historical slide of public universities compared to private universities (in undergraduate studies) to see it.”
Actually CU, the slide has a lot more to do with data reporting and a terribly flawed methodology than with actual drop in quality. Private universities are making up numbers to help their rankings while public universities cannot because their data are audited for accuracy. Columbia claims to have a 6:1 student to faculty ratio. LOL!    Someone must have forgotten to include the 6,500 thousand graduate students enrolled at Fu and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. in that calculation. That Fu. There are 190 professors. If you just include the 1,600 undergraduate students in the student to faculty ratio calculation, you get a very respectable 8:1 ratio. Now add the 3,100 graduate students enrolled at Fu to the equation, which Columbia conveniently omits, and the ratio swells to 25:1. Columbia also conveniently omits 3,300 graduate students enrolled in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Overall, Columbia’s student to faculty is well over 12:1, and yet it reports a 6:1 ratio.
Those rankings consider faculty salaries in their rankings. Columbia professors (as well as professors in most urban universities) obviously earn significantly more than Michigan professors (and professors in most college towns and rural areas) since the cost of living in NYC far exceeds the cost of living in Ann Arbor. I am not sure how that is a fair comparison.
There are many more inconsistencies and methodology flaws that benefit private universities and hurt public universities. That does not make private universities better than public universities.
“BTW I’m not disparaging UMich by itself, I am disparaging all public unis and its not their fault. It is the fault of the state legislatures by putting these unis in impossible situations by limiting there ability to raise in state tuition, and then cutting their funding.”
Michigan’s financial status is not  common for a public university. Michigan’s endowment stands at $9.6 billion, 8th largest in the nation. With 50% of its undergraduate students coming from OOS, most of which pay full tuition, Michigan has a very healthy tuition income stream.
“This inevitably leads to ever increasing enrollments and class sizes without the appropriate increase in professors and resources which leads to publics falling further behind privates as the privates simply don’t have these constraints.”
Private universities do not have financial constraints? With the exception of Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Stanford, I would say most private universities have financial constraints. Columbia’s financial position is no better than Michigan’s.

I am basing it on the fact that according to academe, Columbia and Michigan are considered peer institutions. Over 200 Michigan undergrads are admitted into Michigan’s top ranked graduate professional programs annually, and many more are admitted into other top graduate programs around the nation. When it comes to professional placement, there are plenty of reports that show that Michigan is very well recruited. Columbia does not publish placement data, but Penn does. Last year, 36 Michigan engineering/CS graduates were hired by Google, compared to 19 Penn engineering/CS graduates. Another 33 Michigan engineering and CS graduates were hired by Apple compared to just 3 Penn engineering/CS graduates. 41 Michigan engineering/CS majors were hired by Microsoft, compared to 10 Penn engineering/CS graduates. 49 Michigan engineering/CS majors were hired by Amazon, compared to 6 Penn engineering/CS majors. In total, 149 Michigan engineering/CS graduates were hired by those four Tech giants, compared to 38 Penn engineering/CS graduates. I am not sure what more proof you want that Michigan does just as well as schools like Columbia and Penn when it comes to placement.
But like I said, there are several sources that seem to think that Michigan holds its own, at least with tech firms are concerned:

“U of M receives limited state money and has to take most of its undergrads from the state of Michigan. Making matters worse, the State of Michigan’s public education is in a death spiral which is making qualified in-state candidates scarce (see link below).”
First of all, the University of Michigan no longer takes most of its undergraduate students from the state of Michigan. Last Freshman class was roughly 50% OOS. Secondly, while many public high schools in Michigan are not doing well, the ones that feed into Michigan are doing just fine. Second, Michigan receives $300 million from the state annually. While that is by no means enough on its own, when you combined it with its considerable endowment and the money Michigan generates from tuition thanks to its large OOS student body, the University is perfectly fine.
“Historically, U of M’s advantages are their strong alumni base, its large endowment, and sports. However, sports seems to be sliding with the football team losing 12 out of the last 13 games to Ohio State and 8 out of the last 10 games to Michigan State.”
What does football have to do with anything? Michigan is, first and foremost, one of the most intellectually supercharged communities in the country. Both Ann Arbor (which has the highest percentage of college education residents than any city in the US) and the University have an incredibly vibrant intellectual feel. Michigan is known for that. Michigan is also known for its very well rounded academic excellence. In fact, it is arguably the most well rounded academic institution in the country. Michigan is ranked among the top 15 in virtually every single field of study, and among the top 10 in most, including Business, Law and Medicine, as well as most traditional disciplines, such as English, History and Mathematics. In Anthropology, the Classics, Engineering, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology and Sociology, Michigan is among the top 5 nationally. Michigan is also known as a medical center, and its hospital is considered one of the top 10 in the nation. So to suggest that Michigan is mostly known for football is a crude statement. That may be true of the uneducated masses, but then again, in those circles, most universities are not even recognized. But if you are insinuating that’s Michigan’s alumni are only loyal to the University if the football program is winning, you are mistaken. Michigan raised more from its alumni this year than it ever has. Michigan alumni are loyal to the university regardless of its football record.
But putting its record vs OSU and MSU aside, which is difficult considering how lopsided it has been, Michigan football is still doing well. It had back to back 10-3 seasons in 2015 and 2016, finishing #11 in the nation in 2015 and #10 in 2016. In 2015, two of Michigan’s three losses were by 7 points or less, and they beat Florida 41-7 at the Citrus Bow. In 2016, Michigan lost 13-14 at Iowa, 27-30 in double overtime at OSU and 32-33 against Florida State at the Orange Bowl. 9 of Michigan’s 10 wins in 2016 were by 9 points or more This year was supposed to be a rebuilding year, with 11 players drafted by the NFL last year. Still, the team is 4-1 (including a 33-17 win against Florida) and ranked #17 in the nation. Its four wins were all by a 16 point margin or better. While Michigan is struggling on offense this year, the Defense is ranked #1 in the nation. Another 10-3, top 10 season is certainly possible. Michigan also recruited back to back top 10 classes. I would say the future of Michigan football is looking good.
“Given their situation, I don’t see how they can improve their undergrad situation significantly unless the State allows them to go private, which I think is unlikely.”
Michigan’s situation is good. The University is in very high demand as is evidenced by the annual increase in its applicant pool and 45% yield rate despite not enjoying the benefits of Early Decision admissions. Its endowment is one of the largest and growing by a healthy margin. The alumni are very loyal. Ann Arbor is a very nice college town.

"""""This is fact, not opinion, state colleges are woefully underfunded by states and not allowed to raise in-state tuition, so they increase the student body size. Doesn’t matter what any ranking says, this is a deteriorating situation.
Alexandre, do you deny this?""""
CU123, many state universities are hurting, just as many private universities are hurting. But we are not discussing public universities on this thread. This thread is about Michigan. Michigan is not hurting. Financially, Michigan is doing very well. The University’s endowment has at the fastest pace of any university in the nation between 1990 and today. In 1989, Michigan’s endowment was not even among the top 30 in the nation. Today, it is the 8th largest. In 2009, in the midst of the financial meltdown, Michigan spent $100 million to buy Pfizer’s global research HQ campus, made up of some 25 buildings and over 2 million square feet of lab space. Naturally, all universities save HYPS can use more money, and Michigan is no exception, but Michigan is very well off…as well off as Columbia.
To address your question, yes, I deny this. According to its CDS, Michigan’s student body in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has indeed increased from 33,481 in 2007 to 38,076 in 2016. But the size of its instructional faculty in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has also increased from 2,063 in 2007 to 2,583 in 2016. The student to faculty ratio has remained steady at 15:1. So yes, I deny it, and I have the facts to prove it.

http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2016-2017_umaa.pdf (Section I2)
But tell me again, how do you justify Columbia’s shameless claim that it has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when it omits 6,500 graduate students from its calculation? Oh, that’s right, Columbia does not publish a CDS report. In fact, it is the only Ivy League institution that doesn’t. But one thing is clear, Columbia is omitting 6,500 graduate students from its student to faculty ratio and that puts into serious question its ethical practices, as well a the integrity of the data it publishes. Columbia’s actual student to faculty ratio would likely double if it were being honest, and its ratio would be 12:1 rather than 6:1. But that would mean a drop in the rankings, so obviously, Columbia and its private peers have little incentive to be honest. And what of the very flawed rankings methodology? Do you deny that private universities are gaming the rankings and that the methodology is seriously flawed?

This thread has gotten way too sidetracked. Michigan is the obvious choice when it’s so economically superior and arguably better in the subject being studied as a major. Michigan may not have all the qualities of an ivy, but in no way do those make up a difference of 100K or more.

The 6,000 undergraduate students (I am fairly certain it is closer to 8,000 when you include General Studies) still have to share the faculty and resources with those 23,000 graduate students. At any university, undergraduate students do not exist in a vacuum. I don’t see how there’s any difference CU123. Columbia has limited resources, and 31,000 students to look after. Your facts are not convincing at all. A university’s endowment is shared by all of its students, graduate and undergraduate, not just by the undergraduate students. Same with a university’s faculty.
If anything, I have provided more facts. Where are the placement figures for Columbia that show that Columbia places more graduates in Silicon Valley? I have shown how many Michigan graduates are placed in major tech firms, and I even provided comparative data from Penn. Sadly, Columbia does not publish such data. Where are the peer ratings that prove that Columbia is a far superior university to Michigan? According to the US News Peer Assessment score, Columbia’s rating hovers between 4.6 and 4.7, while Michigan’s hovers between 4.4 and 4.5. That makes them peers in the eyes of university presidents, deans of undergraduate colleges and provosts. And how do you prove that Columbia has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when Fu has a 25:1 ratio and the 4,500 College students share their faculty with 3,500 Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences? Those are the facts I want addressed…and they are facts.
I am still waiting for the evidence to support your claim that Columbia is a vastly superior university to Michigan to the extent that it is insulting to you that one would even suggest that they are peer institutions.

"I have seen both the universities from very close quarters. The family has strong connection with both CU and Michigan. Children attended thses schools, though not CS, and are doing well. We often have similar discussions at home now that the fourth generation is entering the colleges. I will write what all of you know, but are debating based on personal preferences and bias.

In terms of placement, Michigan is pretty good. CU is equally good,could be better in programs offered in liberal science and arts.
The top tech companies, are not so concerned about the Ivy Tag, and will recruit the best irrespective of the brand. Just not Michigan or Berkeley, even UIUC, Georgia Tech, UT Austin are very favourite grounds of the top tech companies.
Many of the lead recruiters are not from Ivy League and have firsthand experience of students coming from public or non-ivy private universities.
It is true many parents would like to see their children attending Ivy league or top private universities over top public universities. It is based on the value that we attach to a brand that fits into overall public perception.
Good students excel any way and the decision of the schools they attend is also based on the cost of attendance and other preferences, be it place, sports, music, culture. My grand nephew preferred Northwestern over Columbia because he felt the Evanston campus will provide him with better college experience that the CU campus. Very personal and I don't think, we can say whether he was right or wrong.
Lots of statistics are being dished out. In my opinion, these things are not the core reasons for choosing the place for undergraduate education.

I don’t think that’s a fair assumption. Cornell and Penn have much better CS reputation in my experience, and Penn benefits from overrepresentation in the financial sector, even within tech.
I think calling Michigan a top 5 school for CS is a reach, but I think it’s safely a top 15 CS school. I don’t think you can say the same about Columbia.
The 5th in CS reputation is hotly debated on CC - I don’t think going down this road accomplishes anything.

"“I have no doubt that the best Michigan students can compete with anyone and can command salaries in the $110k - $150k range. However, I suspect that the average and below average Michigan students may not be so competitive and that may bring their average down.”
Much2learn, the range of Michigan students enrolled in the CoE is similar to the students enrolled at Cornell or Penn. There is no difference in the quality of the students. There may have been a slight difference in quality in the 90s and 00s, but the gap has closed entirely in recent years.
There are simple reasons for the small gap in starting pay.
First of all, Cornell’s data is for 2017, while Penn and Michigan’s reports are for 2016 graduates. That alone accounts for a 3%-4% difference in pay.
Second, the makeup of the students in the engineering programs. For example, at Michigan, most engineering students (over 70%) major in Aerospace, Civil, Chemical, Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical etc…Those aren’t the highest paid Engineering disciplines. At Penn, roughly 50% major in CS, CE-related majors, which pay significantly more. In this regard, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of majors than Penn, which seems to lean heavily on CS/CE majors.
But even then, the advantage when it comes to placing graduates in companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft clearly favors Michigan, even over the likes of Cornell:
Michigan: 149
Penn: 39
Cornell: 38
Michigan is obviously twice larger than Cornell and three times larger than Penn (although Penn has roughly almost as many CS/CE majors as Michigan), but advantage in the number placed in those tippy top Tech firms clearly favors Michigan.
Third, while many CS majors end up in Silicon Valley, the majority, certainly over 50%, will work regionally. For example, according to Penn’s report, close to 60% of Penn graduates took jobs in the Mid Atlantic (DC to NYC) and Northeast (mostly Boston). In the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly  lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living. Since 50%-60% of the graduates work and live regionally, it stands to reason that those take jobs in the most expensive region will have higher starting salaries.  That can easily account for the 15% gap between Michigan (and other Midwestern schools like Northwestern and UIUC) and East Coast universities (like Cornell and Penn).
Below are the average starting salaries Engineering/CS graduates:
Cornell: $79,000
Michigan: $76,000
Northwestern: $70,000
Penn: $88,000

OP – recognize that the average college student changes majors three times while in school.  So there’s a good chance that all the fighting over  Columbia’s CS program vs UM’s CS program will be irrelevant to you.  Since you may wind up studying something completely different.
If price is an object, most everyone would pick UM in-state over Columbia.  If price is no object, most people would pick Columbia over UM.
According to you, price is no object.  So pick the school you like better – UM and CU are going to be VERY different animals in terms of your college experience.

I am merely stating a statistical reality. If you look at average starting salaries at Cornell, Michigan, Northwestern or Penn, there is an increase of 3%-4% annually. For example, the average Penn starting salary for the SEAS in 2012 was $69,000, 2013 was $72,000, 2014 was $75,000, in 2015 was $83,000 and in 2016 was $88,000. Since Cornell’s report is for 2017 graduates, while Michigan’s and Penn’s report is for 2016 graduates, the comparison isn’t entirely fair.
“Also failing to normalize for size, UMich has 5 times as many engineering students as Penn. that would put Penn at nearly 200 vs 149 for UMich after a simple normalization…”
Penn lists 68 CS majors out of the 177 who reported their placement and salaries from the SEAS at Penn, compared to 110 CS majors out of the 406 who reported their placement and salaries from the CoE  at Michigan. So it is nowhere near five times more. Like I said, Michigan’s College of Engineering (roughly 6,500 undergraduate students) is 4 times larger than Penn’s SEAS (close to 1,700 undergraduate students, so not 5 times larger), but when it comes to CS majors, Michigan and Penn have roughly the same numbers. As I stated above, Cornell, Michigan and Northwestern have a more balanced concentration of engineering majors than Penn, which seems to focus disproportionately in CS/CE.  Even if you adjust for size, Michigan places a significantly higher number of graduates as Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft than Penn.

I agree that the mix of majors is an issue. I was only looking at Computer Science.
For a ME, EE, ChemE, choosing Michigan over an Ivy if it is cheaper seems to be more clear cut for most students. The pay range is much smaller for these majors and the related jobs.
“But even then, the advantage when it comes to placing graduates in companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft clearly favors Michigan, even over the likes of Cornell”
These 4 companies seem to be the focus of Michigan graduates. I think a lot of grads at Ivies have those options too, but may simply decide that other offers are better for them. Those 4 are not necessarily superior to other options: Facebook, AirBnB, Lyft, Bloomberg, Jane Street, D. E. Shaw, Drop Box, Palantir, etc.
I think the better job depends on many factors: the specific duties, compensation, location, etc.
“In the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living.”
I don’t understand this. I don’t think that many top CS jobs exist in the midwest that would be comparable to SF, NYC, Seattle, or Boston. There are probably a reasonable number of comparable positions in Chicago, and I am sure there are a few startups in Ann Arbor, but if a large number of CS students are staying in Michigan, then I would think that suggests that they are not getting similar positions.

I didn’t see a huge difference in CS (90K for UM, 100K for Penn?) which is the major we’re discussing.  So lot will depend on the respondents as well, Cornell only had 114 respondents (119 responded but five didn’t answer a lot of the questions it looked like) so that’s not a huge response rate.  Maybe those that didn’t have great salaries decided not to report.  Also you’re assuming that everyone is honest in these things.
Second, you have stock options that will lower the starting salary in companies, esp in tech.  Grads will take a lower salary if it means 500 Google stock vesting over 4 years.  Also Google I believe sets salary on how well you do in your interview, so once you get an interview, if you’re a SJSU grad (and there are a lot of those at Google and Apple), you can do better wrt compensation than an ivy leaguer if you have a superb interview.
And you’re comparing Michigan to Cornell and Penn, who have better engineering and comp sci programs than Columbia.  That’s not as straightforward a comparison as UM and Columbia, where UM has the clear edge.  Cornell and Penn have the two best engr/cs programs in the ivies and would be in the second set of schools I mentioned.  I have actually met grads from those schools out here :-).

"These 4 companies seem to be the focus of Michigan graduates. I think a lot of grads at Ivies have those options too, but may simply decide that other offers are better for them. Those 4 are not necessarily superior to other options: Facebook, AirBnB, Lyft, Bloomberg, Jane Street, D. E. Shaw, Drop Box, Palantir, etc.
I think the better job depends on many factors: the specific duties, compensation, location, etc.""""
Much2learn, I agree that other companies may offer more appealing alternatives, although I am not sure that those companies are hiring any fewer Michigan graduates vis-a-vis graduates from other top universities. For example, Michigan grads still do better with some of those secondary companies you mentioned, including Facebook, which hired more Michigan grads (12) than Cornell (fewer than 5) and Penn (2).
Location, as you point our, plays a major role here. That is why many graduates end up working in their respective regions. It is difficult for many graduates from schools like Michigan and Northwestern to accept jobs on the West Coast or East Cost because that would mean going far from home. Many would rather take good jobs locally, or regionally.
That being said, I do not think the pay gap is sufficient to make any assumptions or draw any conclusions. The Michigan average starting pay for a CS major is $94,000, vs $101,000 for a Penn CS major. That $7k gap could well be explained by a variety of reasons/factors, including regional pay differences and relative differences in variable pay (stock options etc…).

You need to maybe stop with parchment and usnews (and other) rankings and maybe give better advice than look at the rankings for your decision.  In this case that would be a disservice, a serious one,  A CS major will be a fish out of water at Columbia but will be right at home at Michigan, access to labs, research, a technology culture that’s not reflected in rankings.

Management is a career track. It depends on your performance at work over time, not on the college you attended.

As for switching majors, you may do so at both Columbia  and Michigan, and still go on to have an excellent education regardless since both universities are excellent across virtually all disciplines.

It’s nowhere near that simple. The strength of preference is an important consideration, as is where the 180K goes if they do not spend it. If I as the student got to keep that 180K for post-grad to invest or buy a house or a car or get ahead in various ways financially, Columbia is in no way worth it. If that 180K means my parents can retire two or three years earlier, that’s a consideration as well. It’s a conversation to have with them.

Lots of students want to continue their sport in college, and compete at the DIII level because it is something they love and are good at.  I think it is perfectly legitimate to want to swim in college.  BUT… I do agree that having it as a driver for where to apply is maybe short sighted.  As @Corbett says, neither is ideal for what the OP wants.  Honestly, I suspect it would be grueling to keep the needed GPA for med school at Amherst as well (not quite as much as Mudd, but still super challenging – not much time for anything but sport and studying).  I also think Swarthmore is a risky choice – again, VERY difficult academically (my kid picked Mudd over Swat, but liked both because she wanted the highest level of academic intensity she could find).  I wouldn’t pick a top 5 LAC in general to do a sport and pre-med – stiff competition for the grades you need there.

"Harvey Mudd has a core curriculum that covers many of the pre-med course requirements; the remaining ones can be taken as electives, regardless of major.  However, the academic intensity is high (regardless of major), and the large core curriculum (including HSA requirements) means that cherry picking courses that you are most likely to get A grades in is more difficult.
In contrast, Amherst has no general education requirements, which means that you can cherry pick courses that you are most likely to get A grades in to boost your GPA for pre-med purposes.  But there is no native engineering degree program.
You can do pre-med as an engineering major at many schools, but the high volume of non-overlapping requirements for most types of engineering and pre-med course requirements can make it difficult to fit all of the course work into four academic years of normal course loads.  Adding intercollegiate athletic workload makes that even more difficult.

I would just advise the OP that a promise of support from Coach Nichols at Amherst is worth a heck of a lot more than a promise of support at HM. As you point out, Nichols gets his guys admitted. HM and the other Claremont McKenna colleges have a reputation for over-promising to prospective athletes on occasion — the process of athletic support has been in place much longer and is more established in the NESCAC. And, of the five schools in the consortium, Harvey Mudd is the one LEAST interested in sports and in supporting athletes at admission. If you were truly driven to study Engineering, then I’d encourage you to assume a bit more risk and apply ED to Harvey Mudd. But given your ambivalence, I think you have to factor in the difference in coach support between the two schools (and more generally between the NESCACs and the five colleges of the consortium) and go with the bird-in-the-hand, Amherst. I’d hate to see you lose the nearly certain ED admission at Amherst and then fail to secure admission at HM. After the ED round, you’d be SOL at Amherst. Coach support in the NESCAC works only in the ED round.
If you do decide to apply ED at HM, I’d encourage you to line up support for EDII. Middlebury could help you there. And you’d really like Coach Rueppel.

"“Getting into a college where your admission is questionable to start with, and adding the pressure of athletics in top of that is not a recipe for getting the necessary grades for me school.”
I’m surprised that an experienced CC poster would make that statement in reference to top LACs, @intparent. Admission to Amherst or HM is “questionable” for virtually everyone. The admission rates at those schools are in the mid-to-low teens, and even extraordinarily well prepared students are rejected by the hundreds every year. Additionally, nearly half of the students at these top LACs are varsity athletes. Are you really suggesting that these talented young people can’t handle sports and a pre-med major? Most would find that proposition laughable – my own son among them.
Now if you’re talking about DI athletics at the Big Ten or SEC level, then you may have a point. But these are D3 programs that work extraordinarily hard to create an environment where student athletes can flourish. And they do – often while juggling pre-med courses.

"I agree that admissions to those schools are very selective, and the OP may be as qualified as any other applicant.  But SOMETIMES athletic recruits are in the lower end of the applicant pool in terms of test scores and or grades.  They are hooked, so can get a slight edge there.  If the OP falls in that category, honestly, and wants to get the grades needed for med school, it might not be the best choice to be competing against (1) students with somewhat higher academic qualifications, and (2) students who don’t have the same commitment to a time intensive EC.
I suspect it is easier at Amherst than Mudd.

This isn’t an exaggeration.  My kid worked insanely hard just to pass her classes there.  No way could she have stacked a sport on top of it (and her GPA was still not med-school worthy).  Her friends who were athletes really struggled to keep up, too.  Mudd is a great school.  But it is not a great place for pre-meds to start with.
Most schools have some students in premed who don’t do much but study.  There is something to be said for going to a slightly easier school if that is you chosen path so you can keep the needed GPA.

"@intparent – Yes, that all makes sense. I""""m sure there are special cases – even at D3 – where it would be very difficult for a student athlete to juggle their sport plus pre-med (or Engineering). And it doesn’t surprise me that Harvey Mudd might be one of those special cases. It’s exceptionally rigorous. But Williams, Amherst, CMC, Pomona, Middlebury – these are schools where the large pluralities of the students are varsity athletes, and most chose D3 just so that they could find the right balance between sport and school. And, by all accounts, most do that very well.

"From your comments above, I feel like a few things should be clarified around financial aid.  Unless you are a US citizen, likely Amherst is the only school on your list that will “meet need” for you.  There are only 5 schools in the US that are need blind and meet need for internationals, and Amherst is on that list. Mudd (and Swat) are not.  I know for a fact that Mudd is very specific in saying this to international students that you very likely will NOT get your full need met.  I think Swat will be the same.  You mentioned being need blind above –  that means a college won’t reject your application because you need FA, but it has nothing to do with whether they will offer enough aid for you to attend.
Also, I get the impression you want to go to med school in the US.  There are a small number of med schools in the US that treat Canadians like US citizens in admission, but nearly all consider them international.  It is extremely hard for international students to gain admission to US med schools (and to finance that education).  I’d suggest you research that further before embarking on that path.

"@CCThunderfin – Sounds like you’ve got this all well in hand. Yes, my son is a swimmer at Williams and loves it. Of the NESCAC schools we visited, I liked all of them – Williams, Amherst, Middlebury, and Bowdoin. The coaches were terrific at each school. We really liked Swarthmore, too, and the new coach there, Karin Colby, was terrific. But we shied away from Swarthmore for the same reason you mentioned – the academic environment seemed a bit intense. Of course, Williams and Amherst are pretty intense, too, but Swarthmore does have a special reputation in that regard. My sense is that Harvey Mudd shares that reputation.
It sounds like you’ve gotten the assurances you need at HM – that your odds of admission are very good. But, as for Engineering, my own personal experience is that there is no undergraduate major more intense. Those who choose that major learn a lot, get a strong degree, and find work. But they don’t have much fun in college. If you’re shying away from Swarthmore because of its academic intensity, then I’d suggest you keep in mind that an Engineering major at HM would be VERY intense – probably much more than most students at Swarthmore experience. Pre-med at Amherst would be intense but manageable. Of course, I’m just “some guy” with an opinion, but I’d encourage you to give this Engineering some additional thought. I’ve had a dozen or more friends who attempted Engineering in college quickly move on to something else. Even our valedictorian was pulling very low grades at Notre Dame while attempting Engineering – moved on to something else after the first year and found success. And if you ran into trouble with Engineering at Harvey Mudd, I’m not sure what your other options would be. One last plug – the NESCAC appears to be a terrific place to swim. And Amherst is a great college town, among the best in the US. If you do apply to Amherst, there’s no harm in reaching out to Rueppel and asking if he would support you for EDII.
As for whether to attend a top school for med school, you’ll get lots of opinions here on CC. Some suggest that it doesn’t matter AT ALL where you go – so long as you have the GPA and the MCAT scores. My sense is that these elite LACs are great places to go pre-med. And if you succeed, you’ll have your pick of top medical schools. And if you don’t succeed – or simply change your major as a great many do – you’ll still graduate from one of the top colleges in the country (with a terrific education), and you’ll have wonderful options going forward.

"Re: Post 10, although HM is not interested in sports, the teams are a combination of HM, CMC, and Scripps. The CMS teams are very focused on athletics at this time. For the first time ever, I believe they were in the top five of the Director’s Cup, which is the overall athletic ranking for D3.

Amherst doesn’t have EDII. Just ED and RD.
It does have an excellent record with med school placement and very individualized med/health advising. It doesn’t screen applicants for committee letters and supports all of them even if they don’t make what it considers to be “likely admit” MCAT and GPAs.
But the question of Canadian vs US med schools is definitely important to look into. If it will be really hard to get into a US Med school as a Canadian citizen, you may be better off applying to Canadian med schools and that might or might not mean applying from a Canadian undergrad.
Many students who think they want to be pre-med change their minds, and not necessarily because it’s “too hard”, but because they discover related careers that they didn’t know about that require fewer years of education, pay well and are better fits.
I’ll also add that Amherst’s recent study of its athletics program, just completed this year, found that few varsity athletes major in the sciences. As a pre-med you have something like 7 required science courses with labs, so this may be something to look at - can you make time for the work and the required labs and still compete on the team?  Some can and do, but fewer than non-athletes.

"Three of my personal favorite NESCACS. Can’t go wrong! Each is a little different, and take my impresions with a grain of salt as they are subjective of course. I think (overall) all three schools are pretty equal in your academic areas of interest- some might be stronger than others in certain areas but overall it’s relative as all three are top notch schools.
Bates- wonderful community. Gorgeous (although small) campus/architecture. Very friendly vibe, students are welcoming and the close knit community feel is palpable. Strong academics, just a lovely school. Has the month long May plan which is useful for starting summer internships early or for traveling abroad. Major difference to me between it and the other two is a more laid back vibe. Doesn’t feel as intense. Definitely collaborative. Best food of the three. Nephew is a current student. D15 would have applied regular decision if her ED school had fallen through. Bates is very high on D18’s list this year.
Bowdoin- neat school. Lovely campus in it’s own quirky way. Location near Portland is nice, it is more suburban than rural if that matters to you. Great if you like the ocean. Pretty far away from mountains though if you like having them in your back yard. Of course great academics. Personally, I sensed a little more academic elitism at Bowdoin than the other three. I don’t mean it in a bad way, and perhaps I have used the wrong word. Just seemed a little bit more academcially snobby than the other two. Not sure how collaborative/competitive, don’t know enough kids who go there.  D15 liked Bowdoin a lot, would have applied if her ED school fell through. D18 didn’t even look at Bowdoin, too intense of a school for her.
Middlebury- awesome location in the mountains, lovely campus. Feels considerably bigger than the other two schools. D15 went ED and attends. Loving her expereince, it is the right mix of academic intensity and fun for her. Raves about (most) of the professors/classes she has taken. Has found Midd more collaborative than competitive (she is env policy major). Heavily involved in the Mountain Club. Knows women on the cross country/track team and they are a great group.

I would question whether there is really any discernible difference between Bowdoin, Midd, and Williams on the “laid-back vs. cut-throat” scale.  Williams might have slightly higher stats, but not by much. Bates might be a little further towards the laid-back end of the scale.

Bowdoin or Bates would offer more non outdoorsy activities than Midd. That is in part due to locatIon.

This is a point where there actually would be a discernible difference. Williamstown MA is even smaller than Middlebury VT, and offers even fewer non-outdoorsy activities. Williams is arguably at the far end of the “outdoor vs. indoor activities” scale.

"@joy12345 my daughter has never felt an elitist vibe at Middelbury. Her friend group is geographically pretty diverse, and generally speaking (at least from her experience) students really don’t know/care who is full pay or who gets financial aid. Of course there are always exceptions at every school but middkids are a prety down to earth group.  I do, however, agree with @doschicos that Bates is arguably the most laid back of the three you are considering.
On a side note- when my daughter visited Williams she spent the day on campus. Attended class, danced in the studio, tried to take in as much as possible. She did feel the environment was intense at Williams, that it had a similar feel to Swarthmore, and for that reason Williams did fall off of her list. At Middlebury the students seemed like they were having fun; at Williams not so much that particular day. Having said that, she has two friends at Williams and they absolutely love Williams!
Bottom line is that all three are great school and the comparisons are truly relative and certainly subjective

"I live in NC and NCSU is a fine school (especially for STEM) and a really wonderful campus for me. However it is not particularly flexible for majors since you have to apply to the particular school you want to major in, and it is pretty focused once you are in it (ex. in the engineering school your first year courses are pretty much entirely for that major, so if you wanted to switch to polysci sophomore year, you’d not only have to switch schools but be behind). For an undecided person, this could be a problem, combined with the low availability of aid for OOS students.
On the other hand, NC State is bigger and has lots of major choices and social scenes. Raleigh is also an incredible location both for fun and for jobs/internships. Syracuse is much more difficult to get into, even being OOS for NCSU. I don’t know much about the flexibility of Syracuse.

This really isn’t a matter of opinion. I can’t imagine any sane person preferring Chicago weather.
UChicago is quite strong in political science. Stanford may be even stronger, but not by obvious leaps and bounds for undergraduates. For social science overall, UChicago is one of the strongest research universities in the world. Undergraduate instruction in UChicago’s social science and humanities Core classes, which take up about 1/3 of the college  program, is about as good as you’re likely to find anywhere (in terms of course content, class size, and instructor quality.)

Stanford is filled with entrepreneurial, driven, type-A personalities, tempered a bit by the mild weather.  Chicago is filled with introverted scholars who don’t work hard/party hard.  They just work hard.  The stereotype of Chicago as “where fun goes to die” is overstated but not without some truth.  No one should go to Chicago unless they’re prepared for the intensity.  The academics are intense, the weather is intense, the students are intense.  It requires a certain mindset in order to thrive there.  You really have to be happy with your nose in a book all the time.  Stanford, on the other hand, is a little less classically egghead.  The students are all extremely talented but the overall vibe of the place is mellower and the pace is a bit slower.  You’re more likely to find big house parties, sports mania, rah rah stuff at Stanford.  Either one will put you in good stead for grad/prof school or employment.

Just looking at an average is very misleading, the monthly average high doesn’t dip below 58 degrees in Palo Alto, whereas in Chicago there are five months where the average high is below 50 (cold for us Californians).  PA is more moderate, so the average of 58 means typically highs of 65 lows of 50.  Chicago has an average temp of 50 but more variation. like highs of 80 in the summer and 20’s in the winter.   There are only a few days in Palo Alto where you’d need a light jacket for the cold.  Typically you only need one when it rains.

"I used to live in Montreal, have relatives who went to McGill, and now live in Massachusetts. So why not, here is my take on your questions and issues:


Fees: In general education in Canada is usually much less expensive than in the US. This can differ in specific cases but apparently this is your experience also. Getting more financial aid in the US but having it still cost more is perfectly normal.


Reputation- McGill has a very strong worldwide reputation. Mount Holyoke is a good school.


Masters (MA/MBA) prospects- This probably depends more on your grades that anything else. See 11 below… However, McGill does have a wide range of Master’s and Doctorate programs.


Job Prospects- Depends widely on what you study, how you do, and where you want to work. You mentioned that you have never been to Canada nor to the US. If you are not a US citizen nor permanent resident, then getting a visa to work in the US after graduation is unlikely. If you get a 3 or 4 year degree from McGill, this entitles you to get a 3 year work visa for Canada (but not for the US).


Internship opportunities- Mount Holyoke is sort of in the middle of nowhere, which makes me wonder what would be around (there are a couple of nice small towns nearby, but not much in the way of large businesses). McGill is in the center of a large city, and quite near the business center of the city. I am not sure about visa requirements in either case.


Courses offered- Obviously McGill is very good at a very wide range of subjects. I am not sure about taking classes between faculties there. I have heard that McGill students can also take occasional courses at Concordia (a slightly larger nearby university, the only other English university in Montreal), but I don’t know details.


Adjusting-? I’m an international student who has been struggling with some mental health issues. Too much socializing scares me, but I can definitely strike up a convo/get to know people.


McGill is a large university which tends to treat you as an “adult”, which means that support is minimal and you have to go looking for it. If you are not doing well and you don’t ask for help, they no one is going to come find you. Mount Holyoke is a very different environment but I don’t know as much about this.

Extra Curriculars- ? No sports. Singing, dancing, debating, volunteer work, etc

I am not sure that I understand your comment. McGill has sports, singing, small music events almost every night (for example, students in their excellent music school give concerts), and pretty much anything else that you would want to look for. I recall on our last visit an informal hockey game being played on an outdoor rink on the campus (I am pretty sure that the rink disappears and becomes lawn in the spring). You don’t have to partake in any of it if you don’t want to.
I might note that the drinking age in Montreal is 18. Some allege this makes drinking on campus less bothersome, because it brings the drinking students out of their dorms and into the bars, where they are less willing to embarrass themselves and also where they are less annoying to anyone who didn’t walk into the same bar. Drinking age in Massachusetts is 21.


Weather- Montreal winters are fine most of the time, but there will be a few very cold snaps. When you are out of the wind it should be ok. Mount Holyoke will also have “real” winters, but not quite as cold. My wild guess is that there might actually be very slightly more snow in Mount Holyoke, but there will be plenty of snow in either location.


Housing- I would love to stay in an apartment (which I will have to do from McGill 2nd yr) but i don’t know if it takes up too much study time.


There are a lot of apartments very close to McGill, and a lot more one or two or three subway stops away. The McGill students seem to do fine with it. Housing in Montreal is relatively moderate in price. I might add that the crime rate will be very low at either school.

I want to do well academically.

Here is a big difference. McGill will be VERY challenging academically. The top universities in Canada, particularly McGill and Toronto, compared to top universities in the US are easier to get into but once there harder to graduate from. You will need to work very hard there, and put in very long hours. If you are very smart and work very hard then you can learn an enormous amount at McGill from professors who really know their stuff. But, this is important: YOU HAVE TO WANT TO DO IT. It is very hard to get an A at McGill.
In comparison, Mount Holyoke will not be as academically challenging. It will still be academically very good but it will be easier to get an A (or all A’s).
One question: Which will make it easier to go to graduate school? It is hard to say. If you get straight A’s at McGill, then this will be impressive even to the top graduate schools in the US and elsewhere. However, this will be very difficult (or impossible) to do. For most people, getting A’s at Mount Holyoke will probably be so much easier that they will get into graduate school more easily than they would have at McGill.
“I can only read and write french as of now.”
You don’t need any French at all to go to McGill. If you learn to speak a little bit (un petit peu) of French this will enhance your experience living in Montreal.

To some extent yes. The last time that I looked (several years ago) McGill didn’t even publish the GPAs of students that they accepted into medical school. I suspected (but never found any real information) that this was because they understood how hard they themselves grade in premed, and adjust for it.

"Most LACs will treat you as an adult (just as much as universities do). Nobody comes around in the morning to ask if you remembered your vitamins or to take your dirty clothes to the laundry. The big difference is that classes at a LAC are consistently small (usually &lt; 20 students, seldom 50 or more); there are no (or few) pre-professional majors (architecture, business, engineering, etc.); total focus is on undergrads; there are fewer majors and course offerings.
In some respects, LACs may be more challenging for undergrads than research universities, although I’m generalizing here (not directly comparing McG & MoHo). At a LAC, you generally can’t sleep your way through a lecture class without the professor noticing. You can expect more class discussion. You’ll probably have more faculty-graded writing assignments, more essay (or short answer) questions on exams, and fewer easily-graded multiple choice (or true/false) tests. You’ll be expected not only to keep up with the reading for class, but also to think about and discuss it, starting in year one. If you cut classes, your absence is more likely to be noticed soon. Grading standards could be tougher or easier (it depends on the school).
Montreal should have a strong edge in internship opportunities over South Hadley and Amherst (although I’m not familiar with how jobs/internships work for internationals in Canada.)

I wasn’t doubting this. I don’t know OP at all. I was just asking OP to decide for himself whether or not he feels that he wants the challenge. To some extent every student has to decide this for himself or herself.
“McGill will have some very bright people and very challenging classes. It also will (at least early on) have gigantic lectures”
During a tour I sat in the largest lecture hall at McGill. I did not count the seats, but as far as I could tell it is the same size as the largest lecture hall at MIT, the room where I studied freshman physics. (Okay, I checked, the largest lecture hall at McGill seats 600, the largest at MIT seats 566).

He plans to study Physics (and go on to grad school). The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations. My impression is that Carleton’s Physics program is stronger than Amherst’s.
[/quote]

Carleton is commonly regarded as one of the more STEM-oriented LACs, while Amherst is sometimes regarded as less STEM-focused.
You can determine the percentage of STEM majors at a LAC by adding up the relevant numbers (for computer science, engineering if offered, biology, math, and physical sciences) in Section J of the Common Data Set. For these two schools, I get:
Carleton: 40.2 % STEM, 12.1 % physical sciences specifically
Amherst: 26.6 % STEM, 5.1 % physical sciences specifically
So there does appear to be more interest in STEM, and in physical sciences particularly, at Carleton. There is some suspicion that “open curriculum” schools (such as Amherst) attract a disproportionate number of science/math-phobes (because they can avoid taking any classes in these fields). In recent years, there has some concern about the aging of the Amherst science facilities, but a brand new science center is under construction, and is scheduled to open in Fall 2018.
I’m sure you can get a great undergraduate physics education at Amherst. However, it wouldn’t surprise me if there are more physics faculty and a broader variety of physics courses at Carleton. You could review the college catalogs to see. Note, however, that Amherst students also have access to the 5-College Consortium, which could increase the range of physics course options, most likely at UMass.

"Congrats!   Carleton is a great school.  No bad choices here.  Amherst is collaborative, not competitive.  It has a lot of athletes, but it also has a lot of artsy types.   The study abroad program is excellent and easily available to all students, including those on financial aid.
Carleton is strong in physics, but Amherst is strong in physics as well (and so is Williams).   All three are among the top dozen colleges in the country in the percentage of their graduates who go on to get PhDs in physics (Pomona is not).
Amherst is the most ethnically diverse top tier LAC, with 47 percent of the student body being persons of color.  It also is the most economically diverse LAC (along with Vassar).  A full quarter of the Amherst class is on Pell Grants, which means lower income students on full rides.  Carleton has about half that.  Not sure how much those things matter to you.
In addition, be aware that Amherst is building a spectacular new science center which will open at the end of your son’s freshman year.

Purely on reputation, I’d give Amherst a small but not insignificant edge. Also, keep in mind the Five College Consortium and those additional resources at hand with Amherst.
But if Carleton is stronger in physics, then that’s certainly reason enough to go there instead. Again, no wrong choices here.

"@csdad2 - Congratulations to your son! My D has decided to go to Carleton (from warm California). She is also interested in STEM and we found Carleton to have one of the strongest programs, among other things. If your son’s goal is to get out of the Midwest, I think discussing your topics is a moot point. Both schools offer equally strong liberals arts education, but they are different in vibe.
Another question to ask him though: does he want to live and work on the East Coast right after graduation? If so, Amherst will have more name recognition there than Carleton for recruiting by employers who are clueless about SLACs. On the other hand, Carleton is better known in the Midwest and among friends in our community, here in California (which is the second biggest supplier of Carls after Minnesota). But in the end, both schools have strong reputations and alumni networks, and both are highly regarded by grad schools, if that is your son’s goal. And among employers who know SLACs, both will have equal standing.

My friends who are physics faculty at top universities (including a college roommate who is a physics professor at Stanford) seem to think Carleton has one of the strongest programs while Amherst is known more for its strength in the humanities & social sciences. This is reflected in the breakdown of students by major too. However, Amherst is an amazing school and I’m sure your son will get a great science education in either school. Incidentally, physics is one of my D’s interests. BTW, did your son get a nice letter from the Carleton physics department chair, Prof. Pattanayak? If he listed Physics as an interest on Common App, he should have.

[quote]
The general campus atmosphere: My son prefers an open, collaborative, diverse, somewhat laid-back environment.
[/quote]

Amherst is more diverse ethnically. They have recently made a push to recruit URMs, and the very fact that the college president’s quote on diversity was a topic for the Common App writing supplement speaks volumes about their priorities.
Carleton is 60% White. However, Carleton tries hard to make their student body as diverse as possible, given that Minnesota doesn’t attract as many minority students, and they love international students. Moreover, our impression is that the students are very respectful of other cultures, open-minded about diverse ideas and customs, and welcoming of diverse students. (We are Asian American.) Diversity can also refer to interests and personalities, and Carleton is definitely diverse in that sense. My wife and daughter attended the International Festival last Saturday while visiting Carleton and saw evidence of this. Plus, they explicitly asked minority students whether they felt uncomfortable there. Except for one African American male, most said that they never felt excluded or uncomfortable. One African American male from L.A. went so far as to say that he has never worried about being profiled or harassed by cops in the Twin Cities or Northfield, which is a far cry from his lifelong experience in diverse Southern California. (St. Olaf, however, is a different story. Read the news to learn what’s happening there. But right-minded students are standing up against hate and protesting against the administration, which has apparently done nothing to combat the racist acts.)
Our takeaway from visits and conversations was that Carleton is one of the friendliest, most supportive, and most collaborative colleges out there. And while the academics are intense, they are pretty laid back, or at least they don’t overtly give off a competitive vibe. Amherst seemed more “classic New England competitive” to us, and students didn’t appear as happy on the surface, but I don’t want to generalize based on our experience at one point in time. You’ll find all kinds of students at both schools, and I’m sure your son will find a core group of friends who will make his college years a positive experience. Faculty at both schools are great.

[quote]
The kind of students who go there: To give an idea, one thing he really liked about Carleton, in a survey asking students what word they’d use to describe students there, “quirky” was the top choice (at another school, it was “hipster”, which he didn’t care for).
[/quote]

PSA: Some past and present Carls are requesting that people get over the “quirky” label.  However, it is true that students at Carleton come from colorful backgrounds, which makes life more interesting. I can tell you that we found the students (and other college community members) to be the friendliest and most down-to-earth of the 30+ colleges we visited. EVERYONE would stop and talk at length about everything we wanted to know, and if they were rushing to class, they would offer to drag my daughter along with them to class, introduce her to professors, and treat her to coffee and lunch afterwards. How cool is that? This is precisely why she fell in love with that place.
Our tour guide at Amherst was friendly, but aren’t all of them expected to be? The average student we intercepted to chat seemed to be in a hurry to get away, no matter the time of day. Not a reason to judge an entire school, but we couldn’t help coming away with certain perceptions of the campus culture.

We often hear about the prominence of athletics at schools like Amherst (and Williams). Just how much is this the case there, and how would it affect someone not active in athletics? (My son played soccer in high school, also some ultimate and tennis, but he is not at a level to play on a college team.)
[/quote]

I don’t think this will be a big deal at either school. At most schools, even SLACs, athletes (and the men/women attracted to them) often form cliques. It goes hand in hand with team bonding. However, it usually doesn’t affect other students, unless they are dying to be part of who they perceive to be the “in” crowd and get rejected. And we’re not talking about giant powerhouses of NCAA Division I here.

The study abroad program
[/quote]

We like Carleton’s specific options, but both schools will offer excellent opportunities. One difference worth noting: the Carleton trimester-based academic calendar enables a student with demanding academic requirements (for a double major, for example) to go abroad for the six-week winter break (Thanksgiving to New Year’s) or for a 10-week trimester. In the latter case, the student can still take classes in Northfield for the other two trimesters, if desired. (Or you can go abroad for half a year to a year.)

We’re in Illinois, and one of my son’s preferences is to get out of the midwest. (I’m from the east coast originally, and still have family there.)

There you go. Amherst wins, if this is important to your son. For us, it was the opposite. My daughter will be experiencing something very different by going to the Midwest, which is one reason she turned down all of her California choices. I agree with your son that it is important to explore something different.

[quote]
Amherst’s endowment is quite a bit larger – does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools?
[/quote]

Not that I noticed, but there may some advantages. Amherst has a slightly better student:faculty ratio. My impression is that Amherst provides slightly better financial aid, but each person’s experience may be different. On the other hand, Amherst has a higher sticker price, and Carleton spends more on R&D (can’t find my source, but I saw the figures somewhere). So who knows?

[quote]
Financial aid: Amherst’s aid is “no loan”. Does that mean we can’t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to? And if we can, would it be on top of the grant they’ve already given us, or would it displace some of it? (Their website seems to suggest the former; I plan to speak with their FA office tomorrow.) With the loan, the FA packages are very similar.
[/quote]

You can always borrow a Parent Plus loan up to the expected family contribution. It will not replace any grants or scholarships. Eligibility for Federal Stafford loans, subsidized or unsubsidized, should be stated on the financial aid offer.
Good luck! As others will tell you, your son can’t go wrong with either choice. Great schools.

"^I would not use the raw numbers, or even proportions, of science majors at a school to evaluate the quality of that college’s programs in science. Quality is far more reliant on the professors and the resources offered at the college. One could also argue that open-curriculum schools attract a lot of STEM students who want to avoid taking humanities classes, and indeed, I have heard many STEM students make that claim. So I’d avoid stereotyping and go straight for the facts.
Let’s also remember that undergraduate students go to get a well-rounded undergraduate education, not specifically to study one thing like a graduate program. It’s important to go to a college with a solid department in the area of interest (particularly if there is interest in doing research), but either Carleton or Amherst will offer that. You could literally flip a coin and be fine. You don’t have to go to the best tippy-top school in a specific discipline to get into a PhD program in that area. What you need is a good solid department and at least one professor who is willing to mentor and shepherd you through for research and grad school. I’m confident you could get that at either college.
A quick look at the departmental websites show that their physics faculty is about the same size - if I counted correctly, excluding visiting and emeriti professors there are 9 full-time, tenure or tenure-track faculty at Carleton and 8 at Amherst. Amherst’s are, on average, more established in their careers (they are more heavily populated with full professors, who have typically been teaching 12-15+ years), but not by a whole lot - Carleton has one or two more assistant professors, it seems. The faculty at both Amherst and Carleton got their PhDs from physics departments of roughly equivalent quality, on average. A few more of Carleton’s faculty went to higher-ranked programs. Both have solid representation in astronomy and astrophysics, from browsing the catalogs. Amherst may benefit from a close connection with UMass, which has a mid-ranked physics doctoral program.
I don’t know anything about physical facilities but those can offer a clue to the level of investment (and anticipated enrollments) a college has in particular subject areas.
I will say, though, that Carleton is a top 10 producer of PhDs more generally and a top 5 producer of PhDs in the physical sciences. Amherst is in the top 30 for science and engineering PhDs overall. That could be due to a lot of different factors, but interest and investment in the sciences might be contributing factors there too. (Pomona is in the top 15 and Williams is in the top 20. This data is from the Survey of Earned Doctorates conducted by the National Science Foundation.)

"@juillet and @bucketDad make a good point: you go to a liberal arts school for a well-rounded education, so simply comparing physics departments is selling yourself short. Besides, who knows what your son will become interested in once he starts college? In this comparison, I think the academics are generally comparable. However, your son may prefer the open curriculum of Amherst to the breadth requirements of Carleton (or vice versa). I would caution you on comparing specific professors. You’ll find great professors at both schools.
Then there is the question of three classes per trimester (Carleton) vs. four classes per semester (Amherst). This can make a huge difference, depending on your son’s learning style. As an example, since my firstborn is a champion of procrastination and last-minute cramming, like her father, the trimester system is excellent. She is used to the fast pace given her background in taking classes at the community college (quarter system), and the ten-week schedule will give her no time to slack off. On the other hand, a friend of ours with a chemistry degree from Berkeley looked at the syllabus of the intro chemistry class and said, “Whoa. That’s a lot to absorb in such a short period of time.” The semester system gives you more time to let concepts sink in. What does your son prefer? Is he disciplined about staying on top of his work and pacing himself?
Regarding @juillet 's point about facilities, I can tell you firsthand that Carleton’s science facilities are better than Amherst’s, and further improvements are in the works. Then again, someone mentioned that Amherst also has improvement projects planned, so during your son’s time in college, this may become a wash.

I would not use the raw numbers, or even proportions, of science majors at a school to evaluate the quality of that college’s programs in science.

The community of fellow physics students (and of STEM students generally) is going to be significantly larger at Carleton than at Amherst. In the Class of 2016, for example, a Carleton physics major had 25 other physics students in his or her class, while an Amherst physics major had 6. This seems like it would be a noticeable difference.
A larger physics community doesn’t automatically make Carleton a better choice – the whole point of LACs, after all, is that smaller can be better. However, it is a difference that will affect the undergraduate experience of a physics major, and which is therefore worthy of consideration.

That would be my kid who stated exactly that reason for preferring an open curriculum.  But lo and behold, she’s taken a writing class and a couple of humanities courses and in one case encountered a favorite professor. She is a STEM major in a small department and so far that means she gets a lot of attention from the dept chair and her professors, help with planning summer research, study abroad plus research connections, and rec letters.

The science center is under construction and is supposed to open fall '18. There are details here: https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/future/greenway-campus/science-center
Amherst hosts a SURF program in the following areas (currently, they change year to year): https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/support/funding/students/amherst-student-research-funding-opportunities/summer-research-opportunities-at-amherst/2017-surf-research-areas - it’s paid and comes with housing. They will also provide funding for unpaid internships and research elsewhere.

"S1, a HS junior, has interest in both those schools if he decides to go the LAC route. Completely different reasons than the OP’s. Aunt, Uncles and cousins live in Amherst, and he has interest in working near  the economic centers of Boston, Washington, NYC, Philly, etc. when he graduates. Seems Amherst would be better for that.
He had moderate interest in Carleton till he visited. He was kind of knocked out by most of it. Hey, I wanted to go there! I think it’s setting in rural MN is kind of a blessing. If it was in a more populated/warmer region I believe it would be overrun with applicants. Course, then the tenor of the school would probably change, and students and staff would start strutting around with their noses in the air.
I don’t think either school is a sports powerhouse, but would guess that Amherst is more accomplished in that area.
Excuse the random musings.
Carleton was actually the more expensive of the two when I ran the NPC's for our middle class income bracket, but it wasn't a large difference.

You’re giving the open curriculum too much credit here.
Don’t get me wrong – it’s great that a STEM major takes lots of cool non-STEM classes. This is, in fact, the LAC ideal. But the exact same thing would have been possible at a LAC with distribution requirements, e.g. Carleton or Williams or Swarthmore. The point of distribution requirements is simply to guarantee that a STEM major takes non-STEM classes.
So you could have been a STEM major and taken lots of cool non-STEM courses at any of these schools. The only difference is that Amherst allowed you to take cool non-STEM courses on a voluntary basis, while at the other schools, taking cool non-STEM courses would have been required. But the net result (for you) would have been exactly the same.
If you plan to explore a wide variety of disciplines during your LAC career, then it makes no difference whether you pick a school with an open curriculum or one with distribution requirements. If there are distribution requirements, you will fulfill them without even trying.
The open curriculum matters for people who want to limit their explorations. For example, if you were a STEM major and you wanted to avoid taking non-STEM courses, then it would make a big difference if you enrolled at Amherst vs. the other schools.

I’m sure that this is true. However, I also think that there are significantly more “science-phobes” and “math-phobes” out there than “social science-phobes” or “humanities-phobes”.
Amherst’s own data bear this out. The following numbers are from the Amherst Class of 2011, and were compiled for a 2013 accreditation review. For comparison, let’s use “3+ classes per academic division” as a benchmark, because it is a common LAC distribution requirement (as at, for example, Williams):
Humanities Division: 8% did not meet the benchmark (i.e. took fewer than 3 classes in this division). 1% took zero classes.
Social & Behavioral Sciences Division: 10% did not meet the benchmark. 2% took zero classes.
Science & Math: 43% did not meet the benchmark. 14% took zero classes.
It’s hard to escape the conclusion that many Amherst students use the open curriculum as a way to avoid science and math. Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many.
Another way to look at it: 92% of the Amherst Class of 2011 would have satisfied commonly used distribution requirements for humanities, and 91% would have done so in social sciences. But only 57% would have done so in science and math.

That may be true.  It doesn’t change the fact that the students at Amherst who DO choose to do science and math fare very well and have excellent opportunities and college support for further academic study like PhDs, for medical school and other professional schools, and for recruiting to businesses.

This is not, by the way, an argument for dropping the open curriculum at Amherst (or any other school). On the contrary, it’s great that there are a variety of different LACs with different curricular options.
I do think, though, that the open curriculum has certain consequences that are not widely appreciated. Ironically, it may lead to a curriculum that is actually narrow and “closed” by traditional LAC standards. So while I am not arguing for change to the open curriculum, I am arguing for greater “openness” about it.

Check out:
www.thecollegesolution.com/the-colleges-where-phds-get-their-start/
According to those lists, Carleton is #7 for sending students on to PhD programs in Physics.  Amherst appears on other lists, but not the physics list.  That’s one data point, if you are looking at numeric data, but you also got a great anecdote from a poster here who majored in physics at Amherst, so individual experiences may vary.
As long as both physics programs look like they can match his needs and interests, he might weigh environmental factors of the school more heavily.
Carleton has St. Olaf nearby, but Amherst shares a consortium with Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Hampshire, and U Mass Amherst. That increases the breadth of courses available to you. And that also means there are a lot of women around!
The open curriculum does not mean just that you can avoid subjects. It means that everyone in every class is there because they are truly interested in the subject. That has to influence class discussions.
Amherst has seemingly limitless resources. Our tour guide said he was blown away by how much they can do for their students. He told us about how you can borrow a car and go to Boston or the White Mountains in NH or something, and Amherst even will reimburse the students for the gas.
As far as the athletic thing goes: as you pointed out, people say that about Williams too. I never played a sport at Williams. I never even went to a game a game at Williams. I am the least athletic person ever. And I was very happy socially and never felt excluded from anything in any way. You find like-minded friends wherever you go, I think. And Williams at least had a very friendly culture where people interacted across groups, maybe because of the freshman entry system mixing up everyone from the start. Our tour guide at Amherst this year wasn’t an athlete, either, and he was African American, and a math/philosophy double major, and he was very happy at Amherst.
I know Amherst better than Carleton, as someone who visited Amherst three times before picking Williams, my husband applied there too, and we have visited it recently with my son. None of us had any interest in leaving the northeast, so we did not visit Carleton, but it does sound awesome in college guides and on this site.

Seriously, there are 24 Carl’s in Rome with two History professors right now, taking their full load  of 3 classes: 1 on ancient Rome, can’t remember the second - maybe Renaissance time period?, and 3 was some sort of writing focus).

For example, when I read the comments from current or incoming Carleton parents, I am detecting certain themes that resonate with me. It’s no coincidence that I too am an incoming Carleton parent.

"Hey, OP. Former Carl parent here. A few thoughts …
Work study … You indicated that they find jobs for the kids. I don’t remember that being the case for ds, especially after his first year. As a freshman, he worked in the dining hall, but I think that’s because he wasn’t aggressive in finding his own gig. Subsequent years, he found jobs that were more suited to his interests, though I will say that he loved even working in the dining hall. lol One thing I loved is how kids get paid. They can either take all the money, have their whole check credited to their student account or split it 50-50. I assumed every school did this, but that wasn’t the case at ds2’s university; as a result, I think the cash got squandered. Not so for ds1 – he had all his check rolled over into his account and was such a diligent worker that he got a fat refund when he graduated!
He did study abroad junior year in a non-Carleton program. In addition to the Carleton-led options, there are scores of other options thanks to the consortiums to which Carleton belongs. Every year, there’s a big study-abroad fair where kids can check out their choices, and that’s how ds found his program –  a semester in New Zealand. He absolutely loved it, including meeting kids from other colleges. Every year on his birthday, the first person on FB to post a msg is his host mom from Auckland. It’s so fun to get that yearly reminder of his wonderful time there. The FA office was wonderful. Everything went really smoothly. He handled the whole thing, and it just couldn’t have gone better.
About ultimate … well, it’s a thing at Carleton. If he doesn’t want to play super-competitively, there’s the Hot Karls, the developmental team. And, of course, the DIII team and the DI team. Just knowing that he played ultimate in HS makes me think that he belongs at Carleton!  Yes, Amherst has a team, too. But I’m unabashedly biased.

Their epiphany was based more than anything on the other kids that were there, i.e., that they felt that they’d find “their people” at the school.
I’m in the camp that your son can’t/shouldn’t try to differentiate the schools based on academics, in that there’s no way that he’d exhaust the academic resources at either of these fine schools.  And either school will serve him well as a launchpad to whatever comes next.  I think he’s best served by looking at the gestalt of each school, and deciding where he thinks he’d more easily fit.

I remember when ds1 was looking at Carleton that there seemed to be a feeling that trimesters were bad. It wasn’t enough to dissuade him, but I remember talking about it. For me, it ended up being fantastic in ways I wouldn’t have imagined.
When the kids come home early Thanksgiving week, they are home until January. This meant a couple of things …
One, there was no expensive, extra trip home two holidays in a row. You never know what the weather will be like in MN in November. We never had to worry whether those pricey tickets we bought were going to get eaten because he couldn’t get out or back due to weather or that the trip was severely shortened because of delays and such. When he got home for turkey, he was home past New Year’s. Ds2, who is at a faraway school on the semester system, has never come for Thanksgiving.
Two, that long break was so welcome. His first two years, he worked for his summer employer. They were thrilled to have him filling 25 hours/week during the busy holiday season. And he loved the extra money.  The third year he got home the week before Christmas because he was abroad. The fourth year he used that extra time to study for the GRE and took it the week before he flew back.
Three, people seemed to think that doing study abroad would be difficult because of the trimesters. Well, if you are doing a Carleton program that’s obviously not an issue. And kids, such as my ds, who do a non-Carleton program, just did it in the fall, when it’s an even trade (one trimester/one semester). And, they miss some of that cold weather by not going to campus until spring. Well, “spring.”

Also it is strong across the board so I don’t think you would be getting a more well-rounded education at Yale. That said the academic focus at Yale is different.  More theoretical. In terms of grade inflation, Yale a more grade-inflated.

"@sheilsarda Personally i feel undergrad focus is a rather vague term. Penn engineering has about 435 students per class while Yale has 108. Still you will have access to professors, TAs at both. I never felt i didn’t have access to my professors at Penn and all classes are taught by professors who also hold regular office hours. The fact that there are more students interested in STEM meant more STEM- oriented student organizations and more like-minded people to learn from. Penn engineering is still at a very manageable size (435 per class is not a lot) but also quite diverse because of its size. Also i feel the research opportunities and stem-related extracurricular involvement are more robust and diverse.

"Difference in faculty strengths for CS are negligible: (US News Ranks: #19 vs #20). Biomedical engineering at Yale it is a small program, but builds on its world leading Biology, Medicine and Chemistry departments, which are all top 10-12 in the world, and the research by faculty is cutting edge. (Check out Mark Saltzmann and Andre Levchenko’s research, as well the the Yale West Campus among other things). I presume Biomedical Engineering at Penn isn’t an option for you, but the curriculum requirements are broadly similar anyway.
If you’re interested in entrepreneurship, Wharton definitely has a much larger group of people with like minded interests, but Yale also sees its fair share of startups. The Yale Entrepreneurial Institute gives out tons of money each year and there are lots of companies that start off as collaborations between undergraduates, medical school, law school and business school students.
If you want to be the best engineer, I would suggest Yale even though Penn might have a larger engineering program, because the Jerome Fisher program has a huge number of requirements that are economics/finance based. At Yale you could devote that time to engineering/math/science courses instead if you wish.
The campus culture at both schools is mostly defined by the mix of majors. At Yale more students tend to be involved in the arts and government as well as public service. At Penn, you’ll find more students interested in finance, business, etc. There will be lots of science geeks at both places at well. Lastly, Penn has a much larger number of students (24,000+) vs Yale (12,000), and Yale also has a residential college program, which might mean a smaller, more intimate atmosphere for undergrads.

I do believe the Parchment data, where the split is 58%-42% in favor of Yale (although the split is not statistically significant according to parchment). The difference is driven primarily by liberal arts and pure sciences  admits who  would choose Yale much more, but Yale loses a big chunk of the engineering and business admits to Penn. It is precisely because it has an edge in these preprofessional areas than Penn is able to attract more cross-admits.  By comparison the split between Harvard vs Penn and Stanford vs Penn is 77% vs 23% and 72% vs 28% and is statistically significant. And this is because it cannot attract as many of these admits from Stanford and Harvard.
We are talking about engineering in general, op is not exactly set on bioengineering. but even for bioengineering, while the difference is not huge,  Penn is still  ranked higher and in combination with its stronger medical school and hospital and higher research funding in this field, it can be argued that it has an good edge.

Finally, there’s no major difference on bioengineering or on medical schools, where both Penn and Yale are top-ten. If you’re going to hang everything on rankings, it looks like a lot of Penn and Yale grads didn’t get the memo that they should have gone to Georgia Tech or UCSD for bioengineering.

Most people consider the residential colleges to be one of the strongest points about Yale.  They tend to foster a great sense of community, and make the university more accessible.  Freshmen are generally undeclared, and the majority of them are not physically housed in the residential college itself (depending on the college), so you would almost certainly be with “random roommates we’ll probably not be in my major”.  Many students change prospective majors.  All of that is part of the experience of being at a school with a strong liberal arts focus.
I’m a huge fan of Penn’s dual degree programs, for the right students.  Those students are usually very focused and motivated, and are ready to jump in from day 1.  If you know you want to combine engineering and entrepreneurship, and like the idea of being with a elite cohort of similar students, it’s hard to beat M&T.   The program will certain have extreme rigor and a heavy workload, but I don’t get the sense that most people find the environment toxic.
Both are amazing schools, but very different experiences (especially with M&T factored in).  I would think it depends on whether you want a more focused, intense experience in your subjects of interest with a lot of resources and a program tailored to your interests, or a broader, more liberal arts based experience, where you will have to carve out your own path.

"This seems right to me.

The idea is that living with a variety of people studying various things, in a smaller community (the residential college, which you’re affiliated with whether or not you live in it as a freshman), is part of your education. Penn is a much more pre-professional environment, and that’s what some students undoubtedly prefer and thrive in.

"@Parapraxes
Your post shows just how strong the “HYMPS” designation is.  Further, Admissions Dean Richard Shaw talks about the admissions “systems” at the top 5 being quite similar, so that the overlap is highest here (p. 24 of https://stanford.app.box.com/s/y4abufqg66nte7uax6eq).
What this demonstrates, then, is the extraordinarily small number of cross-admits who get into a top 5, but then choose to go elsewhere.  In the report, Stanford lists its top 12 admissions competitors (with UPenn coming in at #11 - an increase from some years back, so, to @Penn95 - a good sign for Penn!).
The data is sobering, however.  Stanford now takes 42% of cross-admits with Harvard (up from 35% in years past), and takes the big majority from everywhere else.  Dean Shaw even says that, outside of HYMP, no school takes more than “single digit percentages” from Stanford.  With Penn at #11 in Stanford’s top competitor pool, and not taking more than 9.9% of cross-admits (in past years, Shaw actually posted the data - and Penn took 2%, but recently he’s stopped even bothering posting data from non-HYMP schools), it means maybe only 5-15 students at Penn turn down Stanford a year.
BRINGING THIS BACK around to the discussion about Yale - it’s important to remember the numbers here.  As Yale has about a 70% yield rate, and its admissions system resembles Stanford, it stands to reason that it loses the biggest chunk (60-70%) of its cross-admit pool to HMPS.  So, for the 600 students who don’t choose Yale, HMPS probably gets about 400 of them.  There are then only 200 Yale admits who choose to go elsewhere.
Of that 200, if Penn does phenomenally well, it brings in what, 20 students?  (That would be an extraordinary haul, btw, because it means of the 300+ colleges in america that could be competing for the 200 yale cross-admits not choosing HMPS, Penn would get 10% of them.)  So, all should keep in mind that the universe we’re talking about here is super small.
In choosing for fit (which is the key when choosing between somewhat like institutions): Yale has released the survey results from their mental health survey, and the data can be found here: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/586d882946c3c40a1c57b1ee/t/5875baf06a49630b1d28f122/1484110581172/YCC-Mental-Health-Report-1ms1ra1.pdf
Penn, unfortunately, has not released its own survey results, just its recommendations for an overhaul, as seen here: https://billypenn.com/2015/02/23/experts-students-mystified-by-penn-suicide-task-forces-change-the-culture-mandate-how-exactly-do-you-do-that/
There are overlaps between Yale’s extensive report and Penn’s (incomplete) reporting - both schools stress excellence across many sectors, although social endeavors receive more attention in the Penn report.  Further, at Penn, the importance of seeming “perfect” seems more pronounced, whereas at Yale, there seems to be more pressure to appear “happy.”
You can also sift through school cultural/inclusion climate reports.  You can find Yale’s here: http://provost.yale.edu/title-ix/yale-report-aau-campus-climate-survey and UPenn’s here: http://www.upenn.edu/ir/surveys/AAU/Report%20and%20Tables%20on%20AAU%20Campus%20Climate%20Survey.pdf

"@Parapraxes @Cue7 - there’s a related debate on a different thread, so I’m going to cross-post something here:

[quote]
I continue to wonder where Stanford gets the above information (I don’t know what the abbreviations for the sources at the bottom of the slide mean). I’m not an expert, but it seems to me it might not be legal for universities to share with each other who got in and went where. If they can’t do that, the data must be self-reported by the students, in which case how can it be reliable or complete?
Also, I wonder how Stanford characterizes a student who gets into, say, Harvard, Yale and Stanford, and enrolls at Harvard. It’s a win for Harvard in cross-admits with Stanford, but how does Stanford reflect that the student was a Yale-Stanford cross-admit and chose to attend neither school? Also, is there double-counting in the total numbers of cross-admits (i.e., does that kid show up as a Stanford cross-admit with both Harvard and Yale)?
In this regard, the Today Show reported this morning that the set of quadruplets who all were admitted to Harvard and Yale (and at least one of which was also admitted to Stanford) have all chosen Yale (see the thread on this subject, also here: http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/ohio-quadruplets-accepted-ivies-will-attend-yale-together-n753146) - so I guess there’s a real-life illustration of the problem in accounting for cross-admits to multiple places.
Finally, as I’ve said elsewhere, assuming the numbers on the Stanford slide are correct, a 10% swing in any direction with any school looks like a big shift but represents 21 or fewer people. Given that HYPS all have 70-80% yields, the overlap in the admitted students must be small. Also, I would guess, many students give a lot of weight to geography in making their decision. I would be very interested to know the choices of Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and West Coast students cross-admitted with Stanford and any of HYP.
[/quote]

Note that those quadruplets all by themselves probably represent a ~2% shift to Yale in its cross-admit match-up with Harvard, which illustrates how small the actual cross-admit numbers are and how little one can read into cross-admit trends.

"@DeepBlue86 - yes, I think it’s key to see just how SMALL the universe of cross-admits is.  Even amongst the top 5 schools, the actual numbers are pretty tiny (say 50-100 students actively deciding between a couple top 5s).
Below the top 5 schools, then, the number of cross-admits going to any other school is really small - like in the single and low double digits.
It is amazing - as HYMPS have similar admissions “systems,” out of, say, the 1-2 million people applying to US colleges in any given year, only about 8,000-9,000 are truly in the running at the top 5.  That’s maybe only an eighth of a percent of the applicant pool!  This speaks to:
1.) the selectivity at the tippy top AND
2.) a narrow-mindedness in what the top schools seek.  Dean Shaw, in the Stanford Report, noted that he needs to come up with reasons why a student is accepted at Stanford and not Harvard, and faculty question him on it.  I’m not sure it’s a good thing that all top schools now define “excellence” in the same narrow way.

The population that applies to HYPSM each year consists of, I’m going to guess, something around 125,000 unique applicants, competing for something over 9,000 total offers of admission, with total freshman enrollment at the five schools of something over 7,000 (i.e., there are about 2,000 cross-admits across the five schools).  I’ll guess that half of the applicants are unqualified and are denied on first reading.  Then let’s say that across the five schools 850 of the slots go to recruited athletes and a similar number go to legacies.  I’ll assume that one in five of these gets one cross-admit to another school in the group (bearing in mind that although the athletes are talented, they’re mostly recruited early and often don’t apply to more than one of HYPMS, and although the legacies may be high-quality, the hook only works in one place).  I’ll assume 2,400 other HYPSM legacies are denied at their legacy school as well as all the other four.  So now we’re at 58,400 remaining applicants for 7,960 remaining offers.
Bear with me at this point - I’m going to allude to race, but I believe my points are noncontroversial, and I apologize if I inadvertently offend anyone.  I’m not aiming to provoke a discussion about race in college admissions, or to opine about what colleges should be doing in this area, so I hope no one will go there.
I estimate there are about 1,200 URM matriculants among HYPSM in each year.  The population of URMs that test in the top 1% of their racial group is, I estimate, a few thousand.  I believe a large number of these academically elite URMs who apply to any of HYPSM will get an offer, and that they are very likely to be cross-admitted.  Let’s say 600 of the academically tippy-top URMs apply to at least one of HYPSM and get 1.5 offers each on average.  The remainder of the admitted URMs overlap with other groups described herein.  This takes us to something like 57,800 remaining applicants for 7,060 remaining offers.
Now to the ORMs.  Of the ~125,000 unique applicants to HYPSM, I’m going to assume that 21,500 are either Asian-American or international (principally Asian), since that number is roughly equivalent to the top 10% of Asian-American high school seniors (somewhat less than that number will apply, and I’m assuming it gets made up by internationals).  Let’s say roughly 1,500 will ultimately matriculate across HYPSM, and that they’ll get 1.25 HYPSM offers each on average (i.e., one in four gets two offers, the rest get one).  The other 19,000 are denied.  That brings us down to 37,300 applicants for 5,185 remaining offers.
Let’s say each school has 50 (for a total of 250) miscellaneous other “institutional priorities” on average (development case, celebrity or celebrity offspring, from the 50th state, faculty brat, child of a foreign government official, very strong in some sport that doesn’t get a recruit spot, contrabassoon virtuoso, Broadway performer, published author or other unique talent, etc.) and they get 1.5 offers each on average - now we’re at 37,050 applicants for 4,810 remaining offers.
Assume 300 unquestionable geniuses, who get 2 HYPSM offers each on average - we’re now down to 36,750 applicants for 4,210 remaining offers.
I’m going to guess most of the desired number of first-gens at each school has been reached via overlap with the athletes, URMs and other institutional priorities groups, but let’s assume another 500 across the five schools are admitted (e.g., through QuestBridge) and get 1.2 admits each on average.  Now we’re at 36,250 applicants for 3,610 remaining offers
At this point, we get to everyone else and individual results become much less predictable - did the rest of your package, i.e., your essays, recommendations, etc., speak to the adcoms in the right way?  Did you convince them that you and the school are a perfect match?  Some of the best unhooked or weaker-hooked kids may have lightning strike in more than one place, because they have an unusual story.  I think 2,600 students or so divide those 3,610 remaining offers; the other 33,650 are denied.
So, let’s check the math:  125,000 applicants, less 62,500 denied for being unqualified, less 2,400 denied legacies, less 19,000 denied ORMs/internationals, less 33,650 others denied equals 7,450 HYPSM matriculants - pretty close to the aggregate number of 7,217 posited by @spayurpets in last year’s compilation of admissions data.
The numbers also add up to 2,060 cross-admits among the HYPSM schools.  Since there are 10 possible two-school cross-admit pairs, this means that there are just over 200 cross-admitted students on average for each two-school pair, which seems in line with the Stanford faculty senate numbers. Bear in mind that each school hands out about 2,000 admits, so the cross-admit percentage is roughly 10% with any other school.
Yes, I know this is a gross oversimplification and people will have differing opinions as to the size and composition of the groups, but I don’t think it’s a million miles from the truth.  One can see how these schools could have processes that are more similar than different, but that the aggregate number of cross-admits could still be pretty small.  This is, in my opinion, because large percentages of cross-admits tend to be found in groups that have small numbers (e.g., elite URMs, institutional priorities and unquestionable geniuses, all of whom are rare and highly-prized), while for the larger groups (e.g., ORMs/internationals and the unhooked), chances are that different (albeit possibly overlapping) subsets will be admitted at each of HYPSM because the large numbers make individual admits less predictable.

"As a follow-up, I should have clarified two things.
First, it should be clear that I worked backwards from known numbers of matriculated students (e.g., athletes, legacies, Asians) to figure out how HYPSM ended up with those numbers. What I’m not saying is that these schools decide, for example, how many Asians they want, make a list of Asian applicants and then pick out names until they get to the quota. Admissions is holistic, and candidates may check multiple boxes (this, for example, is why I believe academically elite URMs, or highly-qualified development-level legacies face significantly better odds than applicants with a single hook). I think there may be some tweaking of the final list of admits before release to keep numbers “balanced”, but I think it starts by picking kids that are holistically, and collectively, the best mix for the school’s needs.
Second, and related to the above, I’m conscious that I haven’t allowed for admits who fit in multiple categories. It would have been too complicated and speculative to try to adjust for that. I don’t want to give the impression, though, that I don’t believe anyone in my “unquestionable genius” category is URM or ORM, for example (I’m sure plenty are), or that all international admits are either Asian or institutional priorities. The groups are presented without overlap to keep things simple.

"Good posts @DeepBlue86, note that Fareed Zarkaria (Time, CNN) did argue there was a de facto Asian quota, maybe not a number but a percentage (like more or less the ivies and Stanford will cap Asians at 20% or so).  He argued it was similar to the one Jewish applicants faced when the ivies didn’t want to admit them but they had the best academic credentials. But I agree that colleges should be able to choose their class as they see fit.
BTW, how do you define a genius, I thought I knew one, lol, but he got waitlisted at Stanford.

"Personally, I think there is a de facto Asian quota, but I also believe there is a de facto legacy quota and various other de facto quotas, because the number of seats is finite and the universities want to ensure that all the constituencies I listed are well-represented - so some get squeezed.

"@deepblue86 “I also believe there is a de facto legacy quota”
It seems to me that the benefit of legacy continues to decline every year. Legacy percents are generally declining and at some schools legacy admits have higher stats than the rest of the student body. That suggests to me that the bump for legacy is not very large.

",0,University of Pennsylvania,Yale University,2,201-1909416-jerome-fisher-penn-vs-yale-engineering,57
"I think the increased recruitment of first-gens has been paralleled by a decrease in legacy enrollment. There are only so many slots, and legacies generally need to be brilliant or connected nowadays. As I’ve said elsewhere, it’s in the interest of the universities for the alumni to think the preference is big enough to be meaningful, and for everyone else to think it’s so small as to be irrelevant. As a result, between two-thirds and 80% of legacies (who are generally more qualified than the average applicant) are denied, which still translates to significantly better odds than non-legacy applicants face. That’s a topic for other threads, though.

"First, congratulations!
We live in the Boston area and have searched for engineering schools with our 2 oldest children.  They both started their search investigating broad areas of concentration (biomedical and robotics engineering).  Their engineering parents held back our opinions but steered both to the conclusion that they needed to choose a traditional engineering discipline (mechanical, chemical, civil, electrical) and choosing an industry should be saved for a concentration or master’s/PHD program.  Four years of depth; not just breath.   That process worked well; one chose Chemical and Biomolecular and the second Mechanical.
We all learned that both children needed to be in an environment that feeds their interests.  In the case of the ChemE, a campus with a medical school researching in partnership with the ChemE department and a strong Biomedical program.  In the case of the ME, an incredible robotics department, a robust ECE department (there are not may of these and GT is on top), flexibility to add not just CS but EE coursework to an ME curriculum, creating a concentration in systems.  For your interests, GT has it all with many research facilities.  My husband has been hiring for 20+ years.  His managers interview MIT, WPI, Cornell,GT students; it’s really about the candidate not the particular school.  Our freshman is returning to New England to work in Pharma this summer.  Landing internships from afar can easily happen if you get research experience in college and actively pursue summer opportunities.
Olin will be diverse but likely in the eclectic way that MA suburban charter high schools attract a type of student.  If that is not your type of happy home for 4 years, take the leap to Atlanta.  I understand the anxiety especially since most MA students do not leave New England because there are so many private schools.  The distance may be greater, but Atlanta, Baltimore & Philly have easier access to home than a drive to Ithica or Rochester in the middle of the winter.

"Those two schools are so different, to compare and contrast should be easy. Our child also had the choice of GT and Olin (among others) and the decision didn’t take very long. The feeling was that Olin beats GT (from our student’s perspective) in research opportunities, culture, and lifestyle. The last two are really subjective, but it is worth mentioning that Olin has a very cooperative atmosphere. From all reports I have seen, GT is more of a competitive (if not quite cut throat) scene. There are no frats at Olin – and it would be difficult to imagine any greek organization ever happening there (not just because of their size, also because of their culture). On the other hand, Geek organizations thrive. There are no varsity sports at Olin. While both schools have traditions, at Olin they are still making traditions (“you get to be a giant instead of standing on the shoulders of giants”). As far as research opportunities, Olin is undergraduate-only, First Year students are routinely involved in research. I’m sure GT undergraduates get research opportunities, but it is undoubtedly much more difficult to find the opportunities.

They put a big emphasis on an well rounded, integrated process including entrepreneurship and liberal arts. It is definitely a love it or hate it environment.

"Companies come to Olin to hire because their students have already demonstrated the ability to start and complete a project to the end in their four years.  They have demonstrated their ability to work in teams, and to have actual project management experience from day one.  How many ‘traditional’ engineering school students can say they have overseen multiple product development projects by the time they graduate?  This is what companies want.  I dare say the lack of theoretical base has not hurt them one bit as they have done ‘real world’ engineering work for four years.  This is why companies like Microsoft and Google have been snapping up Olin graduates.

"@helpless2017 If your goal is to publish research, then GT is your school, not Olin.  Olin students have research internships, often with faculty members.  But I don’t think their work will result in their names on the research publication.  Olin’s emphasis is on practical hands on engineering and problem solving, not research.  If it’s research you want, then you want to go to a research university, which GT definitely is. Olin is a teaching college, not a research college.

"Olin mom here.   It was a fantastic place for our son.   However, I often do warn that it is too teeny./limited (85 grads per hear) for most students.    If you want a more traditional college experience, GT may be better.   For completeness I will add more info about Olin too.
Olin grads do have decent prospects for internships and jobs.  The job fairs I think have more companies than annual graduates.   You may find this link helpful - http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/careers-graduate-studies/results/.    There will definitely be employers who have NOT heard of Olin, more so as you get further from Boston.   The various rankings can help mitigate that - http://www.olin.edu/about/rankings-awards/
Olin does have many projects, especially compared to my Engineering program in 1980s.    It also has intense academics, but not in the traditional course sequences.   Many Olin admits are highly qualified - some have turned down offers MIT, Stanford, Princeton etc.  So there is a presumption that they already have a lot of AP/IB knowledge under their belt.
Our son did do research at Olin (including the summer after Freshman year), but it was interwined with software engineering.  One project resulted in an award (with colleges that had more liberal arts kinds of CS than most STEM schools).  He also did poster presentation at a conference.  But these things were not due to intentional research focus - he intended to go to work, not grad school.

Olin students can also take classes at Babson (adjacent campus), Wellsley (campus loop bus), or Brandeis.
I think the approach to have an Olin Candidate’s Weekend  is wise.  (first cut of admits come to campus on one of 3 weekends) .    I was not able to attend, but DH (also an engineer) went. with DS… and after that, they both were smitten.
In Summary:  Olin can be a fine school if it is a good “fit”.    But it is a niche-fit, so students should careful study the pros/cons for their particular situation.

"@helpless2017 I will ask my Oliner your question, but I have a feeling others here can answer it easily. I see @NoVADad99 already took a swing at it. FWIW, the project my son is working on is run by a student, so I assume the author of the work will be the student. Changing topics slightly, when you’re looking at statistics about graduate schools and Olin try to factor in that many Olin students do some time in the workforce and then head for graduate school. They have an office of “Post Graduate Planning,” that assists students with post Olin planning and strategy (http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/careers-graduate-studies/). Finally, definitely check out the way Olin has produced Fulbright scholars. It may be interesting to compare Olin and GT by Fulbright recipients (while taking Olin’s smaller size into consideration).

This is what I’m disagreeing with, if for nothing else, because Olin is in Boston’s back yard.
I disagree more so because of the previous qualifying sentence that Olin is a hands on program while GT is a “world class research institution.” No doubt the latter is true, but the question is…what does that have to do with the undergraduate learning experience?
Olin is a direct response to large, yes very successful, research institutions, that don’t put the maximum priority on undergraduate education to produce practicing engineers. The great research schools like Caltech, Berkeley, Stanford, etc. are also known to have very large classes, lots of TA instruction and a lack of principle application. Can they produce good bachelors level engineers? Sure. Does their status as a research institution help that? I’d argue that it’s a hindrance.

"I still stand by the statement.  Olin grads get hired easily, but so do GT grads, even in Boston.  And again, you need to go back to the OP.

"I believe that the college experience should be used as a stepping-stone to the real world of a job/work life. This is more so in the case of being an Engineer and especially if you are a woman, unless you are in academia. The jump from a smaller, “more-cocooned” college makes this tougher in my opinion. The experience in smaller colleges and LACs is too much like an extended version of school life. Choose GTech !

"@helpless2017 I can’t speak to Olin specifically, but generally employers like well rounded applicants.  An engineering grad with project experience (and the leadership/teamwork/success/failure/etc that comes with it) is certainly desirable.  Keep in mind, though, that every engineering program includes a capstone project.  No matter what school you attend, you will graduate with project experience.  Research institutions are not just for research.  They can also turn out well rounded applicants.  As I said, Olin is great for the right person.  But it’s not the only great place out there.
I’ll give you a real world example of presence of grad students for connections.  My son happens to be at GT.  He recently applied for co-op with Coke, perhaps the most desirable co-op at GT.  His fraternity brother is now a grad student, who happened to have the exact co-op position last year.  Even had the same boss.

"Olin only has about 320 students … so sometimes I think of almost as a very large co-ed frat.   There is a tendency for students to stay on campus.   The academic and project load is intense (as it would be at GT too I’m sure), but the students seem to thrive on the challenge.   They are often on that Olin bubble, but liking it.   Having said that, my son did get off campus.  One of his research things was  joint project with Wellesly.    I’d guess he went to Boston about once a month.  He rode his bike and ran a lot too.   For him, most interests/ECs involved music, which he did on campus.   Oh yea, he also tutored some local kids and did a morning math(?) program at a local school.
“I love meeting new people and working with those who are different from me.” -   That definitely could be a concern regarding “fit”.    The Oliners have a wide variety of interests, more so than in many engineering programs.  But they are still all very STEM-focused.   To give an example, there is a Saturday night club called “Midnight Mathematicians”.   I kid you not… they meet at midnight and take turns presenting on math topics.

My D2 is a Junior now at GTech. Before she left for her first semester there I gave her one piece of advice/encouragement… enjoy college life and do well! It is not only a question of learning and preparing for the next stage of life but also making your best friends and savoring whatever your college has to offer beyond academic life. She has more than thrived at GTech and I am proud to say that she is ready for bigger challenges. Go Yellowjackets!

At GT, almost all the students I met had time for 1 or 2 afterschool jobs, and it’s pretty rigorous there, so I’m wondering how tough the coursework is
[/quote]

The coursework is voluminous and very difficult.  But the students are very smart and can handle it.  At orientation, the school stresses how hard it will be, and also stresses how none of you would be here if we didn’t know you can handle it.  But your point is true.  Many hold after school jobs, and nearly everyone participates in clubs and other activities, on top of seemingly endless hours of studying.  And they’re all better for it.  They very quickly learn time management, and naturally push themselves to excel at everything they do, as they’ve been doing their whole lives.  Employers know this.  When they hire GT grads, they’re getting someone very used to high workload and high performance.  This is true of many engineers, but especially prevalent at GT.
BTW, as example, my son works for a basketball analytics startup, is VP of the sports business club, plays for GT club volleyball, practices with women’s varsity, plays intramurals, goes to every basketball and football game, watches plenty of sports on TV, is active in fraternity with plenty of partying, and still finds time for all that studying.  His schedule amazes me, and he’s pretty much like everyone else there.

"I’ll let @colorado_mom speak for her kid at Olin.  My son has worked in the IT shop at Olin to earn extra money since his first semester.  He works probably about 15-20 hours a week, on top of his classes.  He is also in charge of the fundraising for the Baja Race Team this year, and will be going with the team to the annual SAE Baja Race event in Kansas this summer.  Last year he also did the Robotic Sail team but dropped it this year as the time commitment for it was too much.  He took a class at Wellesley last semeste.  He seems to be going to Boston or the neighboring area with classmates about every other week or so.  It all depends on the student and what passion he or she has and wants to pursue.  There is nothing at Olin to limit students if they want to truly do something outside of class.

"There isn’t a school where engineering is easy and everyone thinks their school is hard. In reality, the schools that ate notably harder than the test might boil down to one, Caltech. Their volume and pace are ridiculously high, and probably not to the benefit of the student (side note, two former Caltech profs told my son they wouldn’t recommend it for undergrad). Anyhow, back on track. Difficulty is not a metric that will meaningfully differentiate the two.
It’s true that Olin is a good school and unique. If you apply yourself and do well, you will have opportunities. What’s important to wrap your head around, is that statement is 100%, capital T true no matter where you go. To maximize your opportunity to thrive, fit then is the personal metric you should concern yourself with. If you’re a square peg, don’t pound yourself into a round hole. You won’t be happy.

"Olin comment based on recent questions/discussions above:

[QUOTE=""""""""]
TIME/JOBS - My son did have some minor campus employment (interesting stuff, but he did not earn a lot of money).  During senior year he continued his summer gig, a few hours per week remotely (and then went to same place after graduation).  All four years he did A LOT of EC, even though the academic workload/projects were intense.  However he often sacrificed sleep, not uncommon at engineering schools.
GPA - There seems less focus than other schools, partly because there is high demand for graduates.   The good thing is that Olin (and MIT and Harvey Mudd and I think some other engineering schools) have pass/fail first semester.  That allows students to get accustomed to college. Also they can learn that collaborative learning is good (and real life!) without worrying about who gets the top grade.   You’d think it would make students lazy, but they work surprisingly hard even in the first semeser.
“hand-on” - Olin haslots more project work than my engineering program and more than most other programs today.  It is not a vocation-tech kind of thing, w/o mathematical analysis. The technical analysis is often paired with practical uses.   I assume there is less probably less problem set kind of learning than I had.
FIT - It is important for a student to be a good match at any school.  But it’s especially critical at teeny school, even more so at Olin since the work is so hard.   It works best if the student absolutely loves the environment and the learning approach.   I often encourage students to put Olin on “the list” to learn more about project-based learning and hone their education preferences.   But due to it’s low acceptance rate and the fact that it is a niche-fit, I never push hard on it.
[/QUOTE]

Another thing I should mention is that small schools have few majors, so  opportunity for switching is very limited.   If you evolve to a major not offered, you need to transfer.  Due to Olin’s non-traditional course sequences, it might be hard to transfer credits.  (Not sure - a very high percentage of students stay.)

"Though I don’t have any direct first hand experience at Olin or GT, my D faced a similar decision. She was waitlisted at Olin and accepted into the GT honors program. So her decision was between a gap year + Olin vs. GT honors so not quite the same.
I agree with the veterans on this forum that the “fit” is extremely important. My D did love the Olin culture and family feel, the unique approach to engineering education etc. Only you can decide if there is a good fit.  Both of these schools are outstanding and though GT has a more recognized brand, most who know both schools know they are excellent and consider them peers. (I’m an engineer myself).
My D decided on GT. The gap year definitely played a role but she also felt like she will get the best of both worlds at GT honors - a small community with some small honors classes but in a larger school in a large city that has more opportunities. She knows she will have to seek out many things that would come easier at Olin though, e.g. she will need to get her project experience from clubs, etc.
Good luck with your decision!

And when I have seen him hanging with Olin friends they all seem to have a good sense of humor about Olin’s uniqueness. This is not to say they don’t love the culture, it is just that they are self-aware and mature about it.

"@fatherofsam I don’t think a fear of “losing” students is why Olin discourages signing up as a matriculating student at another school during gap year.

You may spend your gap year traveling, working, volunteering or studying (and that’s just to name a few ideas!). While you may take a course at another university, you may not enroll as a part-time or full-time student.

"A traditional gap year at this academic stage is getting admitted, asking for a year’s deferral, and taking a gap year. There’s another kind of gap year at Olin. Waitlisted students are told they might get in for the coming fall semester but, if not, they are guaranteed admission the following fall - after a full academic year. This is still called a “gap year” but it’s clearly different. I don’t think Olin is worried about losing these students to other colleges. They wish them the best. If some of them end up at another school, well, Olin has many other students available to fill a freshman class.  My waitlisted son knew he wanted to attend Olin. During his gap year he took manufacturing technology courses at a local community college and brushed up on math and Spanish at a local 4-year school.  The community college courses especially helped him realize he’s more passionate about mechanical engineering than computer science and software engineering. He also worked and lived at home. Not what he or we would have chosen but, looking back, an ideal year in his and our lives. It would have been less-ideal without taking those classes.

Yale students are generally brilliant so the question is if your competition are geniuses will you be able to do as well in the premed coursework there as at Pitt? And compete with them for internships, research opportunities?  This is not at all to belittle the quality of students at Pitt, which are of excellent quality too, but you can’t compare the selective admissions process of Yale vs Pittsburgh. I hear anecdotally that the premed curriculum at Pitt is very rigorous and achieving high grades there will be difficult as well. You should try and speak to some premed students at both schools and find out how good are the premed professors at each school and how are the grading practices is each. Sometimes the grading at the more selective school, such as Yale,  is higher than at a less competitive school, particularly a state school where professors seek to weed out a majority of the class.  This could help you make the decison. Med schools don’t care so much what undergrad school you go to as much as how you do in the sciences and what experience you obtain, showing a demonstrated interest in medicine. However if you decide to switch out of premed then Yale would provide more opportunity in my opinion. Also ask yourself if you thrive better as a big fish in a little pond (I.e., at Pitt)  or not?

Pitts requirements for the program include a minimum ACT/SAT of 34/1490 and they must maintain a 3.75 overall and science GPA. No MCAT is required. Given that there is a still a 50 percent drop-out rate with no MCAT, I would save the money and go to Yale.

"This is a tough call. They each have their pluses and minuses.
As awesome as JHU is, it has a rep of being a grind for premeds.  JHU for med or residency.  Not so great for undergrads.
Yale is tough on premeds as well.  I’ve told this story before.  When my son was a college freshman premed I ran into an old friend whose son was a freshman premed at Yale.  Her son was determined to go to med school and they were confident Yale would pave the way. The friend was aghast that my son was attending a mid-tier flagship and she voiced a lot of doubt about whether he’d get into a med school.  Fast forward a few years, her son’s GPA was not med-school worthy.  My son will be graduating from med school in May.
Don’t believe the hype about Yale inflation and that everyone gets A’s in their classes.  Maybe it’s that way for other paths, but the premed prereqs are still weeder classes at Yale.  Like every other college in the nation, they must reduce the number of their premeds.
As for UPitt @ucbalumnus is exactly right.  College is much harder than high school when in a serious major.  Adding premed path into the mix makes things even more difficult.  I have two premed parent forums and every fall parents are posting that their child-who’s-never-received-a-B-in-his-life is now struggling to bring his mid-semester C average in Gen Chem or Bio up to please-be-at-least-a-B.  These are kids who took the most rigorous high school schedules, took the zero period class, and were top 1-5% of their class.
I’m a little shocked that the 3.75 GPA req’t is “per semester” and not evaluated at the end of the year.  Bio, chem, and physics classes are usually 4-5 credits per class and a B in one of them can sink a semester’s BCPM GPA even if the student gets A’s in the other BCPM courses he takes that semester.
Considering that the Pitt program only takes the cream of the high school crop (poaching from Ivys), and 50% don’t make it thru, there’s reason to be concerned.
Of course a Pitt student who gets booted from the program can still proceed as a premed, get GPA where it needs to be and apply to other med schools later.  BUT…the $20k per year EFC may be an issue to the family.  Is it?

Lol…I can’t let that sentence pass.  We don’t have any “decent” med schools in the US.  All of our med schools are excellent.  There are about 145 med schools in the USA.  They all teach the same things; the education is flat. Any premed should be thrilled to get into any of them.  No one is too good for any of them.
My vote is for Yale. Cost-wise it’s better.  The Yale name will help if his career path changes.  Just remind him NOT to believe the Yale-hype about 90% of students get A’s.  That doesn’t apply to premed prereqs.  He’ll have to be self-disciplined.  Freshman have so many distractions and it’s their first time away from mom and dad.
If he gets at least a 3.7 GPA at Yale and scores well on the MCAT (sounds like he’s a strong test taker anyway), and has medically related ECs and some research experiences, he’ll likely get into a med school.  As a Calif resident, he’ll need to apply broadly and include some Midwest privates since getting into a Calif med school is crazy difficult.

His ultimate goal is going medicine. Going with the Pitt's GAP is obviously the way to achieve his goal in one-step shot in a top-10 med school, however, he is looking at about 20k/yr for four under graduate years (he's awarded 20k scholarship but we have to pay the out-state tuition since we are from California), vs Yale offered a total package with only 5k EFC. The other thing bothers my son is that for the GAP you have to maintain a 3.75 for each semester (both overall and BCPM), which means if you miss one, you will be out from the guaranteed medical school admission and end up with a Pitt undergrad education for roughly a cost of 80k in four years, where with Yale you will earn a Ivy undergra education with far less cost and may still get to a decent med school down to the road.

Also, we don’t know if other schools more actively limit who can/should apply to med school.

This is especially surprising since Vandy places significant emphasis on test scores on the undergraduate level and these kids should score well on the MCAT. The fact that other similarly ranked private schools have more kids enrolled in med school leads me to believe something is off about Vandy’s pre-med program. To spend $200,000 on tuition one would expect a higher placement rate than 66 percent especially since most of Vandy’s pre-med’s would have qualified for AU’s free tuition and 55 percent placement rate.

At Cornell Arts & Sciences you’d be taking a more traditional course of study. It also has a lot of distribution requirements.  My recommendation is to make a spread sheet of the exact classes you’d have to take (or requirements you’d have to fulfill) every year at each college. Which looks more interesting? Which one gets you more excited? That will make the decision for you (outside of the financial aspect).

Quant teams hire math degrees, (and CS is pretty much like a math major), physics, engineers, operations research. Finance is a plus but not a substitute unless it’s a quant focused degree as some b-schools have (not sure about Ross).
Also note, I have worked for 3 decades on the street.  My current employer’s President and many execs are Cornell grads.   A past employer was founded by a Cornell grad (who was also a board member at Cornell). There was a comment at the top of the thread about “if it was any other ivy”… Ridiculous comment.
Cornell is VERY HEAVILY REPRESENTED on wall street in many many roles with many different types of degrees. That is totally incorrect the ivy comment.   In fact I have yet to meet a Brown graduate in my 3 decades on Wall Street.   Lots of Harvard and Penn, but honestly in a quant role people are most impressed by MIT and NONE of the ivies     Also note while there are MIch grads on wall street, there are far more Cornell grads in NYC and better
networking opportunities as a result.

I worked in the quant and IT area of some of the largest best known banks and fund managers.

blevine, Ross requires 55 credits for the completion of the major. Students can take their remaining 65 credits in LSA, and double majoring in Pure Mathematics and Business is definitely possible. If the OP wishes to pursue a career in Quantitative Analysis, a double degree from LSA (Mathematics) and Ross (Business) would serve him/her well.
“Also note while there are MIch grads on wall street, there are far more Cornell grads in NYC and better

I don’t know about “far more”. Obviously, Cornell is a NY institution, and 35% of its alumni are NY residents, so naturally, more of them will be working in NY. But Michigan is very well represented on Wall Street. I would definitely say that when it comes to IBanking placement, Ross matches Cornell.

"@blevine, if you look closely you’ll find that those rankings you’ve seen are for college towns less than a certain population. Ann Arbor is larger so not part of that particular comparison.
I’ve visited Ann Arbor a few times recently. And will be going there a few more times yet.
Ann Arbor’s downtown is bigger than Ithaca’s. and it is easier to walk to, because there is no huge hill separating it from the campus. To me it feels more suburban, whereas Ithaca is more hippy-ish. Ann Arbor is very convenient to the Detroit suburbs, if you live there. And to Detroit. I imagine students do get some value from Detroit, but to me large swathes of it look to be in shambles. Literally.
Ithaca is surrounded by fantastic state parks, and has a very “chill” vibe to it that is hard to match, IMO. The campus is also beautiful. I personally love it there. I take vacations there. Nearly every year. It is clearly more isolated, but most students find there is enough to do right there, most of the time. To get the most out of your time there, it is best to have a car during the upperclassman years. Or have a friend who has a car. That is not required, but it enables one to more fully experience Ithaca and the surrounding areas far from the campus. If you want to get away for a weekend,there are daily buses from campus to NYC, and boatloads of students who are from the area traveling in the vicinity all the time. But NYC is 4+ hours away.
The person I am visiting in Ann Arbor wanted met o go to a football game. Because it is such a big deal there. The irony is that this person hates sports and wouldn’t apply to Cornell because it had too much sports.
There are certainly people at Cornell who go to all the football games. And, at least when I was there, were rabid about hockey. However a lot of people who attend Cornell would feel that this amount of obsession about sports is frankly retarded.So perhaps that’s a point of campus culture distinction.
It’s true that Cornell has a large alumni presence in and around NYC. The alumni club there is particularly active. Much moreso than those of our other alma maters. I’ve attended a number of interesting lectures they’ve sponsored.
I’m far removed from Wall Street by now, but at least based on my framework in antiquity I would agree with @blevine’s description. Except that, from what I saw, those quant jobs did not often go to people out of undergrad. Heck, the trading firm I worked for hired physics PhDs for those jobs. There’s a lot of money involved they weren’t messing around. Most of the undergrad hires I saw were  liberal arts majors from top schools.( Including Brown, BTW. Cornell too.)  And grads of business programs such as Wharton, NYU  and Ross. And also Cornell, even though at that time AEM was “Ag Ec” and didn’t have the reputation it has now.
Either way, to get a Wall Street job, in my day at least one would need to be exceptional. And “fit”. I suggest do not make your whole decision based on that. Besides after a year you might get turned on by psychology, or whatever, and completely change your objectives.
The new tech center in NYC is for grad programs. It is still in its infancy but I would not bank on it doing much for you, if I were you.

"There was some assertion that somehow Cornell is a lesser ivy on Wall street.
Nothing to do with Michigan.   Cornell is very heavily represented at all levels,
buy side, sell side and many types of roles.
As far as only having PhDs, yes a dept head and other highly paid researchers would be PhDs. But they do hire undergrads to do their rather high end gruntwork.   From there with experience, yes one might want to go back to grad school for mba or PhD depending on longer term aspirations.  Those PhDs will hire stem majors over b-school. Yes if you dbl major in a stem field, even better, and either college would allow study of bus and stem.  I have also seen people with undergrad only, move to portfolio management, prop trading out from reseach.   Point is stem is the better foot in the door for an undergrad.  If you excel, maybe PhD is the next step.  If less so, maybe work experience then MBA.   STEM undergrad degrees are more rigorous than undergrad business, and that would open many more  doors.   I have heard from Penn Engineers that they take Wharton undergrad classes, as easy electives, compared to their engineering courses.
There was an assertion that Ithaca is not a good college town.  Yes it’s small and isolated I agree, but a “college town” is small by definition.  Is Boston a “college town” ?   But there are many college students.   Not detracting from Michigan, but don’t knock Ithaca, many LOVE it. Personal preference.  If you want big, you can’t beat Boston as a college town, would take that over either.   But if you want an intimate college town, and love nature, hard to beat Ithaca.

With regards to college towns, I do not deny Ithaca’s charm. It is quaint, charming, safe, intellectual etc…At no time did I mock…or knock it. Ann Arbor is just a more complete college town. Small enough to be intimate, quaint and charming, but large enough to accommodate most types. The Detroit suburbs have much to offer as well, and having a large international airport 20 miles away makes life easier, especially for international students.

The first thing to remember when considering diversity is the regional student population. That is important because 50%-75% of all universities draw their undergraduate student bodies regionally. 35% of Cornell undergraduate students are from New York, and another 20% are from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Admittedly, the states of New York and New Jersey are going to be more diverse than the state of Michigan, and as such, it is only reasonable to expect Cornell to be slightly more diverse.

I guess it depends on your perspective and powers of observation. Combining African American, Latino, Asian, and International students, Cornell has a total of 46%, while Michigan is only at 30%.
It is definitely noticeable to me on campus that Cornell has over 50% more students in these groups than Michigan does. It may not seem to be that significant in individual categories, but Michigan is at the low end of the range in each category, and it adds up.
I think Michigan does a great job for a midwestern state flagship, but Michigan is viewed more as an elite national university than a state flagship, and by that standard, they are close to the bottom of the barrel in this category.

[/quote]

Bates does has a relatively low endowment by NESCAC standards, but I wouldn’t necessarily assume that this is “an indicator of alumni involvement”. I’ve heard that it relates, at least in part, to historical factors – specifically Bates’ attitude towards coeducation.
Bates has been coed since the mid-1800s, while most other NESCACs were all-male until around 1970. So Bates had a good 100-year head start on coeducation. Unfortunately, women didn’t generally have great career opportunities or earning power during the late 1800s and early 1900s. So for most of its history, Bates was at a significant disadvantage relative to the all-male NESCACs in terms of alumni fundraising.

"Hmmm, interesting, @wisteria100 . I don’t think of Hamilton as being more creative than Bates. In fact, I am impressed with how strong the arts do seem to be at Bates. There’s an actual Art museum on campus. But, you know my preferences, of course:-)
Bates is unquestionably liberal. I would not describe it as activist. My daughter likes that. There was a “get out the vote” effort during the election. I know people did attend the Women’s March in various cities. But no, not activist. My D thought Hamilton was preppy and that was a reason she decided not to apply there. There are preppy kids at Bates too, but I would describe most of the stduent body as leaning a little more urban, or a little more outdoorsy, mixed with geeks, athletes, and hippies. (D’s roommate is a total hippy.) Last year, Bates admitted 40 first-gen to college students. It works hard to increase diversity. That is one of the reasons why it went test-optional decades ago.
Great question about non-athletes, @hopeful1660 . D has found them, no problem. She has been with several groups of people from the start, and has now definitely found her people. None are athletes, though a couple of them are into ultimate Frisbee, which is apparently pretty popular. She seems to now have an ever-expanding group of non-athlete friends. The college puts on fairly regular campus-wide events and everyone comes and everyone enjoys them.
There is partying. Bates made Princeton Review’s list again for Beer drinking. My D says she doesn’t know why. She isn’t a big partier, and though parties happen, it’s not in your face. Or maybe she is hanging out with the wrong people! I seem to recall that she did say the lacrosse team has a lot of parties. Maybe the atheltes take the place of Greek Life?
I am not sure about your concern for the reputation. I would say that Bates and Hamilton are both highly regarded. They have nearly identical acceptance rates. I cannot imagine that any employer would ever consider one better than the other. Bates has a very active alumni network. There are many internships and jobs offered by Bates alumni. The new president, Clayton Spencer, has raised over $120 million for the college in just four years. It has beautifully modernized buildings, and some gorgeous brand new dorms that are a thousand times nicer than the ones I saw at Hamilton, but perhaps Hamilton’s dorms have been spruced up. There is, as far as I know, only one from that isn’t gorgeous, but even it was given a facelift last summer. It at least has large rooms. I do not think Bates’ endowment is an issue at all. Not sure if you have visited yet, but the campus and its buildings are beautiful.
Bates does have another big advantage, and that is its proximity to civilization. The college puts on free shuttles regularly to Freeport, which is a fun town with AMAZING shopping and restaurants. You will regularly run into kids from Bowdoin and Colby there. Also, free shuttles to Portland, which is a very cool small city. Once or twice a month, you can go to Boston for $20 for,the whole day. It’s only two hours away. Lewsiton is a modest town, but there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance and the kids go out. The countryside is very beautiful there, and there is a lovely wide river where the rowing team practices. Next to campus is a bird sanctuary where kids run, and it appears, have bonfires.
So you can tell I think it’s a great school. The retention rates between the two are very similar. You can’t go wrong with either, but after reading what you are looking for, you seem like a Bobcat to me:-)

Clearly, some places where Linda’s and my observations don’t overlap shows this variety.
“Urban” is an interesting word- in the sense that many have a comfort in various situations, have experiences to bring. But I think you’d find that at Ham, too. It’s a quality of the more selective NE LACs.
The heavy campus party scene may have diminished somewhat, as the new president announced she’d clamp down. My phrase, when mine were there was, “Work hard, party hard.” (Though D2 spent plenty of weekend evenings in the library. And D1 joked, Sun am, everyone is back to work.) At the same time, there’s a hard reason Ham made the frats non-res, parties in public areas.

It’s prides itself on inclusivity, and if you read its history, you will see why.
@lookingforward , yes, there are conservatives, and the NY Times managed to find a Trump voter during the election, which made me smile. Clayton Spencer has been true to her word, the paryting has been diminished. Trick or Drink is relegated to history. I think a lot of it has been due to improving relations with Lewiston. I know that a lot of Bates kids volunteer in the schools, not sure how recent that is.
Poor D didn’t even go out this weekend. She has three essays and two exams in the next few days. She is looking forward to playing with puppies and getting free massages so that she can chill out a little during finals week!
@hopeful1660 , just saw your post. No, D is not an athlete and has zero interest. Bates has about 40% athletes, I believe.

@Chembiodad Bates has an extremely high rate of grad school acceptance. It is number 5 in producing Fulbright Scholars. Cornell produced 15, Bates had 13 last year.

"As far as rankings go, @Corbett is correct. In addition, Bates has a long association with the African-American community, and goes to great lengths to recruit first-gen students. Along with being one of the first test-optional schools, it’s probably fair to say that all those groups were not traditionally associated with high-paying careers. It’s not so much the case now, of course.
This is from a NY Times 2015 article, discussing a study on the effect of test scores on GPA:
The study “found no significant difference between nonsubmitters and submitters in graduation rates (0.6 percent lower for nonsubmitters) or cumulative G.P.A. (2.83 for nonsubmitters, 2.88 with test scores).” Furthermore,
“Data also showed that nonsubmitters are more likely than submitters to be first-generation-to-college enrollees, underrepresented minorities, women, Pell Grant recipients and students with learning differences.” Again, traditionally groups of people that would be expected to earn less. Yet, it’s apparent that educational quality is not suffering.
I wasn’t going to make this long, however, I had to look. Bates and Hamilton have both produced 5 Rhodes Scholars. Yet, Bates is #5 in Fulbright Scholars, whereas Hamilton is #15. So it’s pretty clear that Bates is not a sub-par educational institution. It’s also clear that its student body might not typically be from as high-earning a background as Hamilton, which affects endowments, which affects USNWR rankings. Bates has a now-long history of being test-optional, whereas Hamilton does not, though it has modified its test requirements over the years.
Re the distribution requirements, that is something my D has found surprising. The requirements are soooo loose. D was given full credit for four of her AP classes. So she has already met some of the requirements, and said to me when choosing her courses for next year, that it feels like there are no requirements. She pretty much is just taking classes she is interested in.
At any rate, the whole rankings thing is clearly misleading, and a different thread. A different publication’s ranking will tell a different story. Anyway, OP, good luck with your decision. Either school is a great choice.

Re Deans list, just pride. When you go to a school with kids that are already pretty great students, it’s nice to be in the top:-) I am hoping she might apply to be a Fulbright scholar. That would be awesome.
D had seven scores of four or five, but they will give credit for a max of four. I think she got credit for French, Stats, English Lang, and Enviromental Sci. Not sure. She could have placed out of Intro Psych because she had AP psych, but chose to take it anyway.
She is doing an Oscar Wilde seminar for short term. No idea why she chose that. There are more interesting offerings, IMO. I would have chosen roller coaster physics or gone away somewhere, myself!
Re accepted students days, my D never cared for them. They are always a little artificial, no matter what school you visit. Her best visits were not at those events.

You’ll walk into the cafeteria or library and even if you don’t immediately know people, you will recognize people and invariably they will nod and smile vs being closed off into some kind of do not enter group.  At least that is how my D who is at a different LAC says it works!
You mention the prep factor at Hamilton.  When I toured with my D, she wasn’t feeling the prep, but that could have been because our tour guide was a bit boho/intellectual.  But she knows multiple kids at both schools, who would be considered kind of like urban/prep, but again that’s a small sample size and there will be outdoorsy and artsy kids at both schools as well.

"@hopeful1660: If you are asking me in more than a rhetorical way, I’d say that Yes the difference between a 25th percentile ACT score of 28 (Bates) and a one of 31 (Hamilton) might effect the classroom experiences at these schools.

However, my intent was not to emphasize standardized testing, but rather to simply point it out as one of the differences between your choices. I avoid placing colleges within any hiercharchy (and don’t understand what the number ten has to do with anything), but prefer to appreciate them for their singular attributes, where they exist.
Bates: Admirally founded by early abolitionists under severe regional opposition. Current administration seems committed to providing an inclusive, welcoming environment for all students. Compact campus on the edge of Lewiston.
Hamilton: Benefits from the curricular, architectural, spatial and, to some extent, cultural legacy of having been two colleges of different characteristics and attributes. A balanced curriculum, but also a writers’ college. Former fraternity houses are now beautiful residence halls.

"Higher test scores at Hamilton can also just be an indicator that high test scores are important to Hamilton. Doesn’t make the student body “better” or more interesting. Different schools chose to weight different criteria when deciding on who to accept. Bates’ very long term policy of being test optional shows it is not a factor they weight as heavily as Hamilton. The test optional policy at Bates isn’t some recent attempt to game the ratings game. My guess is they find little correlation between test scores and academic and career success.
Bottomline, you can parse data for weeks and, given the fairly even standing of both schools on many levels, it won’t matter as much in the long term as picking a school where you feel comfortable and supported. Could be either school or both.
I would spend some time looking through the course catalog. I’ve found big differences between LACs on course offerings. Even among similar schools, some schools have tons of courses that would interest me while others have ones that sound dry and boring, as much as one can go by course descriptions. Look at what might appeal to you in different areas of study. If you are interested in dabbling in some art classes, also check out how easy it is to get into a class as a non-art major.

I think we can fairly say that a higher test score means, per se, that you know more right now than a kid who scores lower than you.

I’m not sure you can even draw that conclusion. Some people are just bad at certain test formats that have nothing to do with knowledge. I have one of each in my kids. One kid has always been good at standardized tests, another not so much. The one who isn’t will often know the material but just doesn’t respond well to the testing conditions and format.

I’m sure there are a few students who don’t have scores to report, but overall one would expect Bates to have lower test scores than schools where everyone is submitting scores as a regular part of the application.

That’s not always an effective comparison, especially not at a ‘highly competitive,’ where the great mass of students are highly educated through high school, intellectually alert, have ideas about their futures.

But beats me how one then makes assumptions about which pool is brighter, more inclusive, or more apt to be the experience OP seeks.
I get that you’re trying to suggest the  lower scoring students at Bates are""""weaker"""" than at Ham. But, so what?  Bates isn’t scraping the bottom of the barrel; they’re looking at other than scores, in the first place. It’s common on CC for some to assume kids are hiding their scores, are truly weaker, if they don’t submit.  But that’s “the Kool-Aid.”  If one really knew these two colleges, they wouldn’t be trying to imply anything about Bates being lesser.
Bates is a little different in that community partnerships are popular. Not just service, if one chooses, but the opportunity, eg, to work with different sorts of local, state, or regional groups in hybrid participation, service and academic ways- sometimes on-going, sometimes for the senior project.  There are other contextual differences.  To try to boil this down to a projection that there’s a huge quality gap based on scores around the 25th percentile being lower is, IMO, futile.  It misses the point.

This reflects the complementary (and incorrect) figure. For the class of 2020, 79.5% of Hamilton  applicants, and 81% of those enrolled, submitted traditional scoring. For the class of 2019, which corresponds to the ranges posted by Apple 23, 83% arrived after having submitted traditional scoring.

Keep in mind that a reasonable number of Penn applicants who are deferred do get admitted in the regular admission round, so that may happen too. There is definitely a fair amount of overlap between Penn and Michigan student.
UVA definitely has more of a Southern feel, if that is interesting to him. It depends on what is comfortable for your student.

"My D also admitted to UVA and Michigan.  We are OOS she has been admitted to other schools as well, but has not made her decision.
I am a graduate of UVA’s Mcintire School of Commerce (admit rate is like 60% now and there is a tuition bump of 5K if you attend McIntire for your 3rd and 4th year, so that is something to consider).  Back in the day, The Comm School was amazing–great professors, case studies/group work, and a smaller school within the larger university).  Now, the school is state of the art and job prospects or grads are great.  I also think there is pre-law advising at UVA, which may be helpful.  Of course, my preference is UVA.  Charlottesville is a great college town and, at 16K students vs. 26K students, is much smaller than Michigan.  Most of my classes were pretty small (except Econ 201, etc.) and I think they are even more keyed-in on low faculty to student ratio now.  The campus is beautiful and historic.  She visited Michigan in Feb last year and it was -10.  Charlottesville weather is more mild of course.  As an alum, I am really hoping our March visit for Days on the Lawn is impressive and that D chooses UVA–not just because her mom attended!  Wahoowa!

"ryanordy98, Penn’s prestige edge over Michigan is limited to the uninformed (high school kids and impressionable parents). In academia and industry, Michigan and Penn are equally prestigious, although Wharton is obviously more prestigious than Ross and Michigan’s CoE is similarly more prestigious than Penn’s SEAS.
Also, the Detroit Metropolitan Airport is 20 miles away from Ann Arbor, and seldom takes more than 20-25 minutes to travel by car, except during rush hour.
As for Michigan vs UVa, they are peers academically. I would recommend going for fit as they are significantly different from each other.

"@penn95 you of all people coming from penn know that yield can be manipulated if hopkins were to take the same proportion of people ED (especially if they took more than 50% ala Penn). I too have friends that did pre-med (and are still there) at Hopkins as did my roommate, so I’d think being closer to the vest is more reputed than your third hand assertions.
Cornell selectivity is also not quite apples to apples since they have a CALS division.
What’s also clear is that Hopkins is enrolling more academically accomplished students (similar to what Northwestern began doing in the past) - while still maintaining yield, which makes the lower yield more impressive than Cornell or Dartmouth.  Hopkins also isn’t just taking high scorers with potential lower rank ala vandy (with 87% ranked in top 10%)
SATs of enrolled freshman:
Hopkins:
SAT (M+V old scale):1420 to 1570
Freshman in top 10%: 94%

At the end of the day, premed comes down to tests that are curved.  My roommate went to tons of parties and still did well enough to get into Columbia med with a 3.7 GPA from Hopkins.  Some of it is intelligence - another is time management.  In no way are students going out of their way to not help one another.  People know Hopkins is tough - but this fosters camaraderie since people have the same common goal.  The acceptance rate to Harvard med is like 3% - do people have much to gain by not helping their fellow man when 2 minds are better than one? I personally was not premed, but I was 1 bio course and 1 orgo course away from being one, and I did fine.
The only people that complain and moan about premed at Hopkins are ones that did not go there or had a tough time collaborating (luckily these are in the far minority).

Overall yield can be manipulated, sure, but RD yield cannot. Btw Dartmouth nd Cornell accept a % of their class ED that is similar to Hopkins.
For the class of 2020:
Hopkins RD Yield: ~27.5%
Dartmouth RD yield: ~37%
Cornell RD yield: ~40.9%
(Penn RD yield: ~50%+, only since you mentioned Penn manipulating yield - it does but still has a high RD yield)
Saying that Hopkins admits more academically accomplished students is just not true.
Dartmouth SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020: (670+680) - (780+780)
Cornell SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020      : (650+680) - (750+780)
Comparison to Cornell is not apples to apples since Cornell has some non-tradiditonal program that attract students with lower scores. Even that small difference does not suggest a actual difference in student quality. As for Dartmouth, it has slightly higher stats on paper.
Also many top schools do not solely focus on scores and GPA, they dont mind admitting some special students who have created a company or have done something else out of the box but have lower stats.

"@stevensPR The small difference could very well be explained by Dartmouth’s stronger athletics, strong legacy tradition and the fact that it is probably be more willing to accept very unique candidates with something special but not super high scores. Such an applicant is more likely to apply/attend at an ivy+ school than Hopkins.
yet it still doesn’t mean that somehow Hopkins students are more academically accomplished.
