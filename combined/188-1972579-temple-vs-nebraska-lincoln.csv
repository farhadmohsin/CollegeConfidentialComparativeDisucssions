@Lehigh2022 - Most students don’t borrow that kind of money.  Most students only borrow the student loans, and go to places that they can afford without loans bigger than that.  That is why nationwide most students go to community colleges or commuting distance 4-years.
The students who attend the expensive places have:

parents who have saved a lot of money to pay for college, or
parents who make a lot of money, or
parents who are willing to live on one parent’s income for four years and spend all of the other parent’s income on college costs, or
grades/test scores/other talents that will get them significant merit-based aid, or
family income that qualifies them for significant need-based aid, or
parents/grandparents/siblings/other relatives who are crazy enough to borrow and/or cosign big loans.

My kid went to community college for two years, and then to an in-state U, because that was what fit our budget.  She graduated with only the junior and senior year student loans.  We didn’t take on any debt.  This has not kept her from being successful in her career.
Run all the numbers that you have so far here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/awardletter.phtml
Look at what the loan amounts mean here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml
Then run the numbers again assuming you do your first two years at a CA CC, and finish up at a UC or CSU.  That may be your best option overall.

@Lehigh2022, happymomof1 describes the options pretty clearly. Students can’t borrow that kind of money and most parents shouldn’t. Most students commute to a local school.
Are there any colleges within commuting distance of your home? Did you apply to any financial safeties (schools you’re sure you can get in, can afford without loans, and would be happy to attend)?

The average is around 29k for FOUR YEARS, which is below the national federal loans numbers (27k over 4years with interest make 31k at graduation.) That’s the amount a college graduate can reasonably expect to pay back over ten years.
Not 25-30 per year.
So, to go back: what can your parents pay if they don’t take loans for you? If they pay from their income and savings and use the college’s payment plan to spread payments over ten months, what can they pay per year?

How much are your parents willing to pay per year?
If they can pay $15k per year, adding the $5.5k student loan puts your annual budget at $20.5k. Adding a summer job maybe puts your budget st $25k.
With that budget, you could afford Nebraska, SDSU, SJSU, and UNR – including fees and reasonable travel costs. If you desired additional “pizza money” and it would take you over that $25k budget, you could take a part-time job during the school year.

I was vacantly watching a hockey game on TV just now and running through some numbers in my head.
This is not directly related to your ability to afford college, maybe, but it could be, and it certainly could improve your ability to have fun in college and provide for your future:
Let’s say you took a 15-hr (per week) job making $10/hour. Let’s say you’re at Nebraska and the state/local taxes are low-to-nil, so you’re keeping about $130 of that per week. That comes to about $550 per month (since months average more than four full weeks).
If you adopted a “spend half, save half” mentality, you could:

Spend an average of $65 per week. That could buy you five pizzas, or two pizzas and two movies, or two cheap dates, or one fancy date – every week. You could buy a soda now and then, chips, candy bar, whatever. Aside from adding some “fun/food money” to your college experience, it would also teach you how to plan and execute a budget, which is a valuable thing to learn. A lot of people don’t know how to do that, go into credit card and other types of debt, and it causes major problems.
Save an average of $65 per week. If you are on campus for 34 weeks out of the year, that’s right around $2200 in savings. Or maybe you spend a little less or make a little more money, so you’re saving $2500 per year. At graduation, you’d have $10,000.

That $10,000 is $10,000 worth of access to opportunity and added security. It can help you put down a down payment on a house, it can come in handy if you are out of work for months, you can take a piece of it and do some traveling, etc.

If your EFC is &lt; $100, your parents likely can’t pay much and they shouldn’t borrow any. If they haven’t been able to save $80,000 for school, how do you expect them to repay that kind of money plus interest?
It appears to me that your resources are a ~$5900 Pell Grant + the $5500 student loan. That’s ~$11k. Do you have any schools whose net cost is within your budget? Look carefully at the packages to make sure they’re not already counting Pell and the loan.
Are there affordable schools in your home state of CA? Will you get any state grants if you attend one of them?

Two more things to consider:
Nebraska is in a tech triangle whereby a lot of start up tech companies without mega VC (or savvy about it) set up and hire graduates.
Housing is a big deal for Temple since you can’t live near campus. There’s a renovated block then you have to go farther away into the city and of course the nicer apartments aren’t cheap. (There’s why honors students having 4years of guaranteed housing is so important). So, investigate the housing situation.
