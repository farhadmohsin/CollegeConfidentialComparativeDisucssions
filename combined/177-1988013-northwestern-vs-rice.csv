I think Northwestern is a little bit stronger academically overall – very strong in STEM, social sciences and the humanities. Rice is known for its strength in STEM but I’m not sure it’s quite as strong as Northwestern elsewhere. That said, I’m sure Rice is adequate in the non-STEM areas. Assuming you plan on majoring in a STEM field, small differences in quality elsewhere might affect your electives but your major studies will be top-notch.
Is there a notable difference in cost? It sounds like you like them about equally.

I don’t think being near Chicago will give you more opportunities than being in Houston. Houston is a major city; it’s the fourth largest city in the United States (right after Chicago, actually!) and health, medicine, and biomedical research are  big drivers of Houston’s economy. I’d say your opportunities are roughly equal, at least in any sense that would matter to an undergrad. Rice does a lot of research and is located right next to the Texas Medical Center - but there are lots of other industries in case you change your mind.
I’ve only been briefly in both cities but it’s been my experience that moving around Chicago without a car is far easier than getting around Houston without one.
If you want something closer to the stereotypical “traditional” college experience - parties, big sports games, school spirit in spades - Northwestern is probably more likely to provide that, at least superficially. But in actuality, the “college experience” varies a lot from school to school and even from person to person. There are definitely people at Big 10 schools who haven’t attended a single sports game and don’t care a whit about sports. And college students everywhere like to party and make good friends, so you can find that at Rice, if you want!

Houston &gt; Chicago, and this will only grow over the next 30 years.  Rice is also in the nicest part of Houston proper.
As for prestige, I think it depends on who (and where) you ask.  There is no question that while both schools’ reputations have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, I’d say that Rice’s has improved more on a relative basis, especially in the South and West of the country.
Congrats - you really can’t go wrong with either, but I think I’d lean Rice for most fields of interest.

Interesting post by Satchel. I couldn’t disagree more. I have never, and would never, rank Houston above Chicago for anything beyond oil production and uncomfortable humidity.
But, even so, it is a personal decision.

Can you visit both schools for admitted student events before you decide? Both have gorgeous campuses. NW is on the lake while Rice is in the museum district of Houston. Rice will have nicer (not brutally cold) weather in the winter/spring, but NW will have nicer (not brutally hot and humid) weather in the summer/fall. NW has Greek life while Rice does not. Rice has the residential college system. Both have division 1 sports. NW has good spectator sports atmosphere while the Rice students mostly ignore the sports teams. Both are terrific schools.There are plenty of parties at both schools.  You can’t go wrong with either choice.

@college1114 - both are great schools. But, the unfortunate truth is that Rice’s great reputation in Texas doesn’t travel to the to the coasts well. In NYC (arguably, the world’s capital), you will often get a blank stare when you tell someone you went to Rice. And yes, this is even among a lot of educated people. As one of my good friends went there, I have great respect for the school and its students / alumni but the reality is that it is considered more of a regional school in the NE and on the West Coast. The reasons for the less than expected footprint is its lack of well known grad programs (Law, Medical, Business, etc) and its smaller class size that was historically 50%+ Texan. This means there are very few Rice alumni on the coasts. Rice is unquestionably a great school but Northwestern is on another level in terms of reputation, name recognition and general prestige. You have a ton of Northwestern alumni in New York, LA, SF, Chicago, etc. If you can endure a Chicago winter, then I think Northwestern should be the clear winner here. Also, Northwestern has significantly more geographical diversity - it has more students from California, New York, NJ, Texas and Florida in one class year than is the total size of Rice. And that combined with its Big 10 sports, very large endowment, top grad programs (Kellogg, Feinberg, Law School) and successful alumni across industries (Colbert, CEO of IBM, etc.) make it more of a well known name. Northwestern is the ‘safer’ decision here given its more established reputation across disciplines.

I beg to differ that northwestern is better known on the east coast then Rice. Northwestern is a mid west school. I went to Penn. I applied to Washington university. Knew of u of Chicago and Notre Dom but even when my kids applied didn’t really know anything about northwestern. Being from New Jersey I knew North Eastern, always got them confused. Rice I was always vaguely aware of because of its connection to NASA and to Kennedy and to science in general. I know that’s just me but I am not that unique. I just went through two rounds of college for my kids neither had northwestern anywhere on their radar and I don’t think anyone from their high school applied and HS sent multiple kids to the ivies every year. A good friend of my daughter got a full ride at NorthEastern and other kids applied there.Anyway I think Northwestern is even more known mainly in its region then Rice.

I can assure you that the opinion of @robotrainbow is not reflective of reality. If you look at her post history, her child enrolled at Rice – so some obvious bias there. And confusing NE with NU is analogous to confusing Penn State with Penn, which doesn’t happen among educated people. Look at the top NYC private prep schools / New England private prep schools / CA private prep schools like Harvard Westlake where these students largely can choose wherever they want to go and Northwestern will be in the top 10-15 most represented schools. Rice will not be found. Also, look at the top 10-15 feeder schools to the top MBA programs, and you’ll see Northwestern there. Look at Columbia, HBS, Wharton, Stanford, etc. Rice - no where to be found. Also, look at the incoming Investment Banking analyst classes in NY at the top banks - Northwestern will have a few analysts. Rice may have some students at the Houston offices but usually not in NY. Rice is a great school. But, it’s reputation just isn’t that strong on the coats. And considering that Northwestern is more selective / has higher test scores than Rice and AND has more students from NY and NJ in its freshman class than Rice’s entire freshman class (including Texas), I would beg to differ that Rice has a stronger reputation. Not even close.

Well the OP asked for opinions which would mean our biases, otherwise he would have just visited and not posted this question.  Anyway, I concur that for pre-med they’re about the same, but for other programs NW is better. This would matter if the OP switched majors or wanted to add a minor an unrelated field, say economics or international relations.  In that case, NW probably has more well-regarded programs.

@college1114 : 2 great schools; what a fantastic position to be in!  These are 2 of my HS jr daughter’s favorites. Have you gotten feedback on the relative ease of doing research as an undergrad at both? NU is more than twice as big enrollment wise, so assume you’d have more competition for research work–but would be good to check and confirm.
Average class size at Rice is notably smaller than NU, so seems like that’s something to weigh.  Some other things to check on would be the number of students declaring pre-med at each school, who your advisor(s) would be and their background/experience.  Re’ the latter, if you were able to talk to each school’s advisor and ask some open-ended questions, that could be really helpful–beyond their relative success as a “feeder” into med school.
Congratulations on gaining admission to both of these schools; what a compliment to your hard work and preparation!

And not realizing that the notion of “feeder colleges” is logically flawed shouldn’t happen among educated people - but unfortunately it does…

Just go with your gut! I think you can succeed anywhere, and both schools have good premed opportunities. Northwestern might have better sports if thats your gig.
Rice does have the reputation of “Happiest Students” which is crucial for your success! (I would have gone to Rice of NU if only I didn’t get rejected lol)
Rice also may have more inflation than NU, which can benefit you for premed. And if you want to go to Texas for med school (if your parents move or you get residency there) it is really cheap.
Anyways, it is great to have such good options, and both schools have marginal differences. Hopefully you visited but if you didn’t just try to choose by:
cost, weather, location (since the academics are pretty much the same), semester vs quarter, residential colleges vs frats, etc…
Good luck!!!

Another vote for going with your gut! Both are outstanding schools for undergraduates. It won’t make much difference for med school admission. If it’s true that Rice has more grade inflation, it may be better to be a premed there.
@robotrainbow
I understand that NU is not known to you and it’s easy to generalize based on your own experience. However, people with experience with law schools (T-14 law schools), business schools (consistently top-5), economics programs (consistently top-10 with 4.9 out of 5.0 in PA score), performing arts or journalism would likely know Northwestern. That’s covering a lot of people already even at the undergrad level since econ is usually the most popular major. You mentioned science with Rice; NU actually outranks Rice in most science disciplines and has one of the best chemistry departments in the world. Like it or not, reputation is closely related to graduate programs; when two schools are of the same type (mid-sized private research in this case), the one with better graduate programs by a good margin is going to have more national reputation. There are exceptions such as being an Ivy or an elite Catholic but neither applies to Rice.

I don’t know much about Northwestern (other than its high level reputation), as I have never visited and neither of my kids applied. I know quite a bit about Rice; I am an alum and my daughter was accepted into the Rice Class of 2022 and will be attending.
Here is some info on Rice, if you want to assess whether it is a fit:

research university with a distinctive commitment to undergraduate education; about 50% STEM, 50% humanities/social sciences
just under 4000 undergraduates
happily nerdy student body
very community focused, and many systems in place that support students and tight knit community - residential college system in particular
diversity is part of the Rice experience and mission; Rice seeks students who come from many different backgrounds and students who are comfortable with people from all different backgrounds
collaborative, supportive environment
A philosophy that “we are all in this together”; Rice is known for its “culture of care”. This is so important to Rice because Rice wants its students to continue care strongly about other people as they go into the world
Rice students and graduates are committed to making the world a better place

As mentioned in this thread, the location across from the Texas Medical Center is ideal for pre-meds. Undergraduate research is big at Rice. I just read an article about the three 2018 Goldwater Scholars at Rice this year. Lots of incredible things going on at Rice!
Another thing going on at Rice that many don’t know about is the focus on leadership skills for undergraduates. The Doerr Institute for New Leaders is available to any undergraduate who wants to develop their leadership skills. Take a look at the video: https://doerr.rice.edu
Good luck to you as you make your decision!

OP, please let us know which you chose.
Did you go with Evanston/Chicago and the overall academic machine that is Northwestern, or Houston and the smaller feel of Rice?
We spend days and weeks in these threads and half the time the OP doesn’t give us the result of our toil. It sometimes keeps me up at night, wondering.

About @robotrainbow not knowing about NU, despite being a Penn alum and also having gone through the college search with his daughter.
It’s possible.  I find it surprising, but I’ve seen other posts on these boards where people out east know Northeastern but not NU, or people who confuse the two.
Yes, most educated people know NU.  Also, a lot of people–educated or otherwise–know NU because of its affiliation  with the Big Ten.  There are a lot of college football fans.  There are a lot of NFL fans who may not care about the college game but sort of know that NU is a Big Ten school, Stanford is a Pac-12 school, Vandy is an SEC school, Duke is an ACC school (though Duke, of course, is much more known for its prowess in basketball).
I’m willing to bet dollars to doughnuts that @robotrainbow is not a football fan.  That’s not a knock.  Just a relatively safe deduction.
