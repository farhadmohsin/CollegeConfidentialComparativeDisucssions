@Amateurengineer – Congrats!
Is price a factor for your decision?  These are all great programs, and if the money is a factor, you should probably go with the one that is most affordable so you don’t have to take out debt.
Penn State is obviously a much bigger university overall.
You may know that NC State’s engineering school is on its own (relatively new) campus across a busy road from the rest of the campus.  There’s a frequent bus that runs between the two campuses.  This campus also has a lot of industry research sites which makes for a lot of neat cross-pollination between academic and corporate research. RTP is booming overall, and Raleigh is a great city and the campus is not far from downtown; there’s a lot fo do.
I’ve never been to Blacksburg, VA and only saw Penn State once a million years ago so can’t help there.  My S is interested in engineering (college class of 2025) and these colleges so I’ll be watching others’ responses too!
Congrats again and good luck!

All 3 of these universities have wonderful reputations in engineering. The thing that sticks out about NC State is it’s the only one of these 3 that is close to a significant amount of potential employers.
I know that it’s very possible to get intenships & jobs from a more-isolated campus…but when the employers are nearby,  it simplifies a lot of the interviewing, the traveling, the housing (especially for summer internships), etc. Also, I don’t know if internships during the school year are common for engineering students, but if they are, NC State would seem to have a clear advantage over the others.

All three have great reputations and will offer allot of opportunities.  They are all very large as well.  One has more winter, one is in the mountains and one has more seasons.  I attended NC State and have visited the others.  VaT is the prettiest campus, with the Hokie Stone buildings and mountain back drop.  NCSU Centennial Campus is very nice too and is where most of your engineering classes will be.  Be sure to check out the Hunt Library when you visit.  PSU campus is huge and very traditional (in a good way).  I went to a white-out game!  Had a great time.
Raleigh/Triangle will have more opportunity and more things to do in the area.
Visit and see which one feels the best.

All three are excellent for engineering.   Price and fit will be important.
Virginia Tech has a beautiful campus .  Large but not overwhelming. The main  engineering building is state of the art and built a few years ago.  There is a corporate research center in Blacksburg with lots of potential employers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_Corporate_Research_Center
Many national companies come each year to recruit at the  Engineering Expo, the career fair. Many Virginia Tech engineers do summer internships in Washington, DC,  Richmond, Roanoke, Blacksburg, etc.
Penn State, NC State, and Virginia Tech will all have very good employment opportunities .

You may want to investigate how challenging each program is…meaning how bad are the weed out courses.  I can only speak about PSU, but supposedly only 1 in 3 who start in engineeeing actually graduate with an engineering degree. It’s pretty brutal but that’s also why a lot of recruiters hire students from there. You could also compare the entrance to major requirements between schools. At PSU no one is technically accepted into their major. Rather they have to take a handful of required courses and hit a certain GPA before officially declaring it.

1 - I’m a parent of a Penn Stater and many parents of engineering students complain on the parents Facebook page about how their formerly 4.0 GPA kids are now struggling. Lots of weed out classes.  (And possibly a bit too much partying.). Google “PSU engineering entrance to major requirements” for details. Some majors require GPAs as high as 3.2.
2 and #3 - As your email or letter states, you were accepted into the COLLEGE but with an intended major...but not directly into the major.  You are technically in what PSU calls premajor status. To officially declare your major, you will have to successfully complete several courses with a C or better and hit a certain overall GPA, which varies depending on your major.  Civil engineering requires a 2.6 but biomedical, mechanical,  and chemical require a 3.2.  My advice is to go to office hours, sign up for Lion tutors, create peer study groups, etc.  and try to do as many math courses as possible at your community college over the summer and transfer them in. Just make sure you confirm with an adviser that they will be accepted before doing so.
4 - PSU engineeeing is super tough but they are in high demand.  Alumni network is the largest outside of Michigan and so the brand name goes far.

@Amateurengineer to answer your questions concerning riding the bus at NC State.  Most of the freshmen classes will be on main campus (the weed out classes as has been mentioned).  They are building a pedestrian tunnel to connect the two campuses.  They also stagger the classes between the two, so it is not a problem if you do have classes on both, which my sons did a couple of times.  And like PSU above, NC State engineering, your are accepted into the college but not the specific major.  Once you complete your first set of math and sciences, you apply to the major of your choice and it is based on grades in these core classes. Typically aerospace and chemical will be among the harder to get into.
Good Luck.

My vote goes to VT, but H and I being alumni might make us a wee bit biased. H actually turned down NC State for VT when he got accepted off the wait list, but that was a few moons ago.  H owns his own company now, so I think he turned out ok.
VT is similar that one gets into their specialty after the core courses unless they’ve changed recently.
The setting in Blacksburg is incredible. We loved our time there. It’s only improved since our day.
All that said, you could pick based upon finances or where you think you want to live once done and do just fine with degrees from any of your choices. We live in Penn State territory and know a fair number of successful grads from there too. Head down to NC where H is from and there are plenty of NC State grads doing well too.
Best wishes to you with your selection.

As an OOS student at NC State and VA Tech, total cost (not counting transportation and personal expenses) would be about:
NC State: ~$40k per year
https://studentservices.ncsu.edu/your-money/financial-aid/estimated-cost-of-attendance/undergraduate-student/
VA Tech: ~$43k per year
https://finaid.vt.edu/content/dam/finaid_vt_edu/Cost_of_Attendance/1920/COA%20OutofState%201920_UG.pdf
As an in-state student at PSU: ~$30k
That’s give or take a grand or so. So PSU would be about $10k-$13k less expensive per year, or about $40-50k less expensive over the course of four years.
I think PSU has a slightly stronger Engineering rep than VA Tech and NC State, though all are adequate.
So to me, I would choose PSU unless you fell in love with NC State or VA Tech to the point that the $40-$50k difference became a non-factor. Still, that’s a lot of money which you could use for a house down payment, grad school, traveling, investing, etc.

Pennsylvania is not Minnesota or even Indiana… it’s not so cold that you need tunnels! 
CS can be in Engineering or IST. Degree content is different.
If concerned about party culture, don’t join a frat (like 70-80% students); look for a wellness/substance free dorm/ quiet floor; honors dorm (don’t remember which name) has a quiet sound proof room and is a few minutes away from Engineering.

My daughter recently graduated from PSU with an engineering degree. She had incredible internships starting with the summer after her freshman year. She was offered a job before her senior year even started. If your con is that it’s a “party school”, live in the engineering dorm. It’s in a prime campus location (across from the shrine) and is a really good option for those who want a bit more of a studious environment. She is not a partier and still made a lot of friends, had a good time and ended up with a terrific job. You have a lot of great options - good luck with your decision. Exciting times!

@Amateurengineer great info thanks so much.
The question I had however is - do all freshmen take the same courses in first year
or for Mechanical engineering you have your own set of major courses and for CS I  have my own set - which is ok to do and we maintain the GPA for these courses. Its also  ok if there are a few general courses
However if both departments are taking same set of courses it means many will get weeded out from the major they want isnt it?
Purdue and TAMU and Vtech states clearly that first year is General engg where all freshmen take same courses right?
However Calpoly SLO - you are taking classes related to CS from Day 1.
I would like someone to confirm if at Penn State - all freshmen are taking same set of classes or the set of classes pertaining to their major with a few common ones. This is important for making my decision.
Can anyone please confirm?
