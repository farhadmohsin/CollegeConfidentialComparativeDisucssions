It’s $100,000 dollars over 4 years after tax. Roughly $125,000 in earned income to achieve.
If the $100,000 is not essential to your parents - emergency fund, retirement or for another child needing help for college in the future- then IU and Kelley School for a business career head start is better academically. UGA is pretty outstanding too. So if the facts above are not your family situation then UGA is the obvious choice.

You can still apply to the UGA honors program either in the next couple of weeks or once you start college if that is important to you. There is a benefit to being in the honors program at UGA with regard to registering early for classes, and it is sometimes difficult to get into certain classes without that extra advantage.

I work for the Atlanta office of one of the Big 4. You would probably apply for a job in the Atlanta, Charlotte, etc office. Work there 2 years and ask for a transfer to Chicago. A million years ago, I went to big SEC school, went to work for local office and then transferred to New York office. You could apply for a job directly to Chicago, etc office, but they will probably hire the people that had internships with them (and interns are usually from more local colleges). When I see the intern lists for Atlanta office, students are from Georgia State, UGA, Kennesaw, etc. Hope that helps!

Yes, you can request a specific office location but there is no guarantee. Much depends upon the area one is hired into & the need for associates at in that practice area at a particular office.
In one specialty, for example, associates & senior associates are in high demand at 26 offices in the continental US & can transfer to one’s office of choice in most cases.

OP: If you switched your major, then UGA is the better option due to significantly lower cost of attendance.
The value in your admission to IU is that you are a direct admit into Kelley, plus, to a lesser degree, admission into the honors college.

UGA’s business school is fine. Outstanding for insurance & risk management. Great for market research. An additional, and very important, strength is the proximity to internships and jobs in the Atlanta area.
The concern, however, is that it does not offer direct admission to freshmen (although not certain as things change).
“A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” (But is it worth $100,000 extra tuition?
Admission to undergraduate business schools is highly competitive due to the high costs & sacrifices required for obtaining an MBA in a full time program.

If you want to work on Wall st  Kelley has an advantage to kick open the door. And it is a top school of business in other areas as well.

Both UGA & IU-Kelley are great options. As a Direct Admit To IU-Kelley & to IU Honors College, it appears to be the better & wiser choice for your intended career path.
Your recent posts show that you are leaning toward the more comfortable option, but not necessarily the better opportunity. Are you afraid of leaving your comfort zone & facing the challenges of growing in a place where you will not have your current classmates & friends ?
IU has 34% from out-of-state, while the percentage of non-residents at UGA is 11%.

In another thread a poster noted that Bloomberg ranked IU-Kelley #1 for best teaching, student satisfaction, and, if I recall correctly, career services. The post was unclear as to whether this referred to the MBA program, the undergraduate business program or both. Probably both.
Kelley has offers some innovative, cutting edge & high demand specialties.
Nevertheless, I understand the charm of the South & the lure of Atlanta & Athens. But, direct admission to a high quality undergraduate business program is valuable, as is admission to the honors college.
P.S. Which school or program starts first ? Helpful to begin early so that you forget thinking about the choice & just focus on your new home.
It may help to see the housing options available to you at each school.

@grant123 I think you are looking at the academics differences between the two schools too closely.  Both schools have excellent accounting schools that Big 4 firms routinely and actively hire from.  Your career will start in Atlanta or Chicago, and both of those places are excellent for career growth.  Both schools are respected by people inside the industry, but people outside the industry just see state school.
How do I know this?  I graduated from UGA with a degree in accounting, moved far from the South, and now my wife’s best friend is an accounting grad from IU.  Go to the school that you like the fit, can get into the accounting school, and survive the accounting school.  A lot of kids get washed out of the accounting program at both schools.

If the cost difference over 4 years is this substantial, then UGA is the better option.

@grant123: A difference of $25,000 to $27,000 per year is too much. One reason that I was unsure of the cost difference is that some state schools waive non-resident tuition surcharge (meaning a non-resident would just pay in state rates) if awarded a scholarship of any amount, including as little as $500. I cannot recall the state that was well known for this. (Not sure, but I thought it was either Iowa or Indiana. I was familiar with this regarding law school admission.)

@grant123: Getting into undergraduate business schools is much more competitive today than it was 10 years ago. Part of the reason is that many refuse to pay high MBA tuitions plus sacrifice an income for 2 years during a full time MBA program. Today, many expect an undergraduate business degree to deliver what an MBA used to be used for. This has also given rise to one year specialty masters degrees in business such as marketing, marketing research, finance, data analytics, etc. instead of pursuing the traditional 2 year full time MBA.

Please stop telling the OP that they will be limited to Atlanta and the South if they go to UGA. That’s completely false. My D is at UGA and many of her friends got internships and full time jobs in NY with companies like Deloitte. If they wanted NYC, they got it. Many want to stay in Atlanta. So if you want to go to NY, those opportunities will be there. Terry is an excellent business school and will not hold you back. Their placement is excellent. IU, while an excellent business school, does not offer significantly better opportunities than UGA. My D turned down a full ride at IU for UGA and has no regrets whatsoever and has not seen any difference in business school quality as a practical matter (and not based on rankings).  She has a tippy top internship lined up for next summer. Choose the school that is the better fit, go there, and be excellent.
Btw, while Terry is competitive entry, most students have no trouble getting their first choice major. Look at the admissions requirements and educate yourself about what is involved. Entry isn’t difficult.

Just FYI, please talk to people with actual experience and not just those who read rankings. Most of my D’s friends are in Terry but are neither FFR nor honors. The ones that graduated last year and the seniors had/have excellent internships and full time jobs lined up by senior year, comparable to IU. Most Kelley grads stay in the Midwest (Chicago mostly) and Terry grads stay in the South (Atlanta mostly). That’s typical for big state schools.  Average/median salary differences not significant to begin with and are nonetheless due to cost of living differences. I would not decide based on USNews business rankings. Both are top notch business programs and your outcome from either will depend far more on what you do in college rather than whether you attend the higher ranked business program (IU is higher by 11 spots, which isn’t worth even close to $100k difference). Also consider the difference in curriculum when considering fit.

I think that advising students that membership in an honors college should not be a factor is incorrect. Also, it is important to distinguish between business honors & university wide honors programs.
Please remember that many posters have sons & daughters & nieces & nephews at UGA & may have different, yet well founded, experiences & knowledge to share.
OP: It is fairly easy for you to check out recruiting at IU-Kelley versus UGA-Terry. An important factor relates to size of each schools’ respective MBA program.
UGA-Terry has about 103 full time MBA students while IU-Kelley has about 392 full time MBA students.
.
IU’s MBA program has higher admission standards than does UGA-Terry.
It is easy to verify which school attracts more recruiters.
Also, recruiting/placement opportunities are different for the approximate 20 Foundation Fellows at UGA then it is for other students so Deloitte & MBB & New York City recruiters are not banging down the doors at UGA.
Nevertheless, the cost difference of $25,000 per year is substantial–even though it may be affordable for your family.

With respect to MBA school, the best programs typically demand 3 to 5 years of post undergraduate work experience. Certain firms & companies feed more employees into M-7 MBA programs than others. So, for a variety of reasons, post undergraduate placement is important. Because of Atlanta’s significance in the business world, great opportunities are available in Georgia. Because of IU-Kelley’s reputation, standards, programs & size, great opportunities are available from IU-Kelley.
And, yes, I understand that you are not in the MBA program at either school, but you can benefit from a strong MBA program as an undergraduate business major in a variety of ways.

I just checked the minimum qualifications for IU-Hutton Honors College. Either a 32 ACT score & top 7.5% of high school class, or 34 ACT score & top 10% of one’s high school class. The benefits regarding advising, class registration, special courses & housing can be substantial if one takes advantage of all that is available to them as honors students. In my opinion, the most impact is made during one’s freshman year. You are in the Honors College at IU, but not at UGA.
In your sophomore year, as a business major, you may should eligible for Business Honors at IU. Very important for internships, job placement, advising & teacher recs.
At UGA you are neither a Foundation Fellow nor a member of the Honors College.
AT IU. your 32 ACT score just made the minimum cutoff for the Hutton Honors College. The students with whom you associate while in business school can be important–especially with respect to joining business clubs that match your interests & result in internship & job placement interviews.

In your sophomore year, as a business major, you may should eligible for Business Honors at IU. Very important for internships, job placement, advising & teacher recs.
At UGA you are neither a Foundation Fellow nor a member of the Honors College.
AT IU. your 32 ACT score just made the minimum cutoff for the Hutton Honors College. The students with whom you associate while in business school can be important–especially with respect to joining business clubs that match your interests & result in internship & job placement interviews.

@Publisher  My D attends UGA now. I’m posting current information. You have no idea the students I’m talking about. I’m not talking about other Fellows. I’m not sure where you keep getting your misinformation. I’m also not sure why you are always posting non-responsive information about MBA programs when a student is asking about undergrad. It’s not relevant.  At all. You are very misinformed.
Funny you talk about Fellows now when the first time I saw you on a thread you swore Fellows had no chance at top companies.  Please stop.
Your information about IU is also incorrect. As my student was heavily recruited by Kelley 2 years ago and took classes at IU, I know what I’m talking about.  Where are you getting your misinformation? I’m starting to think you’re a student with too much time on your hands.

Sorry that you feel that way. I am not a student. And you’re guessing in post #56 is wildly incorrect. Also, the information that I have offered is verifiable.
As for relevance of MBA programs, I agree that it has little impact at UGA, but disagree with respect to IU-Kelley.
Again, please understand that others have valuable insights, experiences & knowledge to share about UGA.
Getting lost in this discussion is the fact that the OP is not even in the business school at UGA.

MBA placement numbers are publicly available for both UGA-Terry MBA grads & IU-Kelley MBA grads. The average starting salary & signing bonus in 2017 shows a significant difference between the two schools. IU-Kelley MBA grads started at an average of $120,649 while UGA-Terry MBAs started at a much lower $100,200 despite being within 75-90 minutes of Atlanta.
And, yes, this is MBA, not undergraduate business numbers. You should be able to get placement & internship info. from each respective undergraduate business school.

If $25,000 per year is an amount that can be handled by you & your family without difficulty or loans, then the benefits of the Hutton Honors College at IU, the benefits of Business Honors at IU-Kelley and the benefits of Direct Admission to a major US undergraduate business program (IU-Kelley) are worthy of serious consideration.

Midwesterner here whose daughter is considering both IU (Kelley) and UGA. Got deferred at UGA but easily accepted to Kelley and also into Hutton. Kelley is great and all, but UGA definitely more competitive overall than IU. Outside of Kelley IU is a pretty average school academically. UGA getting tougher and tougher to get into. Deferring out of state kids with a 34 that have below 4.0 unweighted. I think some may be exaggerating the difference between IU and UGA’s business. Again, Kelley is great but it’s no Wharton. To get direct admit into Kelley you only need a 30 and 3.8 and are guaranteed DA. And that’s superscore and weighted. Although I think Kelly is great and would love to see our daughter land there, in your situation UGA seems to be the clear winner especially considering it’s a $100,000 difference. Unless you’re really looking to move to a different area of the country.

UGA has competitive admissions because of the Zell Miller scholarship for qualifying Georgia residents which covers tuition & fees. (Used to be called the Hope Scholarship, I believe.)

I can bring a little perspective into this OSU, IU, and UGA… All these schools are very similar in the sense that they are all large Public with a lot of rah rah rah and outstanding academics.  Daughter had the same dilemma last year. She was accepted to all these schools as well as other similar ones. She knew that money was going to be the deciding factor. She was a direct admit to Fisher and she was also able to secure a full-tuition scholarship at OSU bringing the overall cost of attendance on par with UGA (we are instate).  She was also interested in going out of state, Her acceptance to OSU and UGA came in at the same time (the Friday before Thanksgiving). After researching all the programs, acceptances, financials, and location, there is no doubt in my mind that she made the right decision. She absolutely LOVES OSU.
Financially speaking, OSU will be cheaper than IU by about $10K to $12K a year. So basically somewhere in between UGA and IU. Fisher is an amazing school perhaps not at the level of Kelley but very very close. Columbus is a city, but by no means, the size of  Atlanta, but lots of Fortune 500’s as well as upstarts are based out of there. It is between Cincinnati and Cleveland not to mention other major cities such as Pittsburgh and Indianapolis. After narrowing down some of her options, she decided that she wanted to be in a city.
We looked into Kelley and, it seems that a lot of people think to think they are tops.  IMHO, I do not think they are worth the premium, especially if you are not studying Finance and assuming, of course, you have similar options.  I know you have your hands full and this is not an easy decision. The University of Georgia is an amazing school and it probably would have been the school of choice if she did not attend OSU.  But there is something to be said about Direct admission and wanting to go OOS. But financials matter.   I know you have a lot of friends attending UGA or are going to be attending UGA, but if you want to hear the perspective a current Fisher student from Atlanta, I will be more than happy to get you in touch with my daughter. In addition, I know all these schools offer acceptance students days, etc. You might want to consider going to those in order for you to make sure you get a feel for what is like.
Finally, when she came home during the winter break, she had a chance to see all her friends who are currently attending other schools from all over the country. Schools such as Wisconsin, Arizona, Alabama, Texas, FSU, and UGA. EVERY SINGLE ONE of these kids loves their schools. They all found the perfect school. It goes to show you that by the end of the day, we all seem to struggle with these decisions, but whether location, financials, or size dictate the outcome, many end up very happy with their ultimate choice.

Of course the cost difference is substantial. That is the only reason that this thread exists. But at IU-Kelley & Hutton Honors College & Business Honors, you will get a much different experience than your other options.
If the difference in cost will necessitate taking out loans of any amount, then go to UGA for room & board. But, if the cost is not a substantial concern to you & your family, then you have a choice to make based on other factors.
P.S. Again, you have verifiable numbers & placement info. about IU-Kelley. And an available resource in @iubaccounting for accurate up-to-date information. Use those resources when deciding about your future.

P.S. Again, you have verifiable numbers & placement info. about IU-Kelley. And an available resource in @iubaccounting for accurate up-to-date information. Use those resources when deciding about your future.

I checked P&Q’s December 12, 2018 ratings & rankings of undergraduate business programs.
Starting pay difference last year was only a difference of less than $12,000.
IU-Kelley undergraduate starting pay averaged about $69,300.
UGA-Terry undergraduate starting pay averaged about $57,850.
Among the 88 undergraduate business schools rated & ranked by P&Q, IU-Kelley had the 11th highest average SAT score, while UGA-Terry had the 45th or 46th highest SAT score average.
Internship placement rate at IU-Kelley was 91%, at UGA-Terry it was 85%.
A large part of your decision, therefore, should be based on what type of undergraduate college experience you want. IU-Kelley will be business & academic focused. Your new friends will be business students & Hutton Honors College students for the most part. Followed by Business Honors in your second year & thereafter.
At UGA you will have the comfort & familiarity of your high school friends & the advantages of being close to home. Business school will come in a year or two. And you will have a substantial sum to put toward graduate school.

In another thread, posters are discussing undergraduate business school rankings regarding two other midwestern universities. In examining these rankings (US News based on business school deans & program directors surveyed), Indiana-Kelley shines.
IU-Kelley is ranked in the top 10 for accounting, finance, management, MIS (management information systems), & marketing.
UGA-Terry is ranked in the top 10 for insurance/risk management & real estate.
OSU-Fisher is ranked among the top 10 for production/operations mgmt., supply chain mgmt./logistics, & accounting.
All of these undergraduate business schools have their strengths.

By the end of the day, these are all good Business Schools. I honestly do not think Kelley is worth the premium over many similar schools. When we went through the process last year, the one thing that we got out of the acceptance visits was the ability to be able to get an internship.  It can be quite competitive, but after everything is said and done, it all comes down to the individual student, grades, and desire. All these students are fighting for the same internships.
As another poster pointed out, many seem to think that Kelley is as prestigious as Wharton. Not even close! It is not nearly as difficult to get into Kelley or IU as it is to get into Penn. I often hear “where do you go to school? I go to Kelley”  Please!!! Having said that, Kelley is a great school and IU is a great University. But overall, if the student is not a 100 percent sure that they are not going to stay in the Business School, the other schools have a better overall reputation. Also, when comparing pay scales between say Kelley and Terry, you have to remember that Kelley tends to send a lot of kids into Markets such as Chicago and NYC whereas UGA tends to send more students into Atlanta, Charlotte, and smaller cities in the South. The pay scales are different.
The OP and many who are in similar situations have to decide what makes sense to them. There are so many students whose parents can afford to send their kids just about anywhere. The difference between $100K to go out of state or stay instate might not mean anything. Is Kelley worth $100K more than UGA? Probably no.  But there are so many factors to consider.  The fact is that the in-state school will always cost much much less than the OOS school unless the students can secure close to an OOS waiver in order to make it somewhat cost competitive. So anyone applying to an OOS public should know all the scenarios.
Also, there is so much information out there in regard to scholarships, acceptances, etc.  It is a known fact that OOS applicants to IU with target scores can qualify for a scholarship that amounts to about $10K. The Ohio State University tends to offer about $12,500 and sometimes a little more with their Buckeye Scholarship. Anyone prior to applying should have known that there were going get x amount at IU, OSU, and UGA and with that all the what-if scenarios.

Maybe many people can afford $100k but as with anything what you don’t spend a 100k on can be used elsewhere.  While college is not like a car or a house its the same principal do you want money left over or not.  Do you buy the most you can qualify for or do you save the money?  UGA is an excellent school and as in state student you pay no tuition with the zell.  If something were to happen to a parents employment or its a difference of their retirement it does come into play.  If 100k does not matter to a family that is one thing but to many that is alot of money especially when there are multiple children to educate.  Then there is grad school to consider.  Or down the road a possible large down payment on a house if not spent for education.

Grant: If in doubt, go to UGA for free. Enjoy college & your friends. Join a fraternity. Have fun. It’s okay to do so at this point in your young adult life.
I know many students who are very academic & career focused. For them, the Honors College & the business school environment is motivating, exciting & working toward their career goals.
You have mentioned briefly that business may not be your ultimate major. If undecided, then why invest the money at this stage of your life when you can use it for grad school or anything else ?
After a few brief communications with you, I encourage you to stay close to home & be with your high school friends & enjoy all that Athens & a rollicking SEC school has to offer.
If I thought that you were a bit more formal (for lack of a better word). I would suggest the University of Alabama Honors College or Auburn.

Remember most students change majors.  And if you are indecisive now you may very well change majors.  My daughter just graduated college in a major she never heard of until after mateiculating.  My son is a senior and if not accepted to GT will be more than likely going to UGA.  As a GA parent I know kids from both these schools have excellent opportunities.  Life is short and college goesquickly pick where you will be happy.  When you are happy people tend to excel.  And remember there are highly successful people from all universities.  Its more what you make of it then where exactly you go.  And my daughtet said no way to ever going to grad school and is now getting her masters

Former President of UA told us that he modeled the UA’s University Fellows on Georgia’s Foundation Fellows. He moved on to become Chancellor & UA’s University Fellows benefits got a bit watered down sometime thereafter.
FWIW: My two favorite undergraduate business schools in the US are Ross & Kelley because both are so well run & well established, plus both are located amid great university environments.

No way is IU a “no brainer”.  With a $100,000 price differential, most people will give serious thought to very good, less expensive options such as UGA.  If the OP’s family is truly wealthy (like top wealth), that is a different story and kids go anywhere they please. After all these posts,  I’m still unclear what financial impact going  to IU would have on the family, whether or not there are younger siblings to educate,  Maybe I missed that.  Ideally,  financial limits are sorted out before applications even go out.

You seem to think there is a much more studious atmosphere at Kelley and that honors college students don’t party. Allow me to disabuse you of those ideas. Kelley students and IU students in general party hard, including those in honors. McNutt (where the Kelley LLC used to be located) is party central. UGA is the same. Most schools are the same. The OP can have fun at both schools and receive an excellent business education. They aren’t mutually exclusive. By choosing UGA, the OP isn’t saying he/she is any less academic/studious or career-focused or motivated. Step away from the rankings.

Pretty sure that OP’s family is comfortable enough to afford that amount. I have dozens of relatives in the Atlanta area. They do well, but don’t live on West Paces Ferry or in Buckhead. And that amount is within their budgets without taking out loans or making any lifestyle changes. Very bright, hardworking people. But even they send their kids, for the most part, to UGA & Georgia Tech. Both UGA & Tech have a lot of sophisticated & bright students. And Atlanta is a great place for internships.

If money is NOT an issue, Kelley is the better choice and it will allow the OP to experience what is like to be in a different part of the country with students from all over the place. Kelley attracts students from all over the country. UGA does not offer that kind of diversity. By no means, Kelley is Wharton or Michigan Ross, but it does attract a lot of students who had to consider those schools and probably did not get in.
Kelley is known throughout the country whereas Terry is much more regional. I think the OP should visit OSU Fisher as well if visiting Bloomington. They are about 3 hours away from each other.

@grant123 A few pages back I posted about being a UGA accounting grad and my spouse’s best friend being an accounting grad from IU.  You asked if I liked UGA.  Yes, I did love UGA and the accounting program set me up for success, but that was 27 years ago and I am not you.
After reading all of the new posts I have to reiterate what I posted earlier.  For accounting there is not an academic difference in these two schools.   Employers have been hiring from these two schools for decades and have been shaping the curriculum for decades, and that gives the programs a trade school like feel.  Rankings matter, but when you drill down to something specific like accounting it’s more about your chances of landing a great first job.  Both schools will be heavily recruited by top accounting/consulting firms.
MBAs were mentioned earlier, and I would recommend not considering that.  I would recommend a masters in accounting, and then after a few years out in the real world decide if you want an MBA.  Both schools will allow you to attend an excellent MBA program.
What brought me back to this thread was that I had dinner last night with the IU grad mentioned above.  We both agreed that within accounting groups our degrees are respected, but outside of that group it’s just a business degree from a state school.  Both of us loved our time in college and feel like it set us up for success.
Good luck in your search!

Agree that for those studying just accounting, most any accredited school will suffice. But for those venturing into a double major such as accounting & finance, then quality of the finance program & its students does matter.
Not discussed in the post above are the tremendous benefits of IU’s Hutton Honors College–regardless of one’s major–and the benefits of Business Honors & its clubs as well as advantages of being a direct admit to the business school which enables one to build meaningful professional relationships from the first semester on campus.
Recruiting has changed over the past 27 years. Best to be part of a nationally respected business school if seeking competitive positions outside of the school’s geographic region.
Telling one to disregard the affiliated MBA program at each business school is very poor advice with respect to the rapidly evolving changes in marketplace demands. It is almost as ridiculous as an earlier posted who suggested that you ignore the advantages of the Hutton Honors College (to which OP barely qualified). The people with whom you associate during your college years will have a dramatic effect on both your undergraduate experience & upon future professional connections.

@alwaysmoving made a great point in her post above : “and I am not you”. This is true for all of us except the OP.
If costs were equal or close, then it would be foolish to turn down the opportunities, benefits & stature of attending IU-Kelley & the Hutton Honors College. But OP is young & needs to determine whether he wants to relax & enjoy during his first year or is ready to study & build career connections. Both paths are fine. Just no need to spend the extra funds if not ready to take advantage of being a direct admit & Hutton Honors & working toward Business Honors.
Worth repeating: Recruiting & job placement & internships are much more competitive & involve more preparation & planning than was necessary 27 years ago.

@alwaysmoving: In your most recent post in this thread, you recommend against getting an MBA in favor of a Masters in Accounting for an accounting major. Why ?
The Masters in Accounting has become a widespread offering due to the increased hours required for CPA license eligibility.
Wouldn’t it be better for an accounting major to get a specialty masters in order to expand their attractiveness to employers ?
Also, the Indiana-Kelley MBA is just a one academic year addition–just like a Masters in Accounting–so it is worth investigating even without the typical 3 to 5 years expected by the elite MBA programs.
So my question is: What good is a Masters in Accounting for an accounting major beyond getting the additional 30 hours for CPA license eligibility which could be accomplished by earning a specialty masters ?

I don’t want to hijack the thread, but hopefully answering your question will be valuable to the OP or another viewer in a similar situation.
A masters in accounting has become the norm for someone staring out from schools like IU or UGA.  It’s not required, but it’s definitely something that you should get while you’re there.
Why not a MBA?  The OP will take a variety of business classes and have a solid base in management when they leave school.  Plus there will be ample on the job training in their first 5 years.  Adding an MBA after those 5 years might be helpful, but most likely it won’t.  Getting an MBA after a MACC will most likely cause employers to think you are chasing credentials, and that is a dangerous tag these days.
So what extra education would I recommend to a an accounting grad?  Something in tech like a coding or software engineering bootcamp.  More and more the people around me tackle business problems like a software developer instead of like an MBA, and understanding that methodology and terminology would be beneficial.

There are many specialty masters available. Can be in data analytics/data analysis, finance, management, taxation,etc. No need for a MAcc for one with an undergraduate accounting degree.

DS is also deciding between IU and UGA. He is also a OOS w/DA to Kelley and HHonors. We just attended Kelley DA day and he shadowed a HH student for the day. We will be attending UGA Honors Admit Day and will meet with Terry for a second time. DA into Kelley is attractive, but Honors at UGA seems to have more opportunities. DS received scholarships from both IU and UGA, with UGA being slightly less per year. He was also accepted into McCombs and UNC, but no merit scholarship making them more $. DS is looking for something more than just a great bus degree, perhaps something with Environmental Science, Public Policy and whatever else he can get his hands on. He is planning on eventually getting MBA.

@publisher, Zell MIller scholarships are not HOPE scholarships. Zell has a higher high school GPA and SAT/ACT cutoff, as well as a higher college GPA benchmark to maintain funding. Some students can get merit money from UGA beyond the Zell Miller.
My niece went to UGA (BA, BS) and just finished her MA. If you were my son/daughter, you’d need some very compelling, mature and enthusiastic reasons for Kelley when UGA is so affordable.
