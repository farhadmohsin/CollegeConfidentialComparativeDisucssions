Honestly I’d just stay one more year and graduate from ND even if you don’t love being at the school.

If you are leaving ND because of the weather, Boston wouldn’t be much improvement. It really depends on what type of school you want. Student vibes, size, and location should decide for you!

If the goal is to be able to better access the sorts of internships that will be most relevant for your career, I’d think that Boston would be the better fit.

BC is not worth $10k more than UNC unless you feel like the fit is much better there. If you’d strongly prefer being in the Boston area, the private school feel, and other pros for BC make it the much better choice, then spend the extra money.
If they are tied or close to it, I’d suggest UNC based on the savings.
I think they are a wash academically and rep-wise for undergrad – and both are really solid in business – so either way, you should be fine academically.

How is BC different from ND? They are identical! You cannot get two mot similar universities. Both are Catholic, both have 9,000 undergraduate students and 4,000 graduate students, both have a proud football tradition, both have loyal alumni  and both have equally cold winters. Boston College is close to a mid sized city while Notre Dame is not, and that’s where the differences end.
UNC would be a different experience. Secular school in warmer weather.
I agree with those who recommend you wait it out and graduate from Notre Dame.

Absolutely UNC. Will be a great experience after 3 years in North Dakota and why, why, why would you take on 10k of debt if you don’t have to. Touring doesn’t give a complete picture of your future experience. It will be the people you meet that shape that.
Boston will be a lot more fun later in your life when you have the money to enjoy it.

–You need to understand that investment banking jobs are few and far between for undergrads.  You should expand your horizons in terms of jobs you would be looking for.
–You should look at the core requirements for both schools (can be found online).  Chances are at BC you would have to spend a great deal of time taking classes like theology, philosophy etc.  to complete the Jesuit core.
–I’d consider the schools to be academic peers.   I’d go to UNC and avoid debt – being debt free will give you more options down the road.

Posters who summarily dismiss BC as not even being in the same ‘league’ as UNC (actually they are in the same league – the ACC!) need some comparative facts, and here they are:
USNews rank - UNC-30    BC-31 (last year I believe the positions were reversed)
Forbes rank - UNC-47    BC-22 – but who goes by Forbes?!
Niche rank - UNC-44    BC-80 – ah, this must be the right ranking!
SAT/ACT score range - UNC 1280-1460 and 27-32        BC 1340-1510 and 30-33
Student population - UNC ~ 29,000     BC ~ 14,000
Endowment - UNC ~ 3billion      BC ~ 2billion
Endowment per student - BC&gt;UNC
So, this business of UNC being soooo much better than BC shows merely simple ignorance.
And, by the way, the theology requirement is, I believe, any two courses available from the extensive offerings (intellectually stimulating, thought-provoking subjects – none of which try to ram religion down one’s throat) that are one term each.
And philosophy?! No requirement that I know of, but if philosophy is a turn-off then it raises the question of whether one should be in college at all, as it is perhaps the only time in life where one is exposed to the great thinkers through the ages. Should be required of all students!

I will reiterate my belief that these schools are academic peers. Each has advantages and disadvantages but I think that overall, there is little difference in quality, if any.
You should decide, then, based on fit (social vibe, environment, etc.), cost, and specific job markets/opportunities you are interested in and how well each school does at drawing recruiters.

If you use the term “academic peers” very generally, then yes. However, from those among the know (i.e. academia), UNC is generally seen as a tier above.

BC makes up for its lack of research (…which impacts that academic rep score…) with smaller classes, which means more interaction with profs.
Over half the classes at BC have fewer than 20 students and just 2% of classes have 100 or more.
At UNC, 42% are under 20 and 7% are 100+. That’s pretty good, but BC has the edge.
I take little things like that into account when I call them undergraduate peers.

@prezbucky OP is a junior so will likely have small classes but that could be important for other students. I get the impression that OP is resilient and driven and could thrive regardless.

Absolutely true – both schools probably feature small(ish) upper-level classes.
