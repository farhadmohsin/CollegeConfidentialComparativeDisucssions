Someone asked that question nearly nine years ago and got the following response:
https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/haverford-college/979316-haverford-wharton-school.html
Bottom line: You may be able to take some classes at Wharton, but, you won’t be able to major in business. OTOH, Haverford has a very fine placement record for finance and business, comparable to other highly regarded LACs in the northeast U.S.

Haverford College students have full cross registration with Bryn Maur College across the street, and can swim in the pool at Bryn Mawr College, a woman’s college.     Also Haverford students have cross registration at Swarthmore College and I thought Arts and Sciences classes at U of Pennsylvania.    there is a train directly from Haverford to U of Penn and a bus to get to Swarthmore College.

Congratulations on your acceptances, those are two very good choices. How do the net costs compare for each school? Do you need to finance any of the costs with loans? Would you major in econ at both schools?
Comparing the graduate outcomes is a good idea–here is some 2017 data for Richmond https://careerservices.richmond.edu/post-graduation-data/index.html
Both career centers will give you more details if you contact them.
You might also take a look at the econ and/or business professors and their research focus—what do you find most interesting? Also take a look at the course catalogs to compare curriculums and offerings.
Richmond is more than double the size of Haverford in terms of students, with more of a pre-professional feel. The campus is beautiful and suburban. Haverford is also a nice campus but with more of an urban feel. Good luck!

I have to pop in to say that Haverford does not have an urban feel to my mind (as a BMC alum) – it has a duck pond, nature trails, and the traditional small liberal arts college vibe, all on 200 acres. It is located in Haverford – a wealthy suburb about 20 minutes from Philly, with shops off campus. Towns on the Main Line are about a mile apart, all connected by commuter rail to Philly. The area is considered one of the loveliest suburban areas in Philadelphia, with large homes from the turn of the century.
Haverford is also distinctive because of its Quaker traditions of mutual respect and notions of community, which influence everything from self-scheduled final exams to the tradition of Plenary, when students meet to reaffirm the Honor Code. Students do very well after graduation but it does not have a business program. Haverford and Bryn Mawr students can take up to 2 classes a term at U Penn, though the classes must be classes which are not regularly offered at either Haverford or Bryn Mawr, and Wharton and Engineering classes are excluded.

This may be a case of splitting hairs, but, @Mwfan1921 has a point. Once you step off campus, the surrounding areas  of each college have a tangibly different feel. Delaware County (PA) is nearly four times more densely populated than Henrico County (VA). In fact, compared to Haverford, I’d be tempted to say that Richmond is more rural in feel. But, that, I’m sure, would inspire some pushback from others on this forum. Both are lovely, lovely campuses.

The Richmond scholars get a full ride, plus special programming and class selection. It’s a great deal. But, I don’t know your financial situation.
If you’re really wanting to take some business classes, Richmond’s business school is quite good (and beautiful). They have Bloomberg terminals, a student managed investment fund, and a club that focuses on Wall Street IB placement. This coming year, they are adding a data analytics major. Lots of kids double major, and Richmond has a unique leadership school. The school has a great network.
My guess is that Haverford is more intellectual, Richmond more preprofessional, though you would have your Scholar cohorts.

^Well, just to play devil’s advocate for a moment, I would ask, how the OP feels about being a token intellectual within a somewhat larger campus?

Ask both Haverford and Richmond how many of their international graduates are able to find employers for the OPT that they are entitled to after graduation.  If you don’t find an employer who will hire you for the OPT, you will need to go home almost immediately after you graduate.
And do remember, when you have your interview for your student visa, you need to state clearly and believably that you intend to return to your country after completing your education and your OPT.  If the interviewer thinks that you intend to stay in the US longer than that, you will not get a visa.

@Anna20021988 I have been very fortunate to have 2 Ds who were Richmond Scholars. They both had great experiences at UR, with excellent professors and advising, small challenging classes, lovely campus and weather, not far from downtown Richmond, a fun city with great food, parks, museums and activities. The business school is excellent and students have great outcomes with internships and job opportunities.
One of my Ds studied abroad at St. Andrews University in Scotland, all paid for with her scholarship, with extra funding for travel and educational experiences while abroad. Another excellent program is the Sophomore Scholars in Residence, providing students the opportunity to take a class in a variety of subject areas with an integrated travel component, and the students are housed together for the year while taking the class, as well working on long term projects. The SSIR program is fully funded with no extra costs for students. In addition, UR guarantees a stipend of $4K to fund research or an internship.
A top student will not be a “token intellectual” at UR. 25% of students have a an SAT of 1460+ and/or ACT of 32+. My 2 Ds always felt that there were many other bright students in their classes to challenge each other and have thoughtful discussions.

A little more info about URichmond: UR is not in a rural location(I say this as someone who live 40 miles from Philadelphia who is very familiar with both areas). It is located not too far from the busy Interstate 95 highway corridor. UR’s campus is in the sprawling suburbs of Richmond, about 10 mins. from downtown areas, including the very fun Carytown area, which is popular with students. There is lots of shopping, grocery stores, good access to medical care, etc. in the surrounding areas.
Richmond and its suburbs are certainly smaller and less populous than Philly and its suburbs, but hardly rural. Areas west of Richmond, heading towards the mountains in Shenandoah and the Charlottesville area where UVA is located are much more rural. That area is lovely with lots of farms, vineyards, parks and hiking, scenic views.
Richmond has 2 Amtrak rail stops, 1 downtown and 1 in the suburbs, which many UR students use. Richmond also has an international airport, although not gigantic, and the campus has shuttles available to accommodate student travel for breaks.
UR runs also shuttle buses to several shopping areas as well as to downtown Richmond. Students also use Uber ride sharing to get around, and many students have cars on campus, since parking is plentiful and inexpensive (although a car is not necessary, neither of my UR grads had one).

The University of Richmond as a Richmond Scholar seems to be the wiser & easy choice for one who wants to study business–especially since your stated interest in Haverford College is the chance to study business at Penn-Wharton.

Richmond is 10% international. Amazing food. In fact, an alum who was visiting campus wasn’t happy with his dessert a few years back, so funded an enormous gourmet dessert selection. Richmond has over a 2 billion dollar endowment! Huge for such a small LAC. (Haverford’s is about 500 mill). That’s why Richmond is so generous with funds to travel, research, study abroad, etc.
As for being a token intellectual, my S, not a richmond Scholar, had a 34ACT/1520 Sat, mostly As (until slacking senior yr) in rigorous curriculum (finished AP calc BC in 11th grade and took a discrete math topic 12th, Phys C, all told 8-10 APs (depending on how you count them)), so there are plenty of “smart” kids there. And, the curriculum is rigorous. Our somewhat immature son thought he could get by with the approach he took in senior year high school and learned the hard way (bad 1st sem grades), he needs to really study.
As for law school, have you looked at Richmond’s Philosophy, Politics, Economics and Law major? It’s what drew our S to Richmond. Kids LOVE that major. If you’re a Richmond Scholar, get a 3.8 or above GPA (which might be easier to get at Richmond than Haverford, idk) and take advantage of everything the school offers, you’ll be well set for the LSATs and a top law school.
Look into the first year Endeavors and sophomore scholars in residence programs. They are excellent. And with Endeavors, you’ll be coming to school a little early and living with like-minded individuals.

Only very very religious/conservative college students would have a problem with gay rights or actually LGBTQ rights. It would not be the case at Richmond.
As for science, they have Pollutants in the environment, Chemistry detectives, biochemistry in the real world, chemistry of cooking, chemistry in art, marine biology in the bay, astronomy… Lots to choose from (in addition to the traditional first year courses and the more advanced classes).
Finally, they offer a corporate finance track AND a very strong creative writing minor.

Not sure how Haverford is different - Haverford offers one or two “non major” classes per science Dept. Per semester (Perspectives in Biology, Astronomical ideas…) The offerings seem actually broader at Richmond.

@Anna20021988 You seem to be all over the place. It’s difficult to get a sense of what you want.

You say you want to study finance. Haverford doesn't offer finance. 
You say you want to also study creative writing/English/history. Both colleges offer that and you can study both finance and creative writing at Richmond.
You say you don't like science but seem concerned about the number of science courses offered by each college.
Both schools offer a myriad of natural science electives.
Both colleges offer a study abroad program at the London School of Economics. 

I don’t have a horse in this race so I’m not trying to persuade you one way or the other. It took me just a few minutes to search for these answers on each college’s respective websites. My sense is that you are looking for reasons not to go to Richmond.
You’ve received some detailed responses from other posters so I hope that you can feel good about which college you ultimately decide to attend. Good luck!

One possible negative about Haverford. Its is very dominated by women, because Bryn Mawr is a women’s college and Haverford is about 52% or a little more,  women.  Since students mix freely between the two adjacent LACs, there is a definite dominance of women and less men to date if that matters to you.
The gender imbalance at Haverford/Bryn Mawr and the very small size makes socializing a bit more confined than a larger school like Richmond.
Haverford student body  is focused on  a very strong honor code. This means tests are not proctored.
Here is some ongoing discussion of this honor code.  The writers here look to be excellent !

Richmond would be a larger student body with more students who may be preprofessionally focused.
Haverford is the more intellectual/liberal tight knit liberal arts campus.
Haverford seems somewhat sporty to me, especially the girls.

I’m not going to comment on URichmond, which I think is a great college.  I’m just going to comment on Haverford because I know much more about it than Richmond.  It’s not dominated by women.  Yes classes are shared in the consortium, and yes, most social events are open to both Haverford and BMC students, but honestly most of the BMC students are not spending tons of time at Haverford.  They chose BMC for a reason.
Second, yes you can take Penn classes, and many students do.  It’s not hard to get to Penn from Haverford.  But I don’t think going to Haverford just so you can take a few classes at Penn is a good reason to choose the college.  Students at Haverford want to be at Haverford, not Penn.  The culture is very different from the one at Penn, so perhaps if you love the Wharton vibe Haverford isn’t a match.
Haverford is filled with students who lean to the quirky/intellectual side.  It’s does not have the pre-professional vibe that Penn does.  It’s not very sporty, despite the fact that many students are on athletic teams.  It’s just another thing they might do on the side, not close to the most important thing they do.
I think you are looking at 2 great colleges and you need to take some time to think about them.  Visit if you can.  And then just go with whichever one fits you best.

Much as I love Haverford (I was a Bryn Mawr grad from before Haverford was co-ed), I would not choose it primarily because it affords the chance to take classes at other schools, including Penn. Haverford is a small, distinctive community based on Quaker traditions of community and tolerance. While Haverford and Bryn Mawr students can take classes at Penn, that only applies to Arts and Sciences type classes – Wharton and Engineering classes are excluded – and is limited to classes which are not generally offered at Haverford and Bryn Mawr. I would discourage selecting Haverford with the idea that it is a “back door” to Penn.
For a student who wants a business major and is not excited by the Haverford culture, Richmond sounds like the better option.

@Anna20021988 Law school acceptance is almost entirely gpa and LSAT scores and most students have to borrow $75,000 a year for 3 years to get through law school, so the general advice – similar to med school – is save money on undergrad to reduce loans and preserve any savings to pay for law school. On that basis, Richmond would be better option.
In terms of access to an exchange program with LSE – exchange programs with Oxford, Cambridge and, presumably, LSE, are usually very competitive for students applying to visit from US schools – the students we know who were admitted to the Oxford study abroad program were the “cream of the crop” at their respective universities. I tend to think that being a big deal scholarship recipient at Richmond would create more opportunities for research, leadership and other skills which would maximize acceptance into a competitive admissions study abroad such as LSE.
You said a tolerant community is important to you – and Haverford certainly meets that. But the other reasons you said you liked Haverford – its location and the opportunity to take classes at Penn (which does NOT include Wharton) does not seem like a strong reason to prefer Haverford.
As I said, I’m a BiCo community member, I think Haverford is an amazing school.

Op, you know that rationally Richmond is better for your purpose but you still prefer Haverford for many reasons, rational or irrational. Sometimes, when you can afford something you really want, you can go for it and not feel guilty.
(The case is different if your parents can’t afford Haverford).

Math at Bryn Maur is better than Haverford and arguably very strong, so don’t overlook what Bryn Maur offers Haverford students, and they can simply walk there, about 1.8 miles, or bus over quickly or ride a bike. .  The swimming pool is over at Bryn Mawr.  I would look much more carefully at Bryn Maur classes rather than Penn, as its more accessible.   The train is not very far to Penn, but more effort.   For a business major, math matters a lot.  The more math you take the more MBA programs or law programs will accept you, but does depend a little on your law or business goals.
