Academics - Wesleyan has a lower student/faculty ratio, but, that's not surprising since it is a private university. You can get a great non-STEM education at either place.
Reputation/Prestige - top graduate schools and employers are aware of both schools.
Location - W&M hands-down, the winner. Nothing quite like being part of a historic Colonial restoration project.
Facilities and resources - Again, I don't think either school has a clear advantage here. Once you step off the mainly historic quads, the facilities get quite modern.
Value of cost - Here's where it gets dicey. You're probably paying OOS tuition for a public university at W&M. For essentially the same amount of money you would be sharing space with three times the number of total students (grad and undergrad) and larger classes than you would at Wesleyan. Also, not to put too fine a point on it - two thirds of your classmates at W&M will be from the same state.
Safety - Crime is a scary thing whenever it happens, especially on a quiet campus. According to Clery Statistics Wesleyan has a big lead in reported rape cases. Some people argue that it is because Wesleyan does a better job at encouraging people to report such occurrences. Either way, it's not a pretty statistic 
Outcome/opportunities (chance to get into top grad schools/career development) - IMO, it depends on what you make of your opportunities (i.e., grades and test scores.)
Food and dorm - Wesleyan has an unusual graduated independent living approach to student housing with hundreds of small houses dotting the campus. I'm guessing W&M has more conventional dorms.
Quality of life - I've heard great things about the level of student satisfaction at both places.
Athletics - Not clear what you are looking for here.

If you are interested in participating in intercollegiate athletics, then this is much more likely at Wesleyan. Wes is a much smaller school, yet sponsors more varsity teams. Furthermore, the bar for athletic talent is relatively low, since Wes is a Division III school. So Wes has lots of athletic participation: about 21.5% of enrolled students are varsity athletes. The rate for W&M is much lower, only about 8.2%.
If you are interested in following intercollegiate athletics as a fan, then W&M is better, because it is a Division I school with serious athletes playing on athletic scholarships. However, the difference may not be great as you might expect. W&M plays football at the D1-FCS level, which is still “minor league” as far as the average college football fan is concerned. W&M is theoretically eligible for the NCAA basketball tournament, but has never actually qualified. So W&M sports, while entertaining, aren’t generally featured prominently on national media, as UVa or Virginia Tech games might be.

Funk

If you are going to compare these two particular schools, you should really be aware of the pronounced differences in funkiness. Wes is generally regarded as a pretty funky place. At W&M, the “historic Colonial restoration project” atmosphere has its charms, but is arguably deficient in terms of bringing the funk.

For a tourist, Williamsburg is definitely a  more interesting place to visit than Middletown, CT.  However, you can tour Williamsburg in about a day, then when the novelty wears off, you’re out in the boondocks 2.5 hours from Washington DC. Middletown is roughly the same distance to NYC, but maybe a little less to Boston and fairly close to many other college campuses. On balance, I think I’d prefer Wesleyan’s location … but not for ~$10K/year more (if location were the only difference that mattered to me).

I think they are roughly comparable schools in reputation, academics.  W&M is over twice as large, public, and is in a different area (Mid-Atlantic vs New England).  If you could visit, you would probably get a sense for which you prefer.  If you cannot, I believe both have reputations for having relatively happy student bodies.

The “funk” is referring to the students at Wesleyan and the type of school it is. Although a great institution with tons of talent, their process and classes, along with many of the people are very “out there” and not in the good way. I have heard too many stories of the social hardships and turning to intense drugs (not sure if you heard of the overdose story of students last year). It’s a tough place to live and the community or Wesleyan doesn’t make it any better. W&M on the other hand has an amazing community, bigger but stronger, and a much better town. Same distances from the major city, same academics (both semi hands on if that’s what you want) and W&M just has a statistically better “college life”. In every respect I would choose W&M over Wesleyan.

@circuitrider So how should I change my thinking process?
[/quote]

You misunderstood me. Your thinking process was fine. It got you from where you started which was with a list of two dozen colleges with virtually nothing in common except that they were all excellent colleges and universities, to where you are today with a tough decision between two excellent American colleges. Your parents must be very proud.
But, I’m curious: What do you do for fun?

What do you mean by funk? Could you elaborate on that? I’m sorry I’m not a native speaker.
[/quote]

W&M is a school that is rooted in history and tradition, going back to the 17th Century. It is so old and full of history – perhaps more than any other US school – that the campus is almost a museum. W&M students tend to embrace this heritage.
Wesleyan, on the other hand, has students that are known for rejecting tradition, and experimenting with new ideas, even ideas that may initially seem crazy. Funky = new, different, crazy; could be either good or bad. Wesleyan is perhaps funkier than another US school.
So these two schools – though both academically strong – have very different “personalities”. W&M is known for heritage and tradition; Wesleyan is known for unconventional thinking and behavior. You wanted info on ten criteria – yet none of your criteria addressed what many people would see as the most obvious and important difference between the two schools.
