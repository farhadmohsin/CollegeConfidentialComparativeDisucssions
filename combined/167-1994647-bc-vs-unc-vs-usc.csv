Congrats all super schools. You must have worked hard for the opportunities.
Did you get into Carroll school?  If so and you want to work on east coast in govt or banking my opinion would be BC. If not it’s a toss up. My daughter got into BC and USC but chose USC for the weather . She also had honors college at UF and full scholarship. UF isn’t UNC but it’s a top 10 USNWR public uni like unc.  It’s pretty close.
She is premed though not business. If she got into Carroll and not the other schools b schools it would be 100 percent BC

Also assuming costs are same or not part of your decision.

UNC–no guaranteed admit to business
USC- On the eest coast–you are interested in working on the East Coast
BC–On the east coast. If you can study business there, what is the downside?

@Vincent1997 I asked so that you can help yourself reach a conclusion.  That BC &lt; UNC CH in business (based only on what you say) won’t matter if you don’t have a guaranteed admit. The admission stats for UNC’s business school are really low, so you are taking a risk.  Do you have a back up major?

Unc is an excellent school. And seems like where you would like to attend.  I’ve been there numerous times and think it’s a very nice place. Know a few grads and they are good kids and gainfully employed. But I have no idea where your stats are comming from regarding BC Carroll School of Management low pay and localized around Boston?  That’s utter nonsense. Sorry. A large group of students stay in Boston because Boston is very attractive and New England despite the weather gets a hold of you. So yeah BC is big in Boston. Which also the educational capital of the world. The mutual fund capital, genetics reasesrch and pharmaceutical. And hot tech.  And low pay. I could give you the list of superstar CSOM grads but that would be unnecessary.
Congrats on all the great options  Best of luck at UNC and enjoy the great hoops too!

@Vincent1997 I think you are still waiting to hear from USC? Is that correct? Did you apply to Marshall? Are the other schools transfer decision’s out yet - have you been accepted into them and need to make a decision on one or the other right away? Point is I think the answer for now is BC or UNC - choose between them, then make it a choice between USC and that winner when the time comes. Comparing two at a time is easier so things don’t get jumbled in your head.

Sorry Vincent I don’t know. She’s a Fall Freshman. But all of the schools you like are world class in every way including facilities. BC facilities keep getting better. Except some forced triples for freshman. The new rec center opening this fall and the new science center for 2019 are awesome. Unc was the same. When went I was more impressed with their campus than duke and that’s rarefied air.

@vincent1997 there are a lot of lovely tucked away areas on the USC campus to get personal space. Of course the Ronald Tutor Center at lunch seems like Times Square in NYC, but once you get off the main paths, you would be surprised by all the lovely fountains and garden areas. I have been there close to 50 times and keep finding new corners of that campus. And the facilities themselves all have wonderful hideaways. The new Marshall//Business building Fertitta Hall is fantastic. The new Village is crazy impressive, so if you get into USC, don’t worry about finding your space there. You have wonderful choices ahead of you. My D didn’t choose UNC CH because with 80% NC students, she feared it would lack the diversity she is use to being in California. Just one perspective of many you can consider.

@Vincent1997 ,S loved both UNC and USC but did not end up applying to UNC for the reason you mentioned (no guarantee of admit to the business school) plus OOS costs would be higher than merit from a private university like USC. He ended up getting merit at USC but chose another school in the end. Part of the reason was that he realized he did not want to commit to living in Southern California after graduation. Also, it was not the strongest fit after he spent a night there during interview weekend. Other schools did a better job with overnight visits. The University Village is impressive on the outside but less conducive to meeting lots of people as compared with a regular dorm, based on the suite arrangements. It’s not that you can’t meet people if you room at the Village. It’s just a little less easy as a dorm such as Birnkrant.
Costs are also very high (from rent to insurance to gas to you name it) in Los Angeles.That would be true of Boston as well. I think you are smart to consider what your ultimate goal is in terms of living and working after four years. Not everyone knows the answer but in your case, you seem to be pretty certain about working on the East Coast. Marshall Business school is strongest in L.A. and Asia. Many on CC are rah rah about the Trojan alumni network but I don’t think it rings true nearly like in Southern Cal. I would go with your instincts and choose either UNC or BC. If you are like my S, you’ll lean towards the school that is offering you a sure admit into the major you would like to study and where you click with the student body. You can take a chance on UNC and getting into the B school. If you don’t get into the business school, you could probably major in econ or something else. Raleigh would have the second best weather of the choices  but BC offers you the direct admit to the business school in the part of the country that you would like to ultimately work.

BC actually does pretty well in Wall St recruiting. I’d call them a semi target. They also do well in the mutual fund business and finance in general. Boston is a major finance center and all of the major IB firms have local offices as well as recruit to NYC. Go on Linkedin and look at the alumni. Also go on Wall St Oasis and search for BC. I think it’s recruited as heavily if not more than UNC.
Both great schools in great places.
Where do you want to live? East coast has many different flavors.

I have a kid getting a business degree this week, & I have become very aware of how huge it is to go to college near where you want to work. Internships, interviews, networking, professors’ influence, knowledge of the job market…EVERYTHING is easier if it isn’t far away.  So going to USC when you know you want to end up on the opposite coast seems really silly.  Especially considering you might have 2 comparable alternatives.
