No honors at McCombs, right?
If American, I would choose Mendoza. McIntire is too uncertain.

There would be a pecking order in terms of opportunities at UT-Austin:
BHP
Then regular McComb + maybe engineering/CS
Then other UT-Austin
And UT-Austin in general would be only a semi-target for MBB like ND. But at ND, Mendoza would be at the top of the pecking order.
If an International, you should look to work outside the US, anyway, even if MBB.
Outside the US, McComb and UVa/McIntire probably have stronger networks, but McIntire is competitive admissions.
McIntire would be the best if you can get in.

FYI, here are MBB targets:

In the US, MBB recruits more at the MBA level than from undergrad, so your son may want to aim for a good job out of undergrad first, then get in to a M7 (or at least top 15) MBA program and try for MBB then.

I’d go with Mendoza. It’s guaranteed and it’s a top school with lots of opportunities. At McCombs the regular student comes after the BHP students and McIntyre is too risky.

Stern is more targeted for IB/finance.  For MBB straight out of undergrad, probably about as good as the rest (so not great). Risk of what?  You should accept an offer elsewhere before 8/1.

He can try to transfer in.  But he may not want to leave ND after 2 years.  ND has a very strong alumni network (in the US) and community.

I doubt he’ll want to transfer from Mendoza (which is as strong as McIntyre in the us)
. He needs to deposit somewhere by may 1st and then can accept any wait-list. Odds of getting off the wait-list are very low.

Because your son wants to study business, his only real options are Notre Dame & Texas. Then it becomes a personal choice as they offer significantly different campus cultures.
For the top three consulting firms, probably need 3 years work experience & then an MBA from a very top ranked MBA school (think M-7 or in that range).

The issue is that it’s not ""will’ but “may”. It’s a lot of risk when you have two Business choices, one nationally known (Mendoza) and one excellent (McCombs, althought BHP has the upper hand over McCombs regular).

@MYOS1634, well, there is no “pre-business” at UVa so no one knows how many wanted McIntire as freshmen.
Here are the UVa admissions stats: https://www.commerce.virginia.edu/undergrad/application-process-uva
And McIntire for transfers (where they openly say they are biased towards VA CC applicants):

ND is money is not an issue. Based on m But depending on your colture and religious preferences it could be UT which will be a bit more diverse. Brother in law is a Nd grad and found it good for him as a quiet kid. Buddy at work son last year chose uva over Nd because he thought it was all very homogeneous   And they flew him out as a very recruited student small sample size.  But it’s all I have.

@Winruss   Sorry he was a Wendy’s all American scholar winner etc. UVA Jefferson scholar finalist and highly sought after academic student   He was saying no to ND and they asked if they could fly him out for a separate visit
I can only tell you he chose UVA although he didn’t win the Jefferson. He thought ND was a special place and kids really smart but a bit homogeneous.  He has loved uva and will be honored by living on the Lawn for senior year.
As I said brother in law who is successful attorney loved ND and it’s network has served him well. He is very proud to be a ND grad
Bottom line is you can be super successful anywhere and these top schools offer unlimited opportunity.  Comparisons are interesting but not really super indicative
