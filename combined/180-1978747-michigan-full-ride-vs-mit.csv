Not crazy. If you are smart enough to land a full ride you UM, you will be very successful there. You will have a research and internship opportunities and do well no matter where you go.

Not crazy at all. In 40 years, given conservative real returns of 5% a year, that would be about $2M in today’s dollars. That’s enough for retirement just by itself. And yeah, if MIT means taking a chunk out of parents’ retirement, then it is a no-brainer.
And at a place like UMich with it’s plethora of highly-rated departments and grad programs, you can make your education as rigorous as you desire. Just start taking grad school classes if undergrad-level classes aren’t challenging enough.

Another way to look at it:
If you do as well in undergrad at UMich as in HS, a master’s at MIT/Stanford is well within the range of possibility, and while you get roughly the same opportunities at that point as if you had gone straight to MIT for undergrad, 2 years is a lot less costly than 4 years.

I assume you are thinking of majoring in Engineering. Michigan is one of the top 6 or 7 CoE in the country. 2 of MIT’s last 4 presidents (Jerome Wiesner and Charles Vest) were Michigan alumni. While MIT is indeed slightly better than Michigan, it is not $250k better. Besides, you said you prefer Michigan to MIT socially, and there is much to be said for “fit”. Go to Michigan for college. You can always challenge yourself there and get your PhD or graduate degree from MIT at a later date.

If your parents would have trouble saving for retirement (or college for younger siblings) if they paid for MIT, that suggests taking the full ride.
PhD programs worth attending should be funded, so cost is not a big concern (though some stipends are bigger than others relative to the local cost of living).

This is a no-brainer… go to Michigan.  Fantastic reputation in STEM. Awesome social life. ZERO COST!
I have met many successful Michigan alumni, and Michigan is one of the only schools I know that every single one of their alumni are fanatical with loyalty and praise.

Not crazy. D took a full tuition merit scholarship at Vanderbilt instead of MIT last year. She is doing CS on premed track,which she probably wouldn’t dare to do if she went to MIT due to GPA concerns.
Did you get the Stamps scholarship from U Michigan?? If it is, it is more than a full ride, it is network, leadership opportunities, travel,etc.  Best of luck!

@merc81, I daresay that all full-pay students at MIT would have qualfied for full-ride scholarships from some school.
But UMich is not Alabama St.  I consider UMich to be a Near-Ivy and only a handful of MIT admits would have gotten a full-ride from a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent.
Those are incredibly rare and difficult to get (if you don’t count the all-female schools and military academies).  Between them, Rice, Duke, UChicago, Caltech, Oberlin, UMich (for OOS), and UVa (for OOS) probably offer fewer than 200 full-rides total.

Contrarian here. I’d go to MIT. The resources there are far and away beyond U of Michigan. Yes, you will get an close education. No, the opportunities will not be equal. If you want to raise venture capital for your business idea in 10 years, you will want MIT. Ask someone in the field you plan to go into. Opportunities (networking, capital and other cannot be discounted) Are they worth 250K, that depends. But every MIT student can get into other schools on a free ride. Yet, they chose MIT.  Might not be your choice. But there are reasons.

I don’t think the resources at MIT are “far and away beyond” Michigan, not in a way that would be meaningful to an undergraduate anyway. Perhaps if she were choosing specific doctoral programs, maybe, but as an undergrad I think the resources will be functionally equivalent.
Besides, even if they are a bit better, I don’t think they’re worth $250K plus interest. Particularly if they are an engineering major, as other people here who hire engineers have repeatedly said that engineers don’t get paid more for what college they went to.
If OP is trying to raise venture capital in 10 years I doubt whether they went to MIT or Michigan will be the linchpin in their pitch. It’ll be about their work experience, the networks they’ve built and the idea they have. I work in tech, and I gotta say I know a LOT more Michigan alumni than I know MIT alumni.

This assertion piqued my interest.  What is your background, @Happytimes2001?
@Alexandre attended both UMich and Cornell and stated that he did not see a difference in resources between the two.  Are you thus asserting that the resources at MIT are far and away beyond what is available at Cornell?
And what resources are you referring to?
BTW, when it comes to startup founders, from a Crunchbase spreadsheet I analyzed, yes, MIT and Stanford outpace UMich (though UMich isn’t too shabby, being in the top 10: https://news.crunchbase.com/news/top-schools-among-founders-raise-big-dollars/), but here’s the thing: roughly half or more of those MIT/Stanford alums who were startup founders were grad alums (including PhD’s and MBA’s).  And PhD’s are fully fulled while 2 years of a Master’s/MBA is significantly cheaper than 4 years of undergrad at MIT at full-pay, which is why I said that if the OP excels as much in undergrad as he has in HS, he will still be able to get the opportunities afforded MIT/Stanford alums.

Other people are implying that. With your comment (especially with the follow-up), @merc81, I didn’t get the sense that you necessarily felt that way. But for example, I interpreted Happytimes2001’s comment to mean that a full-ride to a place like Michigan isn’t so special because “anyone at HYPSM could’ve gotten it and turned it down.” Their sentence directly after that seems to imply, to me at least, that the OP should disregard the award for that reason - because MIT is so far and away better than Michigan that the money ceases to matter.
However, I think all that is irrelevant anyway. Let’s assume for a second that every single student at MIT could’ve gotten a full ride to Michigan or an equivalent school and turned it down. So what? What bearing does that have on the OP’s choice? The OP’s choice, IMO, hinges on 1) whether Michigan will provide them with a high-quality education and get them to their career and educational goals - and whether they’ll have the kind of college experience there they are looking for - and 2) whether MIT’s offerings in those areas are worth an extra $250K + interest that they could spend on any number of other things (including, potentially, an MBA or other grad degree from MIT or an equivalent school).
Other undergrads’ decisions about where they wanted to go to college don’t really matter in this case, is my opinion.

Most would not have the opportunity of a full-ride at a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent. Many would have the opportunity of partial scholarships or even full-tuition scholarships from good (above the average flagship) schools or full-rides from average flagships or lower.
And if this is one of those special scholars programs at UMich, don’t discount the opportunities afforded by those either.

Since we don’t know what OP is majoring we can only go by the general reputation of schools and how much it will help in OP’s career.  Years from now employers will only know OP graduated from UM or MIT, not UM with full ride or MIT.  And they will have no idea how selective UM full ride is even if you try to tell them. IMHO, money can always be replaced but college name can never be; once its lost its lost forever.

$280,000 is not easy to replace even for the upper middle and lower upper class (maybe the plutocrat class considers it to be pocket change, though).  If the OP’s parents would have trouble funding their retirement if they spent that on the OP’s college, that should cause the OP to hesitate when there is a good full ride available.

To me, reasons to consider MIT include:

If you would still be a top student at MIT.
If you are heavily interested in Research.
If you are interested in CS/Tech.
If you are the kid who finally gets into a class where you are below the class average for the first time and that makes you happy that you have found your peeps.
If you have amazing focus/attention span.
You want to get involved in as much outside of class as possible.

Because more than a few of us on this thread have attended elite schools for undergrad and/or grad, are friends with or worked with MIT and/or UMich grads, have been on the interviewing end, understand various industries, and in general have a much better grasp as to how much prestige and opportunities at different schools matter in the real world (the hiring world in different industries) than most HS or college kids or lay people.  We also understand how long we have to work to save up $260K after tax and what that type of money really means (roughly $2M by retirement, given conservative return assumptions).  Also, employers will read resumes and know if he got one of those special named scholarships at UMich (he would certainly be free to state that he got the full ride to UMich and note how rare that is on is resume).
As you may have guessed, I actually consider that to be more impressive than a mere HYPSM degree.

Actually, @Much2learn, you actually omitted the most compelling reason to maybe take MIT at full-pay over full-ride at UMich and that is cultural fit.
Even with #4, this kid will find peers among the top students at UMich. This isn’t some average public with only 5%-10% of the student population entering with over a 30 ACT (and almost no one with a &gt;33 ACT).
But if a kid would be miserable at a gigantic sports-crazed B10 school and would love a geeky very STEM-oriented student body, then that’s a strong consideration. In this case, the OP seems to be leaning more towards UMich on the social aspects, however.

As wonderful as MIT’s programs are, UMich not only has very strong programs but their alum network is one of the strongest in the country.  And given how large the school is, the alum network is not only strong but large.  Someone brought up a point about if the OP wants to get a venture funded, s/he would be better off with an MIT background… I’m not sure that’s necessarily true.  It’s highly likely the UMich network would be helpful for funding, not something to be overlooked.
Much of this is a question about how much money a small difference is worth to an individual.  Only OP knows his family’s financial situation, but for most people with a financial situation with less than 9 figures in net worth, $250k is a substantial investment.  Would MIT be “better” for some things if cost were equal?  Sure.  But arguing that the differential is worth $250k is a much tougher sell, especially since the alternative (UMich) is of such high quality.

@1NJParent, Caltech use to offer 2 full-ride merit scholarships a year.  They may have stopped.
Agree that it depends on how much money your parents have.  If they have 8 figures in liquid assets, splurging on MIT isn’t going to hurt much.  But if that $260K is coming out of their retirement savings (as is the case with the OP), then spending that money is crazy when you have such a great alternative at zero cost.

@Purpletitan Based on what I know, I would choose Michigan. I think that 4 years is a long time and that school that is the best social fit is probably the best fit.
I also think that Michigan will be less demanding than MIT, but that may be good, because it can afford the OP with more time to get involved in research, being a TA, participating in coding clubs, adding a minor in math or stats, prepping for interviews, and other valuable bells and whistles.
However, each student is different. For example, if the OP is planning a CS major, top CS students are being offered compensation of over $200k/year directly out of college. In that case, $250k in education costs is a lot, but it is not insurmountable if the student believes that they will thrive better in the MIT environment.

In general, in-state students and students who received hefty scholarships from Michigan will turn down HYPSM if they come from upper middle income and lower higher income families, where their parents’ assets and income are too high to qualify for FA, but too low to justify spending $100k+ more on a college education than Michigan.

Actually, there are some aspects of increased rigor at MIT, though not to the extreme of Caltech or Harvey Mudd.  These include:
a.  First semester calculus (18.01) is basically equivalent to two semesters of calculus at most other schools.
b.  General education requirements are extensive.  Many engineering majors may not like biology, but have to take it at MIT, unlike at other schools.  The humanities, arts, and social studies requirements are heavier than at many other schools.

@Collegethrows124 Depends on your family income and assets. If you guys are truly affluent and 260k is no biggie in the grand scheme of things, then sure go for MIT. If you are regular upper middle class where 260k is a big chunk of money for your family  and would materially impact your family budget, parents retirement plan etc then I d say UMich. Sure MIT has a much stronger name and is the ne plus ultra for engineering but it is not worth all the extra money if it will create issues for your family finances. Especially since Umich is an excellent school with a  top engineering program.

Every family’s definition of wealth is different, so is its willingness to pay dearly for education. In some Asian cultures, many families are willing to pay for education ahead of everything else. So the value proposition of higher education is different for different people.

They are not extreme outliers. I’m surprised that you don’t know that.
For some reason, the top schools are systematically not telling people how much their students are really being compensated. A graduates salary may be $110,000 say, but then there may be a significant $50k+ signing bonus and another $200k+ in equity that accrues over a few years, and other valuable perks on top of that. The schools are only publishing salaries. The total compensation is often very different than the salary.

That is a very rosy view of equity compensation. The big equity jackpots are not the common case for various reasons.
Regarding signing bonuses, those MIT course 6-3 grads found a median signing bonus of $15,000, not $50,000.  Benefits obviously have value, but not $75,000 per year for the usual ones (medical, dental, disability, etc).
Of course, there are plenty of state school CS graduates working in many of the same places for similar pay and benefits as MIT CS graduates.  Maybe less so in IB and MC, but is that the goal here?

In case you haven’t noticed, OP has not responded to any of the suggestions here.  Its very likely none of the advice resonates with his situation. We know very little about OP’s intended majors or family finance, we are not even certain if he was already accepted at both schools.  But a few things were clear: OP’s family is in 250K+ range (that’s MIT full pay threshold) and OP would choose MIT if there were no price differential.
If OP is offered MIT EA and UM full ride he is such a high achiever that he is likely to have a mid career income 300K+ twenty years from now. For a person having a future earning $250k+/yr for 25+ years a $250k difference does not look so big. As @Much2learn suggested people who think MIT new grad being offered more than $200k total compension is out of the norm are probably out of touch with today’s job market. I know a few MIT kids who have received multi-million dollar funding from VCs while still in college.  There are possibilities that MIT undergrad experience may offer but they hardly exist at UM.

I’m a little confused here about why the cost of college has to pay off immediately. Presumably the parents put $250K in a 529 for the purposes of their kid spending it on education. If the OP wants to go to grad school in CS, that would be a fully funded program. No one pays for a CS grad degree at a good university. (Maybe they live cheaply, but that’s OK for 20-somethings.)
Is there some indication in this thread that the parents are hurting for money? The part about the parent’s retirement money seems to be the OP’s misunderstanding that grad school in CS would be something his parents would pay for.

It may not be most, but it is many. I’m sharing a piece of valuable information that I have never discussed on cc: even once. Notice that no one in a position to know is disagreeing with my post? There is a reason for that.
Also, I said I would probably choose Michigan. It’s a great school. My point is that while I think most students should choose Michigan, I can imagine a scenario where MIT could make sense for a particular student on a mission.
@billscho I understand that the signing bonus is one time. In the cases I am familiar with, it does not matter because of the salaries and size of the equity stake, but I allocated it across the vesting period of the equity to get an annual amount.

“If the OP wants to go to grad school in CS, that would be a fully funded program.”
PhD programs worth attending are funded.
Masters programs usually are not. MBA programs may have scholarships but full-rides to top MBA programs are almost non-existent.
As for the 529 money, yes it is budgeted for education, but parents can withdraw an amount equal to the scholarship penalty-free.
As I said, even if that money doesn’t have to be used for the parents’ retirement, after 40 years (when this kid retires), you can expect that amount to be around $2M in today’s dollars.
Yes, fit matters (though it seems like the OP likes UMich more socially anyway), but from an ROI standpoint, this is a no-brainer.

If the OP is studying engineering, the difference is whether the OP will be staying up until 3am or 5am to complete  problem sets. The average ACT is 33/34 vs 34/35.  Both have vast engineering and CS resources. The OP would be paying $280K extra for a sliver of additional rigor. A Ph.D. program is likely to be funded anyway. Better to save the $280K for startup equity.

@aboveaverage, people who hire don’t actually look or care about the minutiae of rankings.
How it works is that they have a list of target schools they recruit at, and then it is up to the individual to impress during interviews. And both UMich and MIT would be a target school for any major software company.
Also, Ann Arbor is near Detroit in the sense that Princeton is near Philly.

FWIW, there are plenty of young people out there who are quite successful without having attended HYPMS. They may even work or attend grad school right alongside MIT grads with their lowly state school degree (of which UM does not even qualify since it is a powerhouse U.)  MIT grads aren’t like people on TV commercials walking around with a golden glow bc of their UG degree.     And the MIT degree does not guarantee automatic business success or grad school admissions.  The person behind the degree matters, and a student who qualified as a Stamps Scholar has demonstrated significant accomplishments already.

I hope the OP of this thread is in dialogue with his parents, not his peers, and that they ignore everything except what is best for their personal situation.

I wouldn’t pay $260k extra just for the prestige or the hope that you might earn more when you graduate. The most important ingredients in success are the people. MIT does offer on average higher quality faculty (and better access to the faculty) and a stronger student peer group than UMich, but the ultimate ingredient is you. How much do you need the advice and directions of the faculty and the pressure from your peer group to motivate yourself? If you don’t, don’t waste the money. Another factor to consider is whether you’ll be in the top quartile at MIT (presumably you’ll be in that quartile at UMich). If you’re not, you won’t likely have much better opportunities.

Take the Michigan scholarship & save the $260,000 if you did in fact get a “full ride” to Michigan (as opposed to a “full tuition” scholarship).
After graduation, if you get a job in Silicon Valley, then you can use the saved $260,000 to make a small down payment on a 400 square foot efficiency condo.

I  haven’t read this entire thread, but I want to remind OP and everyone, that the alternative to Michigan is taking some money from parents’ retirement.  I personally think this is a ridiculous thing to do.  Your parents might be willing to offer it to you, but parents are willing to do all kinds of self-destructive things for their children.  At some point, it is up to the kids to look out for their parents.   You have nearly enough money saved in college savings account to pay for MIT.  If you choose it over the full ride, you should commit to providing the rest on your own and not further burdening your parents.  They have already done their part.  They saved up an enormous sum for your education.  Be grateful and give them a break.

""if the equity compensation was in restricted stock units that vest over time, then it seems unlikely that an already-publicly-traded company would offer $200,000 of such to an entry-level employee for the first job out of (any) college, ""
The student received 5 offers, all from the usual suspects including 3 of the big 5. 2 of the student’s offers (including one from a big 5) included equity of that magnitude.

Yes, this student is exceptional, but there are many exceptional students. This student lacks that one big thing you can point at, so no Olympic medal or Rhodes Scholarship, for example.
Is the outcome college dependent? I don’t know. Every talented kid is a bit different. What they need to thrive is different. We never really know about the road not taken.
Again, I would choose Michigan based on the information presented. It is a great school. My point is simply that for certain particular exceptional students, who see MIT as a better fit, I can imagine a situation where MIT could be worth it if it.

That’s a no-brainer.  Go to Michigan!  A bachelors is still a bachelors whether it’s MIT or Michigan.  If you check professional job listings, you’ll see that there is no distinction between schools, in fact the bachelors is just a minimum requirement.  Experience is where the money and career grows.  If you go for the scholarship at Michigan, you could still use part of that money for a master’s degree, which would squash an MIT bachelors any day of the week.

The excerpt below is from Quora re: MIT vs topknotch public schools that are highly regarded for STEM. Nonetheless, I’d probably still go with the full ride from Michigan and MIT for grad school.
""The biggest issues that I might consider in the public vs private (school) analysis would be class sizes, professor-student interaction, and availability of opportunities outside of the classroom. This would include access to professors beyond posted office hours, availability of special programs, access to research opportunities, unique study abroad programs, funding for special programs/personal student projects/student clubs.
Then try to evaluate how much you would take advantage of these special programs at the more expensive school — how “necessary” vs “that would be kind of nice but no big deal” are they to you? Frankly if Baskins Robbins ice cream parlor offers 31 flavors but all you ever order is chocolate — then what difference do the rest of those 30 flavors make to you? They could be the most exotic flavors on the planet, but if all you ever order is chocolate, then so what?
MIT’s price tag includes this overwhelming multitude of opportunities — but if all you want is to take a basic set of CS classes (that nearly every good university offers) and get your degree as quickly and expediently as you can — well, why pay for the extras that you’re never going to use? MIT is the ultra deluxe education package deal. Is that what you and your parents want, can afford (preferably without going into debt), and are willing to pay for — because you’re really going to take advantage of all of these incredible opportunities?
Okay, so what are some of these extras?
For a kid who likes small instead of big, there are freshman learning communities of only 50 freshman and class sizes between 8 - 12 frosh, turning MIT into a STEM version of a LAC.; MISTI (internships all over the world, all expenses paid); IAP (a ton of fun, enriching, and/or educational things to do during the January term); externships (1 month internships during Jan term sponsored by MIT alumni); wanna do research with a professor? Word on the street is that it usually only takes on average 3 emails to snag one!; UROP (undergraduate research program); Super UROP (an extended and beefed up version of UROP); I don’t know the dollar amount but pretty generous funding for the robotics clubs (I’m guessing on the order of maybe $50,000?, but I really don’t know so don’t quote me on this one); ability to test out of required classes; personal one-on-one meetings with your advisor prior to registration every single semester; both general advisors for freshman who haven’t declared yet and major-specific advisors later on; rarely a problem getting classes in your major (although ironically you might have trouble getting less essential classes like PE, glass blowing and toy design); no problems graduating in 4 years (or at least not due to impacted majors anyway); able to take upper division classes and grad classes at will, even as a freshman; prerequisites that are “guidelines” not requirements; athletic coaches that get the fact that your course load is hard and that you’re at MIT to be a student first and an athlete second; a ton of extracurriculars and clubs (although I suspect that most public schools also have this), M.Eng. program (get your Masters in Engineering in only 1 extra year instead of 2, offered only to MIT undergrads), taking classes with professors who wrote (or are writing anew) the textbook; phenomenal, out-of-this-world research going on in the labs; tons of support (free tutoring, mental health counseling, etc.); funding for dorm activities, outings, trips to help dorm bonding; a resident professor living in every dorm and a grad stud on every floor; and, last but by no means least, the amazingness of your fellow classmates, roommates, frat mates. I could go on and on….but my hand is tired of keyboarding now. Hopefully you get the picture.
Sorry for the novel. TL,DR — It’s MIT, welcome to the firehose, baby!""

MIT’s price tag includes this overwhelming multitude of opportunities — but if all you want is to take a basic set of CS classes (that nearly every good university offers) and get your degree as quickly and expediently as you can — well, why pay for the extras that you’re never going to use? MIT is the ultra deluxe education package deal. Is that what you and your parents want, can afford (preferably without going into debt), and are willing to pay for — because you’re really going to take advantage of all of these incredible opportunities?
Okay, so what are some of these extras?
For a kid who likes small instead of big, there are freshman learning communities of only 50 freshman and class sizes between 8 - 12 frosh, turning MIT into a STEM version of a LAC.; MISTI (internships all over the world, all expenses paid); IAP (a ton of fun, enriching, and/or educational things to do during the January term); externships (1 month internships during Jan term sponsored by MIT alumni); wanna do research with a professor? Word on the street is that it usually only takes on average 3 emails to snag one!; UROP (undergraduate research program); Super UROP (an extended and beefed up version of UROP); I don’t know the dollar amount but pretty generous funding for the robotics clubs (I’m guessing on the order of maybe $50,000?, but I really don’t know so don’t quote me on this one); ability to test out of required classes; personal one-on-one meetings with your advisor prior to registration every single semester; both general advisors for freshman who haven’t declared yet and major-specific advisors later on; rarely a problem getting classes in your major (although ironically you might have trouble getting less essential classes like PE, glass blowing and toy design); no problems graduating in 4 years (or at least not due to impacted majors anyway); able to take upper division classes and grad classes at will, even as a freshman; prerequisites that are “guidelines” not requirements; athletic coaches that get the fact that your course load is hard and that you’re at MIT to be a student first and an athlete second; a ton of extracurriculars and clubs (although I suspect that most public schools also have this), M.Eng. program (get your Masters in Engineering in only 1 extra year instead of 2, offered only to MIT undergrads), taking classes with professors who wrote (or are writing anew) the textbook; phenomenal, out-of-this-world research going on in the labs; tons of support (free tutoring, mental health counseling, etc.); funding for dorm activities, outings, trips to help dorm bonding; a resident professor living in every dorm and a grad stud on every floor; and, last but by no means least, the amazingness of your fellow classmates, roommates, frat mates. I could go on and on….but my hand is tired of keyboarding now. Hopefully you get the picture.
Sorry for the novel. TL,DR — It’s MIT, welcome to the firehose, baby!""

The excerpt below is from Quora re: MIT vs topknotch public schools that are highly regarded for STEM. Nonetheless, I’d probably still go with the full ride from Michigan and MIT for grad school.
""The biggest issues that I might consider in the public vs private (school) analysis would be class sizes, professor-student interaction, and availability of opportunities outside of the classroom. This would include access to professors beyond posted office hours, availability of special programs, access to research opportunities, unique study abroad programs, funding for special programs/personal student projects/student clubs.
Then try to evaluate how much you would take advantage of these special programs at the more expensive school — how “necessary” vs “that would be kind of nice but no big deal” are they to you?

If your parents are very wealthy, go to MIT but if your parents saved up your college fund through hard work and are not very wealthy, be a good son and go to MIchigan.
