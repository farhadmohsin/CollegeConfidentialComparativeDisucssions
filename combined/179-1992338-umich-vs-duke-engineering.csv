I agree - ranking just does not make nearly as much of a difference in other engineering fields.  For most engineering disciplines, any school in the top 10ish will be recruited comparably for jobs in their field right out of undergrad.  BMEs feel the difference, however.  Some of my best friends are BMEs (I know people at Johns Hopkins [#2 BME], Michigan [#9 BME], and Rutgers [#? BME]), and they and can attest to that.

@Humblest my sons path is similar. Engineering leading to business management. He is taking industrial engineering since its more business focus with a business minor. He and 3 friends started a tech club and won 2 grants one for $5,000 and 1for $10,000. He is coming back next week for a week capstone https://lsa.umich.edu/bli/bli-fellows/capstone-experience11
They already won https://www.optimizemi.org/#turn-ideas-into-impact.
All of this has lead to a university of Michigan alumni reaching out to them to be part of this fast growing sector. He was put on an advisory panel for one of the largest seed companies in the start up world. Again through Michigan alumni.
He is just ending his freshman year.
Someone said it Nicely. At Michigan you can be whatever you want to be.
Good Luck.

@Humblest… Alumni started reaching out to them the second they were a registered group is very real. Even y-combinator reached out through another alumni. He is on their student advisory board. Look up what they do. They are a 50 billion dollar company that started, reddit, Uber, airbnb, drop box, stripe etc etc.
Again, if you want things to happen then they will. Michigan is willing to give the resources. There are also ann arbor meet ups on various topics. These are student and company based and small groups.
They were shocked their wasn’t this type of tech group so they just started their own. University was 100% behind them and professors willing and excited to help. The old “make it and they will come” philosophy… Lol.

You should post this on the engineering forum and don’t leave out that you were accepted to Georgia Tech and that it is quite a bit cheaper. You will get the perspective of engineers who have and do hire, not simply the perspective of people defending their pet institutions.

In silicon valley where I know a lot of hiring managers, Michigan has a significant advantage over Duke, but to be fair that includes hiring Comp Sci majors where UM has a better reputation and alumni network than Duke.  I have hired more on the product mgmt/marketing side, not core engineering or software development, and the hiring managers/recruiters for engineering would prioritize Michigan, GT, Duke of the three you’re considering.

You can indeed post this question in the engineering forum, and if you want valid opinions of practicing and hiring engineers, you absolutely should.

I firmly believe that the university matters much more than the major at the undergraduate level. It is also worth noting that several elite private schools have engineering programs that are ranked poorly because they are relatively small. The rankings don’t always measure the quality of research output. They often look at the quantity.
You can bet your bottom dollar that I’d go to Harvard’s SEAS over Georgia Tech or Michigan even though those programs are ranked far higher. If you want to get a sense of the quality of some of Duke’s engineering professors, you should check out these links:

http://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/new-faculty-vahid-tarokh
Also, be extremely skeptical of people who make blanket assertions without citing their sources.

Duke at 8. Michigan at 9.

32 VC investment partners with Duke undergrad degrees. 26 from Michigan (a school that is 5 times larger).

I seriously doubt any hiring engineer would choose Harvard over Georgia Tech or Michigan for an engineering job if that was the only thing that differentiated the candidates. VC, sure, but VC isn’t engineering, it’s business. Ditto investment banking. Having a technical background can help in those fields, but the work is COMPLETELY different. You can find any amount of self affirming data you want, if that’s what you want, or you can simply ask the people who do the hiring. They hang out in the engineering forum.
We might be able to summon some up if you don’t want to move your post… @boneh3ad, @nordicdad, @ClassicRockerDad, @HPuck35, @cosmicfish, @ucbalumnus, @colorado_mom, @MaineLonghorn, @Gator88NE

These 2 quotes are simply wrong.
There is plenty of info out there about people who do MBAs, paid for at huge expense by their firms, who end up leaving in frustration b/c they are not promoted and/or their new skills are not utilized by their company. It is why more than a few large companies now have internal, company-specific talent development programs- so that they don’t pay for a qualification that can easily walk out the door. Similarly, people returning from international assignments often find it hard to fit back in, and use their new skillsets and perspectives, leading to a lot of attrition there as well- not to mention the ones who are (gently or not) encouraged out the door b/c there is no longer a good place for them.
Further, once you are “established in mid/upper-management”, the name of your undergrad institution is simply not a big deal- and it is certainly not “critical”.  What will matter much, much more is your experience and (if you have one) your grad degree.
My bona fides for these opinions: BA/MBA/PhD; taught both business & engineering at the university level; experience working for Fortune 500 companies; consultant at one of the big 4 consulting firms.

Rankings are based on surveys…take them with a grain of salt. No one really knows much about more than 1 or 2 school’s undergraduate programs.
Obviously, elite privates have advantages over public universities, must have to do with resources (student to faculty ratios, etc.).
However, if you’re looking to which gives you an advantage to moving from an engineer, to a senior engineer, to an engineer manager to a technical director and up, there really is no advantage between a Duke and a Michigan degree.
Engineering is a meritocracy. Senior managers and directors will want to promote the best engineers. Most of these engineering managers/directors came from public universities, so they are not biased against them. What’s important (in your first year) is talent, work ethic, and social skills. After a few years, experience then also becomes important (an engineering manager is expected to develop their team). If you exhibit these qualities, you will be placed on the leadership track.
Of course, graduates from elite schools, are more likely to exhibit these qualities, that’s how they got into those schools in the first place! However, it’s not the school that got them selected for a leadership track, it’s their performance on the job.
Now, if you want to earn a BS in engineering, but then jump into consulting, law school, etc, that’s a different conversation.

On engineers getting into management positions. Typically it’s the engineer=engineer manager=engineer directer=VP, etc route. Of course, it’s possible to jump ship and switch from engineering, into sales/marketing/project management/etc and then to a director/executive position in those areas. You don’t have to stay in engineering your whole career, the qualities that made you a good engineer, often translates into other fields, and it’s not uncommon for engineers to make those type of career changes.

@momofsenior1, most council against that now days. It shows a job candidate isn’t interested in ultimately being an engineer, and thus is an impediment to getting a first job. No company of note will put an inexperienced engineer in a managerial position, no matter how prestigious the MBA. A blended 5 year technical BS/MS on the other hand is quite valuable. No more so than any other MS, but it gets the candidate there quicker.

Here’s a more recent Business Insider list, if that resonates. It’s 2017, and top school represented in Silicon Valley. Duke is not on the list, and several schools you’ve eliminated are ahead of Michigan.
Hiring does tend to be regional though. That’s why there’s the high representation of CA publics.
Also note this does not qualify what job, so it will be a conglomerate of SEs, CSs, and various engineers.

Very much enjoying this thread–particularly the funny sports-related side notes!  Now I’m going to say something absolutely profound to the OP.  So amazing, many posters may need to hide their eyes:
OP is going to do extremely well, no matter which world class university is chosen.  As cost is evidently not a concern (an extremely fortunate position to be in that does not apply to most students), I’m going to recommend OP go with the best fit, and also, Go Blue!

“Nevertheless, considering that everything you write places UMich and Duke together, or gives the edge to UMich, makes me skeptical of the accuracy of such information.”
Humblest, I do not give Michigan the edge over Duke in any way except in engineering, where Michigan is in fact better (with the exception of BME, where Duke is better than Michigan). Both universities are very well rounded, but Michigan just happens to be more well-rounded academically (top undergraduate programs in Architecture, Business, Music, Nursing etc…). In Duke’s favor, it is indeed more selective, and its endowment per student is larger. In all cases, the relative advantage that these universities have over each other are negligible. They are both equally exceptional.
“4. Duke has a lower acceptance rate, but the quality of the student bodies is similar”
Is there any evidence, other than personal experience, for such claim given that it is used to refute a number?""
Sadly, no. I can only speak from experience. In-state students at Michigan have lower tests scores than OOS students, but in the classroom, they perform just as well. The in-state students I knew, and I confess to have only know a few dozen, never prepared for standardized tests. This was strange to me because like most OOS students, I worked hard on my SAT preparation. That is why I said that there is a fundamental difference in paradigm to consider when comparing test scores at public universities and private universities. As it is, I am not sure if anybody can differentiate between a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA and an average SAT/ACT of 1410/31.5 and a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA having taken similar classes, and an average SAT/ACT of 1480/33. But when you factor in the effort, or lack thereof, that in-state students at top public universities put into their standardized test preparation, the gap in test scores is likely even smaller.

A students performance in their high school is a far better indicator of success than their SAT/ACT scores.  I could have taken the SAT 4 more times and I likely would have gotten it over the 1500 mark vs. my 1470, it was a matter of answering 2 more questions right!!  So I am one student who will bring down Michigan’s average over a Duke.  But, I have a 3.9 weighted GPA in the most rigorous courses at an “elite” private school in the northeast.
I have friends who got into Duke, Northwestern,Vanderbilt with higher test scores, but easier classes but some of those same friends were rejected from Michigan.  I think just maybe Michigan looks a bit deeper into what kind of student they accept.  Their Common Data Set puts Rigor and School performance above test scores.
Go to Michigan, it truly has more to offer overall and for those who are so driven by rankings it IS ranked better for Engineering.

Michigan hasn’t released their acceptance rate for the Class of 2022, but for the Class of 2021 it was 26.5%. Not 29%.

Those rankings are based on flawed data presented by private universities, including Duke. Duke lists its student to faculty ratio as 6:1. It is in fact 11:1 Those are the types of exaggerations that give private universities the edge in the rankings. If public universities played the same game (sadly, they cannot since their data is audited by the state), they too would be ranked much higher.
But among the educated, Michigan and Duke are peers. That is certainly the opinion of academe, which generally assigns identical undergraduate education ratings to Michigan and Duke. Also, the OP is interested in Engineering, and in Engineering, it is Michigan that is usually ranked higher than Duke.
“US. News ranks Duke # 11 in counselors rank Vs Mich at #22 and over all Duk #9 Vs Michigan #28”
You mention high school counselors  but not university presidents and provosts. Why is that?   According to university presidents and provosts, Michigan and Duke are tied at #13. This actually supports my point above, that Michigan and Duke are considered peer institutions among the highly educated.
""The Duke name cariës more cache in the finance space buy a Wide margin. I base this on thirty years of experience. Duke kids are nethodically recruited by NY IB shops and benefit from the depth and breath of there alumni network.

The OP has not indicated an interest in Wall Street. As an engineer, I assume he is more concerned with Silicon Valley and tech industry jobs. If that is the case, Duke does not present an advantage over Michigan, and I certainly don’t see why the opinion of Investment Banks should be a factor in the OP’s decision.
That being said, I am surprised that Michigan was not a target at any of the major banks that you have worked for. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hired 35 undergraduate students from Ross alone last year. They also took 40 interns from Ross. Other major IBanks like BoA, Blackstone, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche, Lazard, Paribas, UBS etc…all hired Ross students as well. IBanks also recruit graduates from the CoE (Goldman Sachs hired 16 CoE graduates last year alone) and LSA, but obviously focus most of their attention on Ross. Clearly, Ross is a target, whether you care to admit it or not.

Those rankings are based on flawed data presented by private universities, including Duke. Duke lists its student to faculty ratio as 6:1. It is in fact 11:1 Those are the types of exaggerations that give private universities the edge in the rankings. If public universities played the same game (sadly, they cannot since their data is audited by the state), they too would be ranked much higher.
But among the educated, Michigan and Duke are peers. That is certainly the opinion of academe, which generally assigns identical undergraduate education ratings to Michigan and Duke. Also, the OP is interested in Engineering, and in Engineering, it is Michigan that is usually ranked higher than Duke.
“US. News ranks Duke # 11 in counselors rank Vs Mich at #22 and over all Duk #9 Vs Michigan #28”
You mention high school counselors  but not university presidents and provosts. Why is that?   According to university presidents and provosts, Michigan and Duke are tied at #13. This actually supports my point above, that Michigan and Duke are considered peer institutions among the highly educated.
""The Duke name cariës more cache in the finance space buy a Wide margin. I base this on thirty years of experience. Duke kids are nethodically recruited by NY IB shops and benefit from the depth and breath of there alumni network.
Michigan has not been a target of any of the three major banks i have worked For. Occasionaly a resumé would Pass my desk but limited if any true support.""
The OP has not indicated an interest in Wall Street. As an engineer, I assume he is more concerned with Silicon Valley and tech industry jobs. If that is the case, Duke does not present an advantage over Michigan, and I certainly don’t see why the opinion of Investment Banks should be a factor in the OP’s decision.
That being said, I am surprised that Michigan was not a target at any of the major banks that you have worked for. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hired 35 undergraduate students from Ross alone last year. They also took 40 interns from Ross. Other major IBanks like BoA, Blackstone, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche, Lazard, Paribas, UBS etc…all hired Ross students as well. IBanks also recruit graduates from the CoE (Goldman Sachs hired 16 CoE graduates last year alone) and LSA, but obviously focus most of their attention on Ross. Clearly, Ross is a target, whether you care to admit it or not.

“Duke has a better reputation, is harder to get into and is more heavily recruited from.”
Duke is harder to get into, but it does not have a better reputation where it matters, and it is not more heavily recruited.
“Saying otherwise is purely an attempt to minimize a well defined hierarchical difference.”

“Avg GPA U Mich 3.82 Avg ACT 29-32 acceptance rate 29%

Weighted GPA for Duke, unweighted GPA for Michigan. The highest GPA on Michigan’s scale is 4.0. And Michigan’s current acceptance rate roughy 20% and plummeting), not 29%. Also, the mid 50% ACT range for the latest class was 31-35 for Duke and 30-33 for Michigan.

We can go back and forth but the practical reality is the vast majority of students accepted at both schools choose Duke unless driven to U Michigan be a financial imperative.  The same could be said for students decision criteria in choosing Princeton over Duke.
While wishful to think otherwise there does exist a pecking order driven by supply and demand.  In this case consumers (students) choose Duke by a vast majority.  Again both great schools but “speechless” when being told Duke is more sought after or desirable then U Michigan… I believe willfull blindness is the correct term.

OP - did you do an engineering tour at Michigan?  When I took my son there, he had to practically scrape his jaw off off of the floor. The facilities there are so impressive.  I have not toured the engineering facilities at Duke, but I can’t imagine that they can compare to Michigan’s, especially in ME.  My son was ready to dive right in during the tour of the project team facility.  I know that you said you are using engineering as a means to an end, but since you will be doing it for 4 years, you should consider what kinds of opportunities there are for exploration during your UG years. You might actually like engineering and want to actually do it for a while.

Does this report make Michigan one blip better then Duke? The sad fact (with everyone’s facts) is the op was asking about engineering. I am sure he /she is running for cover or left this thread so everyone can compare that their bike is shiner then yours… I wish this thread would end but Feel compelled to state the obvious, Duke is a small Elite Private school that can take the cream of the crop applicants. I don’t think they are taking lower Stat kids like public schools do in general. For engineering their program is very limited. I didn’t even know they had a program but just went on their website. But if I wanted one of the programs they offered I am sure it’s excellent. It’s Duke… They don’t have bad programs.
As stated in my previous posts the opportunities at Michigan are ENDLESS. To the Op, Please pm me if you want more information. My son is going into engineering to get into finance /business management. He really likes the way engineering is taught and makes you think at a different level. Again as stated, he is going back to Michigan tomorrow to do a week long leadership Capstone for their $10,000 grant. They will work with mentors also over the summer to come up with a business plan going forward. It's the first time they took a freshman group and Michigan is paying for an airbnb for the 3 of them for the week to be there....... This is how Michigan supports their students endeavors!
For those spitting out facts please read my two previous remarks in this thread. This is just one example of reality at Michigan that doesn’t show up in the useless stats that are being stated. If you have the initiative and drive you will be successful at either institution.

There is no doubt that high school kids prefer Duke to Michigan. That is not in question. Like I said, with private universities exaggerating the benefits of attendance, such as halving their student to faculty ratios to improve their ranking, it is no wonder that impressionable high schoolers prefer Duke. Employers and academe (aka, graduate school admissions), on the other hand, are not impressionable. To them, Duke and Michigan are peer institutions.

The fact most kids may choose Duke is because of their parents, perceived status elevation versus peers and myths about quality of education versus a world clsss school like Michigan. It’s awfully good marketing to keep the checks coming. And it I think it also a bit of defending ones school, their kids or spouses school or validating choices made in life
Duke offers a phenomenal experience. Cameron indoor is once in a lifetime great. Tenting  to get tickets for unc game is a great tradition. My nephew did the whole month this year. Alumni network is fantastic and rep is first tier.  But um and Ross offer many of the same things and at a price point for many that makes it a clear winner. Pragmatism and real life sacrifices are bandied about in CC with careless abandon. Caveat emptor.

@Alexandre I agree with the basis of what you are saying. I think a lot of this is regional.

My kid went to the number school in our state that feeds Northwestern, University of Chicago and of course Illinois/Champaign. Duke might have a few applications with acceptances but again not for engineering. I am sure more East coast /west are applying to Duke.

Private banker would you agree that if students prefer Duke then ultimately Duke would have the higher performing student body?  If so isn’t it informed thought to attend the school with the stronger students.
Pejorative passive aggressive comments aside. Assuming you are in finance you know independent thought is only of value if the market ultimately arrives at your point of view.  Otherwise you may in fact own and undervalued asset forever never realizing the imbedded value your “independent thought” recognized.
In terms of college you can go to a college you think is better but if you are surrounded by students who went there as a second choice and or the reputation is inferior aren’t you doing yourself a disservice?

For engineering a lot of people at Duke are there because they couldn’t get into their first choice, namely Stanford, MIT, CMU, Princeton, Cornell, Harvey Mudd, even public universities like Berkeley, Georgia Tech and Michigan.
And because Duke uses ED, it’s yield is artificially higher than colleges that use EA like Michigan.  Duke’s RD yield is 37%, Michigan’s is 31%, meaning the colleges are a lot closer in selectivity.

So the anecdotal evidence of UM fans saying the majority of kids choose Duke is false.  The universally observed rankings are wrong.  The acceptance rates that are published are wrong.  The average GPA and Test scores published are wrong.  Lastly I suspect the weather channel is wrong when they suggest NC weather is nicer than Michigan.
Got it.  Duke is everyone’s second or third choice while U Michigan is universally better and top pick  in spite of all evidence to the contrary.

Cmon you can’t be that thin skinned. No one is saying that and you know it. For a particular major  for a particular situation any school can make sense. And it’s not always their second choice. How many times does anyone need to hear Duke is great to feel validated. It’s great. It’s elite it’s superb it’s fantastic. It’s a lot of kids dream school   I agree with you. There’s no issue. it’s just not everyone’s dream school all the time and for every situation.

From my first post. So that’s  obviously not accurate
“Duke offers a phenomenal experience. Cameron indoor is once in a lifetime great. Tenting to get tickets for unc game is a great tradition. My nephew did the whole month this year. Alumni network is fantastic and rep is first tier”

Sorry pressed before it was complete.
Two -greats
One - phenomenal
One-  “Once is a lifetime”
One - fantastic
One - first tier
That’s Six accolades in 4 sentences. A lot more than “once”. Just want to be clear for OP as the debate is meaningless. Duke is in fact great.
Cheers and have good day.

@Nocreativity1 If you believe in the National rankings why is it not important for a student to pay attention to the underlying rankings of what they want to study??
Michigan is ranked #4 Engineering!!  https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/eng-rankings
And Finance also #4!!  https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-finance
Why should a student ignore this exactly?? IF the question is Engineering between the 2 schools isn’t it clear??  And since you entered Finance I think it is very clear as well.

Private Banker disingenuous at best. On three threads you have placed Duke behind U Michigan , Berkley and Wash U.  Not to mention the post you sight goes to great lengths to suggest Duke positive reputation is misplaced and a function of patents misplaced loyalty to Duke.
Fox Ruiz on your first point agreed I don’t claim any engineering knowledge. Ny comments were general reputation.  On your second point Duke doesn’t have a finance degree. Their economics and finance department however is ranked number one.

Not disingenuous just an actual factual quote. And if you don’t think people come on here with biases and decision creep. We just disagree. And in those three cases it was advice and opinion. Nothing more and nothing less.

Privatebanker thanks for calling it what is is.  Yours is a biased view not the independent thinker you referenced yourself as earlier. A truly independent thinker doesn’t allow biases to form their opinions.
Finally we can agree on something.
Cheers

Now. That’s not nice. If I think duke is great but not the be all end all that doesn’t make me biased. It’s called discerning.  My favorite nephew goes to Duke. I have no student there or Michigan and no student of mine has applied to either.  I have no mean boss from duke or was I ever jilted by a women from either. I’m open to debate but you’ve gotten a bit too personal and would suggest you move on. I will. My thoughts are generic. There are terms of service here and this has lasted one post too long.

I think this is a UM grad posing as a Duke grad to make Duke look bad, the rants, grammatical and spelling mistakes, not understanding the arguments, changing the discussion…the post you sight, ny comments, is is, patents misplaced loyalty, Berkley
