A few thoughts, money aside:
I would say that Haverford and Smith are stronger in the sciences than Midd.
Taking classes at Bryn Mawr is not a negative. It is very easy to do so and in fact most students in the bi-college will take at least a class or two on the other campus sometime within their 4 years. It’s a seamless relationship between the two schools and should be viewed as an extension of the campus and offerings - a positive. She could also see if Swarthmore and/or UPenn have any classes she might like to take in marine bio.
Your daughter will have no problem finding faculty mentors at Haverford (or Midd for that matter). Haverford offers plenty of student research opportunities as well as campus jobs. There is quite a bit of money available for summer research and summer internships and it pays more than $1200. Therefore, I wouldn’t overweight STRIDE from the benefits you’ve discussed. Being a Quaker school, Haverford isn’t big on having programs that single out certain students - no honors, no Dean’s List, EVERYONE does a thesis. It’s all about community and equal opportunity. That doesn’t mean their aren’t opportunities. There are plenty available.
As long as your daughter is aware of the facts and knows all the pros and cons of her choices, I’d let her make the decision. You were okay with her applying to schools with only need-based aid knowing that you did not qualify for it so I think you have to let her consider all her options once you’ve pointed out the facts to her.
ETA: She has 3 wonderful choices and all will provide a great 4 year experience. She needs to decide where she will be happiest.
Is the $16K total and annually? I assume the former as she personally couldn’t borrow the latter.

I’m not an athlete so I couldn’t possibly understand the athletic portion of this.
However, academically and financially, Smith seems like a great option and the best option for her.

I agree with @bobo44. I don’t fully understand the athletics piece either, but my D is about to graduate from Smith and she’s had a wonderful experience and so many opportunities. To get a STRIDE is incredible. I hope your D picks Smith! But GL whatever the decision!

I think the Smith coach will change his/her mind if your daughter is good.  It doesn’t appear they have a very good team this year so could use the help.

would choose middlebury or haverford in a heartbeat over smith if the financial equation were level. Miidd is in the super elite lac division and haverford is close. Smith was but is no longer. Still great especially with the money. It still has cachet too don’t get me wrong.  I would t make any of these choices around softball unless they were contingent for acceptance. Also if your D is lgbt Smith and Northampton are very accepting communities. As are the others too.
Smith for the finances.  Middlebury for overall.  Haverford if she really wants an intellectual journey.

The challenge of sports as a decision variable is that it is really hard to guess which kid is going to stay with their sport when they get to college. We have seen so many, many students who were 100% sure that they were going to be just as committed to their sport in college as they were in HS, and then drop it before the end of the first year. Not to mention the ones who get injured and have to stop playing.
Haverford & Smith are different enough that I would go by how she feels when she is on campus: go for the overall fit first: it is likely to matter longer than the sport angle. .

Middlebury has been making significant investments in the sciences over the past 20 years, hiring new faculty, building an incredible science center, and purchasing equipment that is the envy of many a small college. I believe they recently purchased a research boat that will cruise Lake Champlain. Don’t underestimate Middlebury when it comes to the sciences.

If softball is something that gives her joy and is something she wants to do, going to a school where she can’t do that isn’t a great idea.  Although she should also fully understand that having decided not to go through the cycle as a recruit,  the coaches may have obligations to players who did (at least for this year) so she should make sure she knows where she stands with them (which it sounds like where she is with Midd.)  It sounds like Haverford is in the sweet spot.
These schools all have different environments.  How did they feel to her? If she goes to H, can she do a semester/year elsewhere (abroad) in marine biology?

@OldbatesieDoc you are right to beware the angry coach.  I have two small college athletes and have been through this process.  That can cause a lot of problems.
As for the schools, I side with the crowd of not basing a life-long decision with the vagaries of this or that ranking list.  These are comparable schools academically.  Middlebury is the flavor of the month with the finance crowd these days.  But who cares?   When paisley ties come back into fashion, they’ll be enthusiastically wearing them and touting some other school.  That’s a fickle crowd.
I’d be proud to have my D attend any of the three, so if she fits well at all, and if playing the sport really matters then Haverford is your answer.
It’s a an unusual situation you find yourself in based in my experience.
