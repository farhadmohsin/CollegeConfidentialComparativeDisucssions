Neither Wesleyan nor Hamilton has anywhere near the kind of resources that Georgia Tech can provide for engineering, but if you want to be Pre-Med, Georgia Tech probably isn’t the best option. Are you sure that’s the major you’d like?

I agree that your choice of college will depend on how sure you are with respect to your intended major. Though Hamilton and Wesleyan would be excellent choices for pre-med studies, and even pre-engineering (essentially physics and math), they do not offer direct engineering programs.

@Waitwhatss:
For either Hamilton or Wesleyan (both great schools!) to be a top choice, you should enter with a strong interest in pursuing a range of arts and sciences fields through your elective choices (e.g., classics, religious studies, government, literature, history, geosciences, astronomy, sociology . . . or really any similarly diverse array of courses that might appeal to you). With respect to major choices that might be appropriate, you might consider computer science, math, physics, economics, or a combination from this group. In terms of post-graduate earnings potential, early career salaries can be found through U.S. News. Hamilton appears highest among the NESCAC LACs in this area. But, as stated, be sure their curriculum appeals to you based on your sincere academic interests.

If you have gotten this far, then you know that Hamilton’s flexible curriculum would allow you to take take nearly all of your courses in STEM fields such as math, physics and computer science. Moreover, Hamilton might be stronger in a field such as math (a core liberal art) when compared to even a STEM-focused school such as GIT. However, you might already sense whether you are the Georgia Tech type (either positively or negatively), and, if so, this should make your decision simpler.

Even if you decided to  do Teach for America for a year or so after college, you may choose to go to grad school, a professional school, or move on to a job where your experience will help get a foot in the door.

@Waitwhatss - First, take a deep breath. Your interest and affinity for STEM subjects puts you miles ahead of the average liberal arts and science graduate. Be careful taking various “return on investment” (ROI) calculi too literally. Hamilton may have the highest. BUT, Wesleyan also has among the highest percentage of seniors going into the visual and performing arts within NESCAC (10.6%) - notoriously risky careers - right after graduation while Hamilton has among the lowest (4.5%) So, obviously, that’s going to make a difference.

@Waitwhatss The problem is – of the three schools being considered – the best two schools for med school (Hamilton and Wesleyan) are the opposite of the best option for engineering (GA Tech). I would not consider a 3+2 program as a realistic option. Very few students end up doing them, which requires switching colleges after your junior year. I think the focus should be whether you really want to start out as pre-med or in engineering. GA Tech likely is a GPA killer for med school, especially if you are in engineering. But if you want to be an engineer, GA Tech is amazing. If you start out at Hamilton or Wesleyan and decide not to do pre-med, you could get a masters in engineering (with an extra year or two of school elsewhere), though that is sub-optimal compared to just going to GA Tech. Tough decision. If you can visit all of them, that would probably knock one or two of them out.

No, and I agree with you: I wish all of these Return On Investment (ROI) surveys would break their results out by major; it would make comparing apples to apples much simpler. Suffice it to say that a STEM major is going to have pretty much the same opportunities and drawbacks at any of the top 100 colleges or universities; grades and standardized tests are how you will  distinguish yourself from the pack - not the college’s pedigree.
If you major in Bio or Chem you are probably going to have to go on to graduate school of some sort to make a decent living. Computer Science is still a very hot major and you can find a job as a programmer right out of the box. The same is true for Engineering except that a B.S degree by itself hits a salary wall about six years after graduation (at which point, a lot of Humanities and Social Science majors start catching up) and you will want to pursue at least a Masters.
IMO, Physics and Math are still the sweet spot as far as intellectual exploration and practical applications are concerned. Physics and Math majors have been known to land on Wall Street in various capacities.

My son is currently a Hamilton / Dartmouth student. He is in the 3-2 engineering program and  loves it. Unlike the typical 3-2 where you leave the liberal arts college at the end of the 3rd year, for the Dartmouth plan the student studies at their LAC for freshman and sophomore year, then move on to Dartmouth for their junior year, when most of their friends are studying abroad. For their senior year they go back to their LAC, graduate with their friends and get their BA degree, and return back to Dartmouth for a 5th year and get their BE degree in an engineering discipline.
What is nice about this program is that the student gets an excellent STEM education at the LAC with very small class sizes where they get to really know their professors and do research as an undergraduate. At Thayer (Dartmouth’s Engineering School) you get a very project oriented engineering education with a strong entrepreneurial focus. Dartmouth is on a quarter system so many professors have their own engineering / tech companies they are running, bringing current real-world challenges to class.  Also, there is a certain camaraderie amongst all the 3-2 students from the various LAC’s.
Typically if you maintain a 3.5 or better at your LAC and take Calc I, II, III, Physics I, II, Chem, and CS, you get into Dartmouth. If I am not mistaken they get about 100 applicants a year, with about 40 or so getting accepted into the program each year.
There is no question that the 3-2 plan will require an extra year of education and the costs that go with that. However, that additional year provides you the ability to take the extensive math and science prereqs for an engineering degree, but also affords you the ability to take more humanities and social science courses. The part of the education you get at a LAC will be more discussion based (as opposed to a lecture based model), enabling you to become a more effective communicator and develop critical thinking skills. This is an investment that will make you a more marketable candidate with employers.

Some have said that getting an advanced degree in engineering can narrow rather than widen, job prospects due to the increased specialization. And there are many opportunities outside engineering firms for engineers.  Not having an advanced degree is not going to hold back strong engineer employees.

Yes, and for about the same salary as a computer programmer.

@akin67 - Thank you so much for sharing your experience with the 3+2 program.  I don’t mean to hijack the conversation, but may I ask, if you know, what the financial aid situation is like when a student does the 3-2 program?  Is the tuition and financial aid decision made at the engineering school, or is it Hamilton rates and financial aid for the whole 5 years?  I ask because I believe my son would be eligible for much more aid at one of the schools in the program, but I would like to see him get the writing/communications enrichment that Hamilton offers.  Unfortunately, though, I think Hamilton is going to be unaffordable for us - definitely would be at 5 years.

@Trixy34 For the first 4 years it will be the FA from the LAC. The first year of Dartmouth gets treated as a study abroad year. In Hamilton’s case, the cost of attending Dartmouth was about $3K more, so we were responsible for the additional $3K. In the 5th year of the program the student becomes a Dartmouth student where they are then subject to Dartmouth FA. Just want to point out that the curriculum at Hamilton is definitely challenging and will prepare your son well to take on the challenges at Dartmouth, perhaps better than some of the other schools. My son was able to get waived out of two courses and ended up taking more advanced alternatives at Dartmouth. I don’t know the reason for this but it seems, at least for now, that more students pursue this program from Colby, Skidmore and Vassar than from Hamilton. Best of luck to your son.

@Waitwhatss,
These are three good schools, but IMHO good schools do not train for high paying jobs.  They train your brain.  The risk of going to a school that trains for a job is that the skills you learn will become obsolete in ten years.
Also no school is going to get you a job, let alone a high paying job.  That is up to you.  While there are certain majors that tend to pay more after graduation, the simple fact that you graduate in that major doesn’t mean you will get a high paying job.
I know it is difficult, but look at salary and compensation over the long run, not for the year after you graduate.  Try to figure out what you like to do.   Chances are you will make much more money over your career in a field that you love than in a relatively high paying field that you don’t care for.
This probably doesn’t help choose a school.   Once you have determined the financial aid angle, how about choosing the school you like the best.
