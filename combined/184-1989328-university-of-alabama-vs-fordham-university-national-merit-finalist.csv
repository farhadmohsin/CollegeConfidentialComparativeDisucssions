So really, if we boil these down to main fit categories:

Academic fit: Fordham
Social fit: Alabama 
Sports fit: Tie?
Cost: Alabama 
Environmental fit: Tie?
Jobs/internships: Fordham 

Which environment do you prefer: weather, campus, city surroundings?
And if you had to choose, would you rather be a baseball player at Fordham or a baseball (and football/basketball…) fan at Alabama?
And can your family afford to pay for Fordham without taking on much debt?

I think the biggest thing to consider is your parents’ financial position. Do they have $60K set aside for your college or would that be a struggle for them? Do they have other children to educate or is it just you?
And how do you see yourself in 10 years? You are obviously very bright. Do you want to be a big-city lawyer? If so, Fordham gives you a foothold in NYC. Or do you want a more laidback life with lots of fun? Alabama probably only gives you entrance into … Alabama, but that might be just fine with you. Very different schools! Good luck!

If you live in or near NYC, you need to try somewhere else and decide what kind of place you want to live. At Alabama, you have a free ride to a very good education. School reputation is interesting and Jesuits are terrific, but the differences in education are not as different as you and others might think. You can fly to London probably through Atlanta because of the volume of national and international flights. Alabama is within driving distance to Florida, coastal Georgia, Nashville and Smokey Mountains…There is lots to see and do in the South and some clear cultural, political and religious differences too. There are opportunities for internships in the South. An education in the South is not second class unless you don’t apply yourself academically or spend too much time socializing. Football in the South is competitive and fun.
Finally, I can’t imagine asking my parents to spend $60000 tuition. What are you willing to let parents and siblings give up because of your tuition? Finally, a free ride is a luxury that allows you to travel, study, invest in your education, and sort out your adult life. There is serenity and satisfaction earning an education without worrying about money. Try the South. It is an opprtunity, not a prison sentence.

Don’t undersell the academics at Alabama.  Might be more challenging than you think…and you’re going to be surrounded by kids like you, who are chasing the merit money.  Smart kids, engaged kids!
I lived in NYC for a long time, and then moved to Alabama.  It was a rough transition, but I wasn’t on a college campus.  There are TONS of out-of-state students at Alabama these days.
The $60K is the winning argument, however.  That is a lot of money to be saving…and sets you up nicely for grad school.
My vote is for ROLL TIDE!

I think as far as the academics go, the 75th percentile at Fordham is about a 680-690 for math and English.
So 75% of students will be lower than that.
While the 75% percentile is a bit lower for the whole UA student body, the honors and the NMF students that you will be taking classes with will have higher stats than that.
You now need a 1480 plus SAT for the Presidential scholarship I think.
In NY housing on or off campus will be very pricey.
Take the money at UA and take advantage of all the opportunities it awards you.
The money your parents save can be used for law school.

I don’t think you’ll have a problem with being challenged academically, and a majority of students come from outside Alabama so you won’t be alone.

Of greater concern than the test scores of fellow students, when figuring out the quality of an education, are the following:

Faculty quality
Class sizes
Access to professors
Curricular setup
Available majors and classes
Academic support

In other words, it’s much more important to be able to hear and interact with a top-quality professor in a wide range of majors and classes set up to maximize breadth while also allowing you to “master” your major… and get help when you need it. Those are the things that, imo, comprise the bulk of a quality academic environment. Smart and engaged comrades help, but it’s more about what the school offers., IMO.

Yeah – if you’re around distracted people in class, or have teammates who are less than enthusiastic in a team assignment, that can suck. Of course, those issues have more to do with discipline and motivation than knowledge.
I think discussion settings are where large differences in scholastic ability might come out. Another place is in the grading curve. (Though in that case, the kid with lower stats can work hard and achieve strong grades too. Dedication can make up some of that ability gap. But in discussions, sometimes you have to change on the fly, and the difference in ability can become apparent.)

If you do go to Alabama, be careful that you don’t let the social and sports side of the experience come before your studies. This is not high school. Work hard first, and if your classes/grades are in good shape, then you can play hard.
Sometimes you’ll have to say no to a party, especially if UA celebrates “TGIT” like UW (-Madison) does. After a while I learned not to schedule Friday morning classes or labs, but sometimes it just can’t be helped, and you don’t ever want to be hung-over in class.

Wait, when you say full tuition for Fordham, do you mean you are getting a full tuition scholarship and are only responsible for room & board, etc?  Or do you mean that you would be paying full tuition and full room board expenses etc? (because if it’s the latter, it’s more than $60k per year)
And when you say it would be $100k, do you mean over the course of your entire education at Fordham?
Just curious as my younger son plays baseball, did Fordham offer any baseball scholarship money?  And at Alabama do you have an offer or would you be trying to get a walk on spot?

Don’t make your decision based on the MBA possibility.   If you do go for it right after undergrad, your MBA from a not top-rated school with zero work experience will not be worth much.  If you are serious about getting an MBA, you’d be better off working for a couple of years and then applying to higher rated programs.  Your employer may even pick up some of the costs.

Alabama Law is not necessarily a good reason to choose Alabama Undergrad. Only go to Alabama law if you have modest goals (think small law firm, PD/DA) and want to practice law in Alabama or the neighboring region because that’s where the vast majority of UA Law grads end up.
Better Law School&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1 year of free law school

Wildest dream brings up a good point .  Do you see yourself living in the south or northeast after graduation?  Not that you can’t move anywhere, but career services and alumni network will tend to be more strongly connected with compAnies in their area.

It sounds to me that you have done a great job of analyzing the pros and cons of both schools.   And both options sound great.  What is your gut telling you at this stage?  Seems like maybe it’s leaning towards Alabama.  Does Alabama also have club baseball?  If so, if you weren’t able to walk on the baseball team you could still play quality ball. ( without as big a time commitment as D1 baseball which could leave more time for study abroad and internships etc)

essentially free law school is a good reason to choose Alabama right? I mean only having to pay for one year of law school from a top 25 school seems like a no brainer to me.
[/quote]

Choose Alabama for the undergrad value, which includes saving money for grad school.  Do not choose it for the law school value.  You can make the law school choice at a much later date, after you have a better idea of your future geography and likely apply to some T14s as well.  (Do not underestimate how much more difficult it is to get a BigLaw interview, let alone a job, at a firm outside the region as an Alabama law student than it would be as a T14 law student.  The difference in ranking between, say, a #10 and #27 is much larger than it may seem and is not analogous to undergrad ranking systems, where such a difference would be slight.)

Not everyone wants or belongs at a T14. More importantly, why does everyone on CC assumes a student wants Big Law.  Geez!

@itsgettingreal17 so true… its a grind and there is high turnover.  I’m at Big Law with an ancillary group so slightly less of a grind but so many lawyers don’t enjoy the environment and move on.

True, not everyone belongs at a T14 or wants Big Law.  But there’s no denying that T14 affords options not available to most grads of other law schools, or at least makes them far more accessible.  I’m not a big proponent of rankings vs. success when it comes to undergrad, but law school is different.  Case in point, and I know it’s just anecdotal, but my brother graduated T14, decent but unspectacular grades, probably top half, with nothing special as far as law review or other credentials.  He stopped taking interviews after the first 9 firms, including several Big’s.  His wife went to a mid tier law school, similar resume.  She got interviews only with smaller regional firms.  The more prestigious firms will only look at the very top students from schools like hers.
Now even if you don’t necessarily desire Big Law, starting out there opens all kinds of doors.  Many move on to smaller firms, clerk for judges, and other things enabled by having those connections and that line on the resume.

@grant1509 I would expect nothing less than 3.8 from someone with your credentials.  With plus-minus grades at UA, an A+ being worth 4.33, the top students like you that gets lots of those have an easy time being at or near 4.0.  Every year there are hundreds of President’s List 4.0 grads.
The 170 LSAT is not as easy, but not unreasonable.  My brother actually had no intention of law school.  He was getting his MBA, and working at a test prep place to make some money.  He was teaching an LSAT review course.  Decided that if he’s teaching the course, he should take the test for the experience.  He got 175.  Then he said I guess I have to go to law school.
