Pitt has an excellent business school that is well regarded. So you already have an excellent option. I wouldn’t pass up Pitt for a chance at PSU with a summer start.  Ignoring rank, PSU isn’t appreciably better than Pitt’s CBA.  Most of the schools you are waiting on are reachy. Good luck!

Pitt business is a great option to have, congratulations.
Your ECs are impressive, so I doubt that has been/will be an issue for acceptances. I don’t know the detail and rigor of your HS courses, but your ACT score is below the 25% level for several of the schools you applied to. Fordham and Babson acceptances are higher probability than the rest of the schools on your list, and most of the rest I would classify as high reaches (with Villanova a reach).
Don’t fret over decisions until you are faced with them…if you need summer earnings to pay for college, I would choose Pitt over Smeal summer…but only you can make these decisions. Good luck, keep us updated.

How high did you score on your three subject tests for Georgetown? This will be key.
Had you taken calculus before you took statistics? (Reaching the highest possible level in math is crucial for business schools).
Smeal is the most selective college at PSU - only about 10% students are pre-admits from high school. The regular path is DUS-&gt; qualifying classes=&gt; admission to Smeal as a junior.
Your ECs are impressive and will be useful for the private universities you applied to.
ECs matter for Schreyer but dont really matter for general university Admissions. In addition, this year was totally weird due to their adopting BOTH early action AND common app.
Pitt is an excellent choice. Is it affordable? If so, you’ve got a great safety.

Wharton considers that “AP Calc AB” is the default expected class for the lower level students since their first math class is caled calc 2 elsewhere. However if your school didn’t offer calc and your GC indicated you took ‘thevmet rigorous’ curriculum at your school, you wouldn’t be penalized.
Look, it’s not your fault since apparently you had no guidance.
Have you received financial aid packages? Is Pitt affordable? Last year there was a first Gen student (first to go to college) who ended up stuck because hed been admitted to Pitt and wasn’t affordable…

I too agree that Pitt business is a great option to have. Once you’re in college, aim for good grades - will you still need to work many hours to fund college? I have many students who work far too many hours and are unable to dedicate time to their classes. 20 hours a week is usually the max suggested for work.
With your work experience and a decent GPA from Pitt, you can target  decent internships in the summers, I think. My DS1 did not have hot stats to get into a top CS program, but had a lot of self motivated programming experience. He is now a sophomore at a mid-level university and got a summer internship based on decent grades and experience.
Also, look into taking some general education credits at your local community college in the summer before starting college… Many have class schedules that work with students’ work schedules.( Make sure all credits transfer) This could ease the load in the regular semesters if you are working.

Be careful about taking community college classes after HS graduation - some colleges consider this makes you a transfer and may rescind you. Once you’ve registered you can do that with no worry after checking what will transfer.
The advice above about working is spot on - in fact, research shows that working more than 15 hours a week has a severe impact on grades, often delaying graduation.

@MYOS1634  I suspect that’s not true for most colleges, but the OP should check. My D took language classes the summer before starting freshman year at a 4-year and none of the schools to which she was accepted viewed that as a problem. The credits did transfer very easily.

How do the net prices of Pitt and PSU compare?
What do the net price calculators of the other schools you are waiting for estimate?
How do those numbers compare to what you and your parents can actually pay?  (Note that you can only borrow $5,500 first year without a cosigner.)
Based on what you wrote above, it looks like lowest cost will be the main factor in your college choice (if any are affordable at all).

If your parents are contributing nothing, I can’t see how either Penn State or Pitt will be affordable.  Pitt does have a new financial aid program for students who are Pell grant eligible, in that they will match the Pell grant (see link below).  What is your family’s EFC?  Did you file the FAFSA and PHEAA state grant forms?   Are your parents low income or just unwilling/unable to pay anything?  I would suggest applying to some of the PASSHE (true state) universities that have accredited business schools (West Chester, IUP, Bloomsburg, Clarion, Shippensburg), though even those schools will be a financial reach without some family support.  If your family is low income, you also might get better financial aid at a private college, of which Pennsylvania has many.

Either Pitt or Penn State will cost more than $30,000 a year without financial aid, unless you can commute from home to one or the other.  I highly doubt you can earn $75,000 in the summer.  $7,500 maybe if you are very lucky.  You can only borrow $5500 your freshman year.  Your parents would have to borrow or cosign loans for the remainder.  Most outside scholarships are competitive, are for small amounts, and are not renewable.  The best aid, whether merit or need-based, comes from the colleges/universities themselves.

Normal earnings for a summer would be 3.5-4k. So, 7.5k would be excellent. 75k is basically impossible unless you get involved in shady stuff but you might have forgotten the period between 7 and 5 ;).
Do follow up with that executive, send your resume, etc.
Check your admitted student portal at both PSU and Pitt as your financial aid may appear there.

If ‘relatively high gross income’ means 75+k (125? 200?) then you’re not eligible for much.
What’s your FAFSA EFC?
If your family owns a business operation, odds are that NPC aren’t totally accurate - but how much did most NPCs indicate?
If your parents’ EFC is not zero and they will contribute zero, you need merit aid.
With zero family help, anything above 11k is likely too much, which means you’d need a quick turnaround application “just in case”. You said your parents don’t value college (although nowadays it’s a signal all employers expect for non minimum job positions) which means they may well hope that your acceptances turn out too expensive and you can’t go.
You should apply to Youngstown State and/or UToledo and/or WCU ASAP (like, today, because March is around the corner and honors program+scholarships will soon be gone).

I would have thought it would be cheaper to go to the other campuses plus you don’t need to stay on campus… isn’t that correct?

The state grant is an estimate. Last year the maximum state grant per semester for state related schools was $1,886 a semester I believe. But that doesn’t help much.
You will have about $23,000 of aid. But it costs at least $32,000 at Pitt.
Behrend tuition and fees should be closer to $15,000. If you could commute there for the first two years (possibly less with AP credits), then you might be able to save up money for transferring to he main campus for the last two years.
Branch campuses might have some need based scholarships available.
You would get a Pell Grant, a smaller state grant (maybe around $3,000), and maybe merit. You should be able to work on weekends.

You might win some local scholarships but they are often only for one year.

Your parents can take on 10K in Parent PLUS loans for you (I hope you’d work and earn enough to cover the 1K gap + the rest of the money for books and incidentals).
But since you’re low income that’s really unkind of you to do that to them - if they don’t have the money now, how will they have it in 4 years?
Is Behrend affordable since you don’t have matching grants there?

Do so ASAP then, I think there’s an ACT soon too but the SAT deadline for April has passed and you’d have a late fee.
