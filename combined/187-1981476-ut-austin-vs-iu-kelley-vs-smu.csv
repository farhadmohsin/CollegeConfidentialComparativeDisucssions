Do you think your daughter would be happier at a smaller school with smaller classes? If so, then SMU would be best. Would your daughter prefer 4 seasons or is she okay with hot weather? If she wants to see snow in the winter and and falls and springs that aren’t too hot than she would like IU. What kind of environment is important to her? IU is in a great college town that’s not too small or too big. SMU and UT Austin are in major cities. If she seeks more diversity in terms of race and socioeconomics then she might find more of that at UT and IU.

What does she want to do/study? What goals?
Since she’s International, she’ll likely have to go back home, right?
BTW, often times, it’s the strength of the school in the major that matters.
You should know that rankings rank by their methodology, which may or may not be relevant to you. What exactly about the rigor about you worried about?
In the US, faculty don’t go off of something like the USNews or any overall rankings. The quality of the faculty at b-schools like Kelley and WashU Olin would be about the same, in fact.

My son also was admitted to those 3 business schools and we’ve visited each campus twice. UT Austin is urban with a VERY diverse student body. It appeared to me to be way more diverse than IU or SMU. From what I’ve gathered, the business school ranks much higher than SMU and slightly higher than IU. However, it’s a very big campus and most of the kids are from Texas who attend. SMU is a beautiful campus in downtown Dallas, but it definitely had the feel of being more “campus-like” to me than UT. I’ve heard it is more preppy with an upper middle class/ “wealthier” status attached to it, but I didn’t see a ton of that. IU has a beautiful college campus and the Kelley school is phenomenal as well. I’ve heard employers love to hire Kelley kids. I believe most of the IU kids get jobs in Chicago or Midwest area.
You mentioned a concern about rigor at SMU and Kelley. Did you mean that the programs might be TOO rigorous? Just wondering what you have heard or read about that.

@maplefall: try to have your daughter define what she means by “city”. In the US, it’s not necessarily “easily walkable”, not necessarily “animated at all times”, not necessarily “excellent train/bus system/ public transportation”, however it does mean high rises, parks, lots of restaurants, businesses, etc. Depending on where you’re from, you may want to explore that more explicitely. NYC or Boston are very different from Dallas, Austin, or Bloomington. Each has advantages and disadvantages.
Note: ask whether dorms have A/C.

really depends on what she is looking for with the feel.  I will say right now I compete directly with mcCombs kids and a few plan 2 kids from UT Austin.  If she is not in the business school at UT I don’t think it is worth it.  Between Kelley and Cox that is more of a best fit question.  The entirety of SMU undergrad is the size of Kelley, so that is more just a question of what she is interested in class sie, whether, etc.  Many of the kids I go to school with were in at ut mccombs, and chose SMU.  They were not plan 2 or mccombs honors though - those are on another level. Great opportunities for sure wherever she may go.

Mccombs transfer i do not know enough about, have to imagine it is somewhat difficult or they would have admitted off the bat. And yes rank does matter - to an extent - I agree smu generally lags about 10-15 spots (has always been top 25 in business week) back of Mccombs.  That being said SMU has great recruiting and for post graduate like the other two, so I wouldn’t discount it.  Whatever best fit will be most important.

I’ll defer to you about your expertise about relative prestige in your country.
In the US, business people know what the tiers are and generally ignore the rankings (where schools move around all the time). I’d say Kelley and McComb are roughly the same tier. McComb may be a little higher. But she hasn’t been admitted to McComb.

She’s not in McCombs so you can’t compare McCombs to the others. Assume she’ll get a degree in Economics. Another issue is that she didn’t make or apply for honors at UT which puts her at a disadvantage. (The order of priority for opportunities, contacts, etc, would be BHP or Plan II -&gt;McCombs-&gt;Economics with Honors-&gt;Economics).
Does she want economics or Business? Economics can be more flexible and can allow her to add some electives to personalize her profile. She may be able to add a Business certificate to it, develop expertise in US culture (through classes in American studies, African American studies, Hispanic studies)nifbshe plans to work for a TNC that does business with the US.
UT will also be much more diverse (ethnically and socio economically) than SMU. SMU business offers excellent contacts, networking, internships, etc. It is also rather homogeneous. So if your concern is internships and living in a big city, SMU would have the edge.
If you want diversity, UT has the edge.
In terms of political vibe, SMU is conservative and UT is liberal.

I have better examples: Missouri, Cincinnati, Oklahoma, and UIC are all ranked below IU by USNews.
Yet Mizzou is one of the top 3 journalism schools in the country. Cincy has one of the top design schools (and musical theatre programs) in the country. OU has one of the top meteorology programs in the country. UIC Nursing is highly respected. In each of those fields, those schools are considered powerhouses. For instance, design people could care less about Cincy’s USNews ranking. They care more about the fact that Cincy design grads are top-notch.
BTW, the USNews rankings can be gamed. I would not rely on them.
I personally prefer my tiers based off of alumni achievements:

@maplefall - my daughter is a freshman.  She had some good choices, like your daughter, and I didn’t think SMU was going to make the top 3.  After final visits to the other choices - and none of them feeling quite right - she made a trip to SMU by herself for an admitted student weekend.  Within the first few hours, she knew she had found her place.  She works hard at her studies (she is an engineering major) but has had the time and opportunity to be involved with a few campus organizations.  Because she has been involved and met lots of different people, she has had a very good experience so far.  Sounds like your daughter has some great options.  Obviously there were more highly ranked options for engineering schools but we weren’t entirely sure she would enjoy engineering and hoped she would choose a school with lots of other options if she decided to change majors.  Rankings are important, I guess, but we didn’t really care all that much.  Factors like travel distance (she’s 1000 miles away but a short, relatively inexpensive direct flight), job / internship opportunities in large city (Dallas), active campus ministry (we are Catholic), affordability with merit scholarships, and a small, supportive engineering program played into her decision more than any ranking.

ARWU is completely research-based (so would only tell you about faculty research prowess in mostly STEM and some social sciences). Williams wouldn’t even be ranked and Dartmouth is ranked extremely lowly by ARWU, for instance. A school like IU who’s strengths are in business, music, and dance (and doesn’t even offer engineering) would not do well in that ranking. But how much does a heavily STEM-based research ranking tell you about Kelley undergrad?
I used the Forbes subrankings because they have a ranking of “American Leaders”, per capita student awards, and per capita PhDs. I can’t find those alumni achievement rankings elsewhere.
Graduation rate mostly tells you how strong (and wealthy) entering students are. Salary is heavily influenced by major (and the mix of majors differs a lot; IU doesn’t have engineering; RPI and GTech offer almost no majors outside of STEM).
The elite professional school ranking is from a WSJ Feeder ranking from years back. I’ll try to find it.

ARWU is completely research-based (so would only tell you about faculty research prowess in mostly STEM and some social sciences). Williams wouldn’t even be ranked and Dartmouth is ranked extremely lowly by ARWU, for instance. A school like IU who’s strengths are in business, music, and dance (and doesn’t even offer engineering) would not do well in that ranking. But how much does a heavily STEM-based research ranking tell you about Kelley undergrad?
I used the Forbes subrankings because they have a ranking of “American Leaders”, per capita student awards, and per capita PhDs. I can’t find those alumni achievement rankings elsewhere.
Graduation rate mostly tells you how strong (and wealthy) entering students are. Salary is heavily influenced by major (and the mix of majors differs a lot; IU doesn’t have engineering; RPI and GTech offer almost no majors outside of STEM).
The elite professional school ranking is from a WSJ Feeder ranking from years back. I’ll try to find it.

OK, here is the WSJ ranking:

Definitely an East-Coast bias (possibly because Stanford wasn’t willing to share data?)
I know that in business, the top MBA programs are the M7 (Stanford, HBS, Wharton, Chicago Booth, MIT Sloan, Columbia, Northwestern Kellogg) while for law, YHS-CCN are the top 6.
Of those 13, the breakdown between East Coast, Midwest, and West Coast is 8-3-2.
