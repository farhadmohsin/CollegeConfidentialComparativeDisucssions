Why not RPI or Case?
I’m not sure how much outsiders can help you with hubby.
So what choice would he make? What does D like? Who likes what for what reasons and how much are you willing to pay?

What doesn’t she like about Cornell?  The weather?  RPI and Case will have similar weather. One great thing about Cornell engineering is that it is 50% female, which is unusual for an engineering school. My D is a freshman MechE major at Cornell and absolutely loves it.  Cornell has so many opportunities to get involved, especially for engineers. She is heavily involved in one of the big project teams, which had given her a great network of friends from all years, as well as real hands-on engineering training.  Cornell has a very strong alumni network as well, especially in the NY area.  I’m an alum myself, and spend a lot of time mentoring recent Cornell grads who want to go into my field. D also looked at RPI but was wary of the lopsided gender ratio, and its extreme tech focus (even the ""liberal arts’ requirements are tech classes).  I don’t know much about VaTech. $30K is a big chunk of money though - only you can decide whether it will be worth it.
Edit -  Is that $30K total or $30K per year?  If that is per year, then that is a much bigger consideration - not sure Cornell is worth $120K more over those other schools.

If her father isn’t willing to pay then he gets no say.
If he doesn’t pay, can you afford Cornell out of income and savings?
(DO NOT take on parents loans for Cornell just because dad is pushing for it!)
If you can afford Cornell: has she visited? Or does she dislike it because it’s Dad’s alma mater?
If she doesn’t like Cornell, what’s your rationale as to why you’d pay for her to go there?
Case would be a nice compromise - nice urban area, private university, excellent for STEM, variety in class offerings, less skewed m:f ratio than at RPI.
Then again, RPI is a powerhouse in STEM - in case academics matter most to her their focus is clear and strong. (The city it’s in isn’t the best and the m:f ratio is really skewed but the reputation in industry is great).
See if she can do overnights at Vtech and Case. It’ll clear things up: does she prefer a city or a college town, etc.

Send a letter to Cornell Financial Aid highlighting the situation with your 10-year old. You’ll have to provide pretty detailed information so it might feel intrusive. However a medical situation and having to send a disabled child to private school for accomodations as well as costs associated with disability CAN be taken into account and may result in Cornell offering a bit in financial aid.
Also, are you sure you input the fact you’d have TWO in college (UMiami + daughter) in the CSS Profile? Check.

As an engineer your husband should understand there is no discernable difference in the engineering education she will receive as these schools

There will be differences in opportunities outside of engineering.
So what about Case?
Is she guaranteed her major at VTech?

Has your daughter looked into Hypatia, the living-learning community for female engineering students at Virginia Tech? I had a son at VT. He loved it there. Just anecdotal, but my son had a female Cornell engineering student on his team for an internship. They were both offered full time positions at graduation. VT has a very large Career Fair. There are  detailed post grad surveys available  online and VT engineers are very well recruited by many different companies. Of course, Cornell is an excellent choice as well. Any of these schools will provide an excellent education. She may do best at the school she feels most comfortable at, which may not end up being where others think she should go or want her to go ! Good luck with the decision!

This is just my opinion, but I bet she’d be very happy at VT.  My niece is graduating from there in a month (tears!) - after my sister her mama (a quarter century ago LOL).
They both love VT with all their hearts.
It’s a thing, truly!

“She doesn’t like Cornell all that much.”  That is significant when there are so many other good schools out there.

Agree with you @Gudmom.  A 3.0 should not be a problem and most kids do get their first choice of major . Glad you enjoyed your visit to Virginia Tech. It is a lovely campus with many friendly students and great food!    Enjoy your visit to Cornell.

Many times young adults want their own experience and following in dads footsteps isn’t super appealing. Cornell is well known to be a bit of meat grinder for kids in premed. Not sure about engineering. Rensselaer is a preeminent school. VT is also elite in the global picture.
Cornell is great but it doesn’t automatically lead to a life of leisure and riches or guaranteed happiness. If so your hubby would write s check for all four years and be done with it. It’s a long life and being happy is more important in the end than anything. Any of these schools offer your d a great chance at all that is good in life and a great engineering job if that what she wants.
Tell him to let her grow and be independent. It’s our first job as parents.

Question, if you knew you couldn’t afford Cornell and Yale, why apply?  To say that you got in to an ivy?  Maybe I’m naive, but I would think before anyone applied to a college they would have a pretty good assessment of what they can afford and not afford.
Congrats on VT!

It’s been fun following this thread. I have an incoming Hokie engineer, wait listed at Cornell and a few others, accepted early action for UVA Engineering. Based on family income, it’s possible we could pay less at one of the wait listed schools, but it sounds like Cornell isn’t likely to offer much. And even then, we got great vibes at VT, loved the campus, and kid loves sports (both playing and spectating) and feels the extracurriculars are an especially good fit. Reading the comments from those who’ve had kids at VT, their impressions of the Cornell grind, and positive impressions of the culture compared to other campuses makes me think it’s time to fully commit and stop checking wait list status. Similar to your experience with the Cornell prestige, plenty of people both in and OOS, think we’re nuts for turning down UVA.

I’ve enjoyed reading this thread @Gudmom   Congratulations to your D on an excellent choice. My S is finishing up his freshman year of engineering at VT. He was rejected by Cornell. We were disappointed at the time, but in hindsight it was lucky. VT is the right place for him.
He made the 3.0 GPA cut for guaranteed choice of engineering major next year at VT, with room to spare. Your D will not have a problem.
If it’s not too late, she should apply for Hypatia. I was worried that Galileo might be engineering overkill for my S, but he has thoroughly enjoyed it and took advantage of all the opportunities that came with the program. They’re all in it together. Highly recommended.
Your whole family will love the VT experience.
