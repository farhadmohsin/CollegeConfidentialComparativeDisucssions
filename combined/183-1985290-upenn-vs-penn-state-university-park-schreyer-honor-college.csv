There are quite a few differences at the school which should make it easier to choose one:
UPenn - Urban environment - traditional College Campus in the midst of a major city
PSU - Rural environment - College town
UPenn - Mid size
PSU - Huge
Both have Greek environment but PSU very large Fraternity Environment and center of social scene
UPenn will probably have more opportunity for research just by sheer numbers - less students and similar number of labs.
If UPenn is actually less - please confirm total cost for both to make sure - then it would seem to be the better choice unless you don’t like cities (or you live in Philly and want to get ‘away’ for college)

I would think that UPenn is going to be more rigorous but UPenn does have pretty strong grade inflation so I don’t think the increased rigor isn’t going to greatly effect your GPA.  You’d more likely be able to find easier classes at PSU to mix in with your core/major classes.
I think you could get better/more advice if this was in the UPenn forum.

No question in my mind that the academic support you will receive at UPenn is much better. Additionally there are far more medical research  and volunteer opportunities. UPenn is an excellent private school with vast resources. Penn State is a very large more impersonal place that struggles to get money from the state.

UPenn, no doubt. For that cost, in a heartbeat. Schreyer is a top Honors college, but the resources at Penn will totally change things for you, especially if like 75% would be pre-meds, you change your mind along the way… And it’s 1/4th the cost of Penn State!!

Do you realize that University of Pennsylvania is an Ivy League university and one of the best universities in the world? The quality of student will be vastly superior, on average, to the students at Penn State, which is a public university for the state of Pennsylvania. Plus, the resources, the people you will meet there, and having University of Pennsylvania on your resume will bring returns for the rest of your life.

“@MYOS1634 @ClassicRockerDad would it be difficult to get research opportunities at UPenn since they have such a large amount of graduate students?”
Penn has significant opportunities for research and a top 5 research hospital right on campus.
“@ccfk1221 I thought Schreyer at Penn State is comparable to the ivies (at least that is what I heard from my friends)”
There is a very significant difference in these two schools, and in their students. On average, it is not close. “Comparable” is just what you say to people who were rejected from Penn to make them feel better. They will get an excellent education at Penn State. However, it is not comparable. You should choose Penn.
Based on your questions, I strongly suggest that you contact Penn and work this summer with an advisor to understand as much as possible about Penn. It is an extraordinary place, but you have to know how to study, prepare for classes, how not to get behind and how to capture the benefits of all of the clubs and opportunities it offers. There are more opportunities there than hours in the day. You have no idea right now how much you don’t know. The sooner you begin to understand the opportunity you have and how to fully capture the benefits, the better.
If you can do that, you will receive a truly world-class education.

UPenn gives only financial aid, so no minimum GPA is required to keep your aid. How about your aid at Penn State? Is some of that merit money? Is there a minimum GPA to keep that merit money?
Are you afraid that Penn will be too hard? I think that Much2learn had some great ideas on contacting an advisor and preparing for college. Penn State has some huge classes and they won’t be any easier than Penn. At either school, you will need to hit the ground running. Penn would not have admitted you if you weren’t up to the work!!!

Penn has all the resources to make sure you succeed but you have to take advantage of them and work hard. My D has a friend from High School that is at Penn and he is on academic probation this semester because he slacked off last semester and didn’t work as hard as needed and didn’t take advantage of the resources available.
As for your Grade Inflation classes - yes they curve the class to something like a B+ and give out a minimum amount of As.

@muchtolearn While Penn State overall may not be in the same league as Penn its harder to get into Schreyer than Penn.  I know a few local Philadelphia kids who were accepted to Penn but not to Schreyer.  So its not just to make kids feel better.  Philadelphia area kids have an easier in to Penn.  1/3 of my son’s graduating class will attend UPenn next year while only one or two (if that) were accepted to Schreyer.

11: to be fair, OP will be in Schreyer, so peer quality and small classes will be par for the course BUT.. only within Schreyer.
At UPenn, it’ll be like that 24/7. All your classes will be good. All the students will be strong. At this point you can’t even imagine the resources you’ll have available, the opportunities you’ll have. Being a student at an Ivy League is unique and an opportunity you shouldn’t pass… especially since it’s much cheaper than Penn State!
You’ll be part of a special network dedicated to helping you develop leadership skills, find mentors and internships, and connect with peers.

An example in which UPenn will differ from Penn State: both have good career centers that will help you find an internship. But it’s your first internship, so, it’s unpaid. If you’re at Penn State, your choice is either to drp the unpaid internship and work to make money or take the internship that will advance you in your career.but be without any money earned over the summer which you will need to pay tuition. If you’re at Upenn, no worry, they will give you a stipend to compensate the fact your internship is not paid and so you can get on your career path right away with no financial trouble - basically you have your bread and eat it too. That’s the sort of difference UPenn endowment makes.

@angelababy30  Penn seems like a nobrainer unless you have you heart set on Penn State.  Although, there is an older study (that was updated more recently) by a Princeton economist that found no difference in outcomes between a student who gets into Penn but chooses Penn State.  You will succeed where ever you go and you should examine the differences between the schools in the factors that are most important to you.

I recommend that you contact Penn admissions and schedule an appointment with a counselor either by telephone or in person. Just call the main number (215) 898–7507, and ask for admissions. Once you get to admissions tell the person you have been admitted, and that you have some questions and would like to speak with a counselor.
Talk with the counselor about your concern about grades in pre-med. Ask about what a sample schedule would look like. Ask about research opportunities (Basically any student can get involved in research). Ask about opportunities for pre-meds to get involved in clubs. Ask about opportunities to get guidance about issues like what med school applicants need besides a GPA and an MCAT score. Tell them about your other acceptance too. Let them help you.
You should go to Quaker days too, but begin getting more information right away. Knowing more will help you make a better decision.
Also, consider the fact that most pre-meds at any college decide not to stay in pre-med. None of those students think it will be them switching out. If that happens to you, you are better off at Penn.

CM is a very good school, but it just isn’t comparable except in computer science. CMU does not have nearly the resources of Penn. For example, the Penn endowment is almost 10 times larger than CMU’s.
From my perspective, it is pretty clear that Penn offers you the best opportunity. The important thing for you is getting a lot of guidance on how to capitalize on all of those opportunities. The opportunities they offer will not benefit you if you don’t know they exist or how to access and prioritize them. That is why I recommend that you begin by discussing that with an admissions counselor. Penn has incredible opportunities, but it is also fairly large and complex. Someone with experience can be a big help in guiding you in capturing the best opportunities that are aligned with your interests.

The opportunities they offer will not benefit you if you don’t know they exist or how to access and prioritize them. That is why I recommend that you begin by discussing that with an admissions counselor. Penn has incredible opportunities, but it is also fairly large and complex. Someone with experience can be a big help in guiding you in capturing the best opportunities that are aligned with your interests.

Don’t worry about housing at Penn.  Although on paper housing is not guaranteed for your last years, students are able to find on campus housing if they desire to stay on campus (another dorm is being built) and off campus housing is easy to secure if desired.
Settle in your freshman year and then apply for assistant research positions.  With both the University Hospital and Children’s Hospital on campus, undergraduates often assist graduate students.  This is a terrific way to spend time learning and get paid.
Use the resources; free tutoring is available…  On the other side, if you get great grades and decide to be a tutor, the pay is more than double PA minimum wage…
CMU and Penn have a very different culture and student body.  Visit if you are able…
A few things to think about at any elite private school.  Will it bother you to be surrounded by students with extraordinary economic advantages?  You will find your own group of friends and they will likely be lifelong friends, but it sometimes takes a while to sort out.  Often the differences are purely economical (dining out, entertainment, extravagant vacations on breaks) and you may find that wealthier students arrive having already taken (are repeating) freshman courses.  Don’t despair, there are plenty of opportunities to work on campus and truly bright self-motivated students have already learned to independently study (a huge advantage).

Also if you are a Philly public high school kid you’ll be a part of the Mayor’s Scholars Program and you’ll get even more support and a peer advisor.
Edit: see that you are in the region.  They may still invite you to the Mayor’s Scholar Program if you are in a surrounding county (Chester, Delaware, Montgomery or Bucks).

You have been admitted. The Admissions Office isn’t judging you anymore. Admitted students are part of the Penn family. Now Penn needs to ensure that you are supported and successful.
You have what it takes to succeed, or they would not have admitted you, and Penn has the classes, support, resources, and opportunities to make this a life-changing four years for you. The critical thing is to connect early with people who can guide you to access and take full advantage of those resources and begin that process early.
As you begin to do that, realize that at Penn rigorous academics is only a piece of the puzzle. Getting involved in extracurricular activities like research, internships, clubs, travel abroad, etc. are a big part of the experience. Developing a social network is also important. Social connections often begin with pre-orientation activities, which you should participate in, your dorm, and the clubs you join. It is helpful to make an effort to make friends early because everyone is trying to make friends at that point.
It will be challenging, but you will be a big success!

No, you are already part of the University of Pennsylvania family, as @Much2learn said. They will not rescind your acceptance for asking questions. Going to Penn is your ticket to an upper-middle class life. It may be a bit intimidating at first, but that’s OK. Clearly you are qualified. They would NEVER admit a student that was not qualified. You have to take the plunge. You won’t regret it.
Tell us a little about your background.

The Quad is where most freshmen live and a great place to make new friends and meet people you would have never met otherwise. The students from all four colleges are mixed, which is excellent. My D ended up being good friends with some people who she has about zero in common with on paper, but their personalities clicked. It is priceless when that happens.
The rooms are not the best, but it is a right of passage at Penn to say you lived in the Quad. Most students will say that they are glad they did it, but they would not want to do it again. The rooms are not anything special, but they made a lot of friends there. That is the main point of being freshmen together.

CURF links undergraduate students with research opportunities.  Sometimes it is as simple as approaching one of your professors to ask.  Graduate students are taking classes, completing research, and many are learning to be instructors, so they are very willing to teach you what you need to know in order to assist.
In addition to the Quad, Hill is also a designed to be a community with small rooms and large community spaces.  It is on the edge of campus and next to the engineering quad.

Do attend the special overnight visit and stay. Try to get an idea of the campus and its dorms then, but spend time in the library (see if it makes you feel like studying), eat in the cafeteria (to see if students are social as well as if you find food you like), go to the gym and try to join a game or class, and of course attend classes (do you feel stimulated? are the students interested? Don’t worry if it seems complicated: it’s a college course and you’ve not taken the first part  so focus on engagement, interest levels, etc.)
