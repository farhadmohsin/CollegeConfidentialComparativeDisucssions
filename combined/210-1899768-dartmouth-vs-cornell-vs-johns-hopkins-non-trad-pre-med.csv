@ezbreezy8022 Hopkins has severe grade deflation. Also Cornell is a bit grade-deflated too but nowhere near as bad as Hopkins. Grade inflation/deflation is a important consideration for pre-med student. GPA can literally make you or break you in med school admissions. Personally my first choice would be Dartmouth and second Cornell and I would then apply to Hopkins for med school.
All three schools are more or less similarly prestigious, probably Dartmouth and Cornell a bit more for undergrad because of the ivy league tag.  For medical school Hopkins is more prestigious.

GPA can break you for med school…even at a name-brand school.  A parent here on CC was shocked last year when her DD didn’t receive any interview invites with a 3.5 GPA and strong MCAT …she was at a top 5 school.

Where on earth are you getting the deflation stats?  JHU’s average GPA across the campus is a 3.35.  Is that major grade deflation?  Is Cornell’s “nowhere near that bad”?  Where do you pull this stuff.
As for prestige, I would argue JHU over both (I chose Hopkins over Cornell but did not apply to Dartmouth). But that is subjective as well.

I was speaking specifically for pre-med not overall. The reputation of Hopkins being brutal for pre-med has for some reason persisted. Maybe it is not true as you say,  but I a far from the only one with this perception. Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful.
Cornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application.
As for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent. There is not a big actual different but Cornell and Dartmouth probably benefit because they are ivies.

we do hear that premed is a grind at JHU, but maybe it’s not worse than any other school.
Whether a school is known for grade deflation or grade inflations isn’t really relevant except if the student is premed.  Schools that have grade inflation still heavily weed the premed prereqs.

@penn95 you of all people coming from penn know that yield can be manipulated if hopkins were to take the same proportion of people ED (especially if they took more than 50% ala Penn). I too have friends that did pre-med (and are still there) at Hopkins as did my roommate, so I’d think being closer to the vest is more reputed than your third hand assertions.
Cornell selectivity is also not quite apples to apples since they have a CALS division.
What’s also clear is that Hopkins is enrolling more academically accomplished students (similar to what Northwestern began doing in the past) - while still maintaining yield, which makes the lower yield more impressive than Cornell or Dartmouth.  Hopkins also isn’t just taking high scorers with potential lower rank ala vandy (with 87% ranked in top 10%)
SATs of enrolled freshman:
Hopkins:
SAT (M+V old scale):1420 to 1570
Freshman in top 10%: 94%

At the end of the day, premed comes down to tests that are curved.  My roommate went to tons of parties and still did well enough to get into Columbia med with a 3.7 GPA from Hopkins.  Some of it is intelligence - another is time management.  In no way are students going out of their way to not help one another.  People know Hopkins is tough - but this fosters camaraderie since people have the same common goal.  The acceptance rate to Harvard med is like 3% - do people have much to gain by not helping their fellow man when 2 minds are better than one? I personally was not premed, but I was 1 bio course and 1 orgo course away from being one, and I did fine.
The only people that complain and moan about premed at Hopkins are ones that did not go there or had a tough time collaborating (luckily these are in the far minority).

Overall yield can be manipulated, sure, but RD yield cannot. Btw Dartmouth nd Cornell accept a % of their class ED that is similar to Hopkins.
For the class of 2020:
Hopkins RD Yield: ~27.5%
Dartmouth RD yield: ~37%
Cornell RD yield: ~40.9%
(Penn RD yield: ~50%+, only since you mentioned Penn manipulating yield - it does but still has a high RD yield)
Saying that Hopkins admits more academically accomplished students is just not true.
Dartmouth SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020: (670+680) - (780+780)
Cornell SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020      : (650+680) - (750+780)
Comparison to Cornell is not apples to apples since Cornell has some non-tradiditonal program that attract students with lower scores. Even that small difference does not suggest a actual difference in student quality. As for Dartmouth, it has slightly higher stats on paper.
Also many top schools do not solely focus on scores and GPA, they dont mind admitting some special students who have created a company or have done something else out of the box but have lower stats.

Chicago’s significant yield increases with no ED dependency is not something that is organic.

@StevensPR RD yield cannot  be greatly  manipulated through waitlists. Also how are you so sure that Hopkins does not engage in student profile refinement as you call it? Every schools does that, but still this can only go so far. You cannot predict what choices an RD applicant will have and you cannot predict which applicants will for sure choose your school of admitted. Chicago’s yield has increased because it has managed to maintain a top 10 USNews spot for quite some time now, it is generally high ranked, and has revamped its undergrad to attract a wider audience. Still Chicago is a more niche place relative to the ivies so it tends to be a bit more self-selected.  RD yield is not at all as easily manipulated as you make it to be.
Why is Parchment garbage? It is not 100% accurate but they jut track revealed preference. there are no 100% accurate verifiable sources for these sort of things anyway.
The difference is RD yield between Hopkins and Cornell/Brown, the other Ivies is not due to the fact that these schools have some amazing yield protection techniques that somehow Hopkins doesn’t use.

re#29, so at Cornell it should be easier to get the needed grades, if your fellow students in curved pre-med classes are dumber. Thereby making it the best choice.

@stevensPR  Oh but yes I am looking at that tab. Only thing is that you cannot simply add the math +verbal when given as separate ranges. this is why i rote down verbal and math separately  (I guess i paid attention to my stat class at Wharton after all…)
As I said before Cornell has a few schools that attract people with  in general lower SATs. If you took just the liberal arts, business and engineering students (leave out agriculture, hotel etc) then there would not be much of difference.
Besides, these differences in scores do not show a difference in academic accomplishment. any of these schools could have an entire class with perfect or new perfect scores.  Just means they are willing to admit non-traditional student that have something special but not top scores.
Example: Yale and Chicago have higher scores than Stanford. Does this mean that they admit more accomplished students? of course not. It is just that they focus is slightly different.

@penn95, there is a statistical difference between the following:
Cornell 25th percentiles vs Hopkins for Verbal: 650 Verbal vs 700.
Cornell 25th percentiles vs Hopkins for Verbal: 680 vs 720
Keep in mind those are enrolled stats, you’d see similar or greater disparities for the admitted students
ACT: 32 to 35 for Hopkins.  Cornell: 31 to 34.
Maybe you weren’t awake during your stats class.
As for Yale and Chicago versus Stanford:  Did you also forget that Stanford admits DI athletes?

@penn95 And here you go, since you can’t seem to do the research yourself
https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/admissions/undergraduate/firstyear/class_profiles.cfm
Cornell engineering with higher scores than the other colleges within Cornell has an admit profile roughly equal to that of Hopkins’ enrolled profile (which includes the lower scoring Arts and Sciences division within Hopkins in addition to engineering).

@stevensPR The small difference could very well be explained by Dartmouth’s stronger athletics, strong legacy tradition and the fact that it is probably be more willing to accept very unique candidates with something special but not super high scores. Such an applicant is more likely to apply/attend at an ivy+ school than Hopkins.
yet it still doesn’t mean that somehow Hopkins students are more academically accomplished.

@stevensPR Superior athletics and stronger legacy ties are facts not conjecture. As is the fact that unique applicants tend to flock more to ivy+ schools. Besides  what are your facts?  that 10-20 point differences in SAT scores make for a more academically accomplished student body? haha ok.
