I’d go with VT.  Normally VT and Penn St are pretty darn equal in caliber (albeit a general edge toward VT in most areas of engineering), but I’d wonder how the switch from the branch campus would go.  The better students from our high school (heading toward engineering) go straight to main campus.  I’m not sure if those who start at branch campuses end up doing fine or if not.  Those I know personally (who start at branch campuses) aren’t engineering majors.  Can Erie’s branch campus let you know how many start out vs finish?  (Then allow for the fact that there will be those who start and don’t finish at the Main Campus too, of course.)

Erie is excellent for engineering but…it’s not main campus. So it’d all depend on her/your certainty wrt small classes with little weedout (thanks to honors) but at a small campus (I think it’s 4,000 students and not all live on campus) requiring the move to a larger campus after 2 years, or 4 years in the same place, with all the on campus life it entails but also the increased competition. However my gut feeling would be to go for VT, so that she can have the “full college experience”.
Do ask VT what sort of support they have for women in engineering: WISE? Living learning communities? Special adviser within engineering?

For engineering?  You ought to find a different crowd to consult with.  Powerhouses in engineering are often different than powerhouses for other majors.  Doing a quick google search and just looking on the search page it appears they’re ranked #13.  ASU is #38.  PSU is #24.  Individual departments have their own ranking so one should look at what they are interested in if rankings matter.  As with anything else, different schools have a more directed engineering focus.
Overall though, in engineering circles, yes, VT is considered an academic powerhouse.  H has had headhunters after him pretty much his whole engineering career and even when doing projects on other continents, his VT degree was respected (since many of those folks cared about the name on his diploma as well as projects he’d already done).

A lot of the college admission percentages are misleading because they don’t account specific majors that may have higher admission criteria.  It’s just a percentage of total addimision. Penn State is another one.  They’ve admitted students this current admission cycle to the main University Park campus with substantially lower stats than a lot of business and engineering pre-majors with higher stats. Instead, PSU pushed those kids off to branch campuses.  And the expection is that if you want to attend, don’t count on any aid.

https://ncees.org/licensure/number-licensees-state/ says that there are about 820,000 licensed Professional Engineers.  Somehow, it seems doubtful that 164,000 of them are VT graduates (164,000 is about 98 years worth of VT engineering graduates, based on 1666 per year according to http://profiles.asee.org/profiles/8059/screen/21?school_name=Virginia+Polytechnic+Institute+and+State+University – and many engineering graduates outside of civil engineering do not seek PE licensing).
Now, if you are referring to all engineering graduates working in engineering jobs (whether or not with PE license), the number is even larger.

@ucbalumnus  That is exactly the thought that came to my mind without the actual numbers.  Seems rather impossible any way one looks at it even if one assumes a reasonable number of those 820K came from abroad.  I like my alma mater and I know several successful graduates from it engineering and otherwise, but methinks that statement (whether PE or pe) is hogwash.  I’m very curious as to what they’re basing it on, but not curious enough to ask TBH.  If someone else did, I’d love to read the answer though - or see the statement taken down.  False facts is one of my pet peeves no matter who says it.

My daughter was accepted to Cornell, RPI, Case Western, Northeastern, Clemson, Stevens, Rutgers and Rowan in-state, all for engineering. She had a range from no aid to very good merit. We really, really struggled with the decision, but it came down to Cornell, ranked #11 for engineering, and VT, ranked #14.
Cornell was too expensive for us, and the other schools just didn’t measure up. She cried for 24 hours, then she was over it.
She is finishing up her freshman year. She made Deans list last semester (no worries about getting her first choice major) She lives in the engineering housing (Lee Hall, Hypatia  for women, Galileo for men) which has probably made a difference- everyone is taking the same classes and so they all have to study at the same times, no pressure to party when you should study.
My favorite part? Everyone seems so happy to be there. When we were wandering around campus trying to come to terms with turning down “an Ivy” , kids would literally just start talking to us. “Would your daughter like to see my dorm room? I live in Lee Hall” or telling us about their plans for graduate school, how their classes went, what they thought about work-life balance. Literally random girls we met while petting their dogs. Tons of cute dogs.
The parents we met at restaurants were nice, and many were alums. They showed us photos of their kids, they asked us to let them know what she decided. Every single person we met was so great. There were NINE rainbows on our drive home. It was just so great. It IS so great.
My friend is a CEO of a tech company in the research triangle. She says “some of the best engineers I hire are VT grads”
I’m sorry, I am a little biased, but, really, it’s the whole package. Rutgers is basically a commuter campus. I don’t know much about PSU engineering.

My daughter is home for Spring break. She says her physics and chem classes were 200 people lectures, math classes 20-50 people, as are most other classes. Engineering was smaller first semester, around 30, now it’s about 50-60. They split up into working groups of 6 people in engineering. There is a one credit course you take if you are in Hypatia that’s a little GPA boost, it is mentoring and career events and 10 hours of community service which was honestly kind of fun for her at the beginning when she didn’t have a lot going on socially.
My daughters advice is that if you want better housing or a more social environment, pick O’Shaug or Peddrew-Yates. Pritchard is social but not nicer than Lee. But if you are concerned about work environment for freshman year, the engineering community helps for environmental reasons - no crowds wandering the halls when you are trying to study for a chem test - because they all have the same test. GPAs are higher for engineers in the engineering LLC.

Assuming living on campus, mechanical engineering major, PSU Erie is $37,860 for out-of-state, while PSU Main is $48,268.  See https://cce.ais.psu.edu/tuition-calculator-ui/#!/ .
Yes, you can complete a bachelor’s degree in EE, IE, or ME at PSU Erie, according to http://main.abet.org/aps/AccreditedProgramsDetails.aspx?OrganizationID=55&ProgramIDs= .  However, the price is rather expensive if the intention is to transfer to PSU Main, using PSU Erie like a community college.

Assuming living on campus, mechanical engineering major, PSU Erie is $37,860 for out-of-state, while PSU Main is $48,268.  See https://cce.ais.psu.edu/tuition-calculator-ui/#!/ .
Yes, you can complete a bachelor’s degree in EE, IE, or ME at PSU Erie, according to http://main.abet.org/aps/AccreditedProgramsDetails.aspx?OrganizationID=55&ProgramIDs= .  However, the price is rather expensive if the intention is to transfer to PSU Main, using PSU Erie like a community college.

Tuition also increases @airway1 at PSU after a certain amount of credits are reached - going from sophomore to junior year.

@ucbalumnus what I mean by “Rutgers is basically a commuter campus” is that there really isn’t a campus feeling. It is several campuses spread all over New Brunswick and Piscataway, and there are so many students who live nearby that the campus empties out every weekend. They go home. I live 45 minutes away, and even the kids who do live on campus freshman year usually move back home sophomore year because there just isn’t a lot going on.
You can only tell so much by reading about it. Sometimes you have to experience it. I took classes post grad for a couple of years. Excellent instructors, well-respected program. But it could be lonely for an OOS student, and, well…go HOKIES!

@Gudmom I feel the same about Rutgers. We live even closer…15 miles and if my son decides to attend, I’d want him on campus. However, my biggest fear is that it will be deserted on weekends, he won’t have that true ‘college’ experience, and as he puts it, he’ll feel like it’s an extension of high school. In two weeks we are having second looks at some other schools he had been accepted at and hope he sees the benefits of those programs as well.

Why in the world would you send your kid out of state and spend thousands more rather than going to Rutgers,tcnj, or  Rowan??? Because Rutgers is a commuter school? Why would that have a bearing on where to go? Wish I had that money to burn

I get the issues with Rutgers lousy campus and buses, but in sheer cost/value vs private or out of state public schools—TCNJ and Rowan engineering for instate students are unbeatable now. Just take a look at their student outcomes—- high retention rates after freshman year, newer state of the art facilities —- near 100% employment or grad school after graduation plus average starting salarys for each engineering discipline in the high 60k’s to over 70k for computer and electrical engineering. Contrast that with out of state public school costs or what I call the “Stevens Dilemma” where a school like Stevens gives huge scholarship discounts to freshmen who fail to pull a 3.0 and thereafter lose that mo ru.

Also consider the smaller pedestrian campuses of tcnj and Rowan where everything is a short walk away rather than Rutgers or PennState for instance. A smaller more manageable campus is a huge benefit to engineering students whose time is better spent studying and having some free time to relax as opposed to riding buses and essentially having to commute to class from your dorm a la Rutgers or Penn State

In some cases those OOS schools are providing better scholarship money that makes Rutgers more expensive as an instate student. Rutgers didn’t give a dime of aid to us. I understand what my son means by having a feeling that Rutgers would be ‘an extension of high school’. That came from him, not me. I grew up near SUNY Stony Brook and was strongly advised by my HS guidance counselor to look at other schools outside the area upstate public and private. For me, it was the best move. Everyone is different. But when a school shows interest and is offering significant aid, how Do you not look further into it.

@njdadjets - From what personal experience do you claim a “Stevens dilemma”? What dilemma? Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale’s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being “inexpensive” for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend.
In the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers).
Many scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.

Not sure why that would be a Stevens-specific issue.  Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).  But if the GPA minimum is something like 3.5, that can be more of an issue, since students have to protect their GPAs like pre-meds do.

It isn’t an issue specific to any particular institution. As previously discussed, many scholarships (if not most) at many schools mandate that the recipient maintain a minimum GPA. Frequently, those conditions are imposed by the benefactor or funder of the scholarship. If the minimum GPA is not maintained, many will reduce or withdraw the scholarship. That is quite a common condition. The vast majority I am certain will state this or any other conditions that must be satisfied up front, and in those cases the student is made aware of his/her responsibilities up front. In my experience most schools are not in the business of “bait and switch”.
