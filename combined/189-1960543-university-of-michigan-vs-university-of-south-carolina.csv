Good luck to you…Oh one more thing. At UM you might be a small fish in a big frozen pond, but at USC, you might end up being a big fish in a small warm pond and closer to the beautiful city of Charleston and the beaches…

Clearly you can do well from either place. As parents posting on this site, we typically take the perspective of wanting the best for our kids. Objectively, that would lean heavily towards UM. That said, there is nothing objective about the college admissions process. So much of it comes down to not best, but rather, best for you. Only you can determine that. We look at rankings, history, reputation, etc. and it seems like a slam dunk. We, however, haven’t walked in your shoes. You need to decide what feels better. I’m sure you’ll consider all relevant data and make a great choice. Good luck and all the best!

From a pure opportunity standpoint, it’s not even close.  U of Michigan is a top ranked university and Ross is one of the top ranked undergrad business programs in the U.S.  U of South Carolina is way, way down the food chain.  It is risky to go to a school that is middle of the road but had a single well ranked program.  Even more risky is to go to a school that you won’t be happy at and a culture in which you won’t thrive.  And only you can make that choice.

I think you have a solid plan, wait for the final word on admission to the honors college at USC and to Ross. You can then evaluate the total difference in price. Keep in mind that going away also has some downsides- you won’t be able to go home for the weekend if you need to de-stress from your crazy roommate or if you are sick, travel is a lot more expensive (you’ll probably fly for Thanksgiving break, at least), and you’ll miss family events. Also consider the following:
Is your OOS scholarship guaranteed? Do you have to maintain a certain GPA? What if you need a 5th year?
What is the cost of study abroad? Do you pay your current tuition or some different amount? What are the reciprocal schools?
If you change your mind and switch majors, what is the effect on cost, graduation, etc.?
What are the most common firms hiring from the program, starting salary, etc. etc. ?

And while UMich may be close to home, see if you can do study-abroad to get away for a few semesters.
Remember that this is a 40 year decision, not a 4 year decision (yes, after you graduate, few people will care where you went . . . except for alumni and the friends you made, but that may matter).

@brantly’s point is equally true for USC.  If you have not been accepted into the HC, then you have not been accepted as pre-IB. (You aren’t even accepted directly into IB.  I think if your GPA drops below a 3.5, IB as a jr is no longer an option.) The IB program is incredibly competitive.  If you aren’t admitted as an incoming freshman, the admissions is fierce and requires a minimum of a 3.6 or 3.7 to even apply.  (I can’t remember exactly.  I sat in on a presentation last yr and the details are fuzzy.  Since it didn’t apply to my dd, it wasn’t a focus.)
To give you an idea, my dd is a Top Scholar who was accepted into pre-IB bc of the HC admissions.  She is also part of one of their cohort students.  She only has until Feb of this yr (freshman) to decide if she wants to stay in the cohort or switch to classic IB.  If she changes her mind March or later that she doesn’t want to be in her cohort, she completely loses her IB spot.

Clearly you really want to go to USC but worry that your wish to leave Michigan will lead you to a wrong decision.
What if you went to USC and decided you made a mistake (or didn’t get into IB), would you be able to 1) afford UMich 2) get into Ross?
(I think the reverse isn’t possible, since you wouldn’t have your merit scholarship from USC anymore).

Congratulations to you… Agonizing for sure. But by the end of the day its where you wanted to be and that makes it the right choice. I was one of the earliest posters and keep in mind all the good things I said
“The University of South Carolina Darla Moore International School of Business is rated number one by all accounts. It is NOT an easy school to get into. Having said that, my best friend son graduated from this school last year. He did an internship at Google in Ann Arbor (yes Google is in Ann Arbor) and was offered employment once he graduated. He was super driven and he did a few abroad studies in Spain, Denmark, and I believe even in Brazil. The school IB department is fabulous and competitive. Having said that, his only REGRET was that he did not go to a higher ranked or overall better named school . The overall Business School is good but not like the IB department and not as selective. At the time he was applying to colleges,USC was the most affordable option and that is where he ended up going. He knows that the fact that he graduated for USC did NOT affect internship or job opportunities. He has done quite well for a 23 year old.”

I see you have decided, but I do have a comment.  I grew up 30 minutes from Ann Arbor, was a 3rd generation Wolverine, and went to Michigan & Ross.  It felt like a different world, honestly.  I spent time with bright (some brilliant) students and profs from all over the country, and in some cases all over the world.  I was immersed in coursework and opportunities that were nothing like my HS life.  Ann Arbor is a great town to live in the middle of.  My parents tried to give me space, never dropped in unannounced.  I saw HS friends sometimes on campus, but wasn’t obligated to spend time with them if I didn’t want to.
Once I was out of college, the Michigan name opened doors for me, too.  I am in a business where my resume gets reviewed a lot, and I often get, “Michigan —that’s a good school” comments when they get to that part of my resume.
You can move elsewhere after undergrad.  And a Michigan degree makes that easier.
I didn’t love everything about my experience there, but that is more that I might have thrived most at a smaller school.  But I would pick Michigan over South Carolina every single time.  It is silly to pay OOS tuition in this case.  Don’t be put off by it being close to home — it is a whole different thing to be a student on campus than to live nearby.

@pmcdoug Congrats on your Decison! It takes courage at your young age to stand by your conviction and decline acceptance to Ross when overwhelmingly everyone in your life advises you to go to Michigan Ross. While it’s important to get input from close family and trusted friends, even advice from college gurus here on CC, at the end of the day you have to do your own research and trust your own instincts and make these type of executive decisions for yourself because this is your life! Some of the most successful people in life have made decisions that went against the grain of common opinion and defied expectation. As many other folks on CC have stated before me, your success in life will be determined by you, not the undergrad school you attend. There are millions of successful businessmen and women in the USA who did not attend Michigan and Michigan Ross. And I’m hoping one of those people will someday include my son who attends Ohio State Fisher. While the Michigan name on your resume may garner some “aha” moments from folks, such moments last for the first few seconds of an introduction and then don’t matter. What matters is your competence and intelligence, your knowledge and experience, your  initiative/efforts, your enthusiasm and determination. Best of luck!

It appears @pbmcdoug carefully weighed his options and made a thoughtful decision.  I’m sure he’ll be successful regardless of the school he attends.  @intparent There’s more to life than work, money and the ranking and prestige of your alma mater and success isn’t measured by the size of your paycheck or who your work for.  Quality of life matters and a college needs to be a good fit in addition to offering a high quality education.
There’s also a study by a Princeton economist found that the earnings of students from Ivies and students who were accepte at elite schools but chose to attend elsewhere were essentially the same.
""In 1999, economists from Princeton and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation looked at some of the same data Professor Eide and his colleagues had used, but crunched them in a different way: they compared students at more selective colleges to others of “seemingly comparable ability,” based on their SAT scores and class rank, who had attended less selective schools, either by choice or because a top college rejected them.
The earnings of graduates in the two groups were about the same — perhaps shifting the ledger in favor of the less expensive, less prestigious route. (The one exception was that children from “disadvantaged family backgrounds” appeared to earn more over time if they attended more selective colleges. The authors, Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger, do not speculate why, but conclude, “These students appear to benefit most from attending a more elite college.”)""
Congrats @pbmcdoug on making your decision.  Now you can enjoy the remainder of your senior year!

I’ve certainly recommended that students not always attend the highest ranked schools they get into.  In fact, both of my kids attended schools for fit that weren’t the highest ranked schools they got into.  But Ross is a pretty exceptional school for a BBA, with particularly good opportunities who want to study business.  In this case, I think you WOULD find that Ross graduates earn more if that is the criteria you want to use.  Also, I think the OP has honestly been looking for reasons to not stay close to home – and I think in this case, they are making a mistake.  But obviously they are free to make their own choice, and give that Ross spot up to someone else.

Just be honest with yourself.  If you want to choose a school because of campus, honors college, and overall vibe, that’s great.
Just remember that when it comes to recruiting opportunities, recruiters won’t give two figs about the campus or vibe and Ross (or other elite majors like CS at UIUC) will be seen as equivalent or superior to many honors colleges.
But yes, you don’t have to choose a school to maximum ROI or recruiting opportunities (though that is a uncommon tack for a b-school major, but I digress).
BTW, I’m speaking as a neutral.

What the findings of the study really say is that its the students that make the school, not the other way around. They have it in them to succeed which is why the elite schools accept them in the first place.  This kid has what it takes and there’s more than one path to a successful business career.  While rankings are useful they aren’t the be all end all.   Far too many “highly ranked” colleges game the rankings to attract more and more applicants which in turn makes them more selective.

The poster will among many bright students at South Carolina.
