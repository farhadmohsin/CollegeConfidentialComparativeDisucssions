If you view fraternities as a negative, then Dartmouth College may not be the school for you.

I don’t think there is a meaningful difference in the opportunity to party at Dartmouth vs. Amherst. Both have the opportunity to work hard/play hard – how much of each is up to the individual student. For what it is worth, a colleague gave a paper at Dartmouth recently and said that the Library was packed on a nice Friday afternoon – maybe students were getting the work done before the party hard, or maybe they were the work hard kids, but it seemed very intellectually engaged. In terms of culture, Amherst did have underground fraternities which have recently been banned, so Amherst is no stranger to the party scene. Amherst has worked hard to foster economic diversity.  Both have excellent soccer, at least on the Men’s side, which is what I’m familiar with. Dartmouth does have a Women’s Club team which – at the D1 level – is usually a very competitive program.  Amherst would have more of an intramural program. If you are interested in the possibility of trying out at either school as a walk-on player, contact the coach quickly to find out what, if any, opportunities there may be. On the D3 side, we’ve seen kids come to pre-season, and either make it or not.
It sounds like you somewhat prefer the scene at Dartmouth – if the money works out, they are both superb, so pick the one that feels more comfortable to you.

Have you compared - since you are high need - funding for unpaid summer internships and research and study abroad and things like that? I know Amherst has tons of funding for these things (and help with the initial dorm stuff, coat, etc too), not sure about Dartmouth.
Career center at Amherst is very strong also, lots of programs, speakers, workshops etc.
I’m sure you know engineering is out if you choose Amherst. CS or whatever else. Easy double major too, if you like, with no required distribution courses.

I don’t think the transfer to Thayer is automatically guaranteed for outside students in their 2-1-1-1 plan. Something to look in to.

When I had said work hard, play hard for Dartmouth, I did not mean clean playing as in sports but alcohol and beer pong. You are 15 years old turning 16. Another con for Dartmouth is the isolation especially in winter. Amherst has plenty of great outdoors also. No shortage of pretty scenery.

Colloquially in the US
“play hard” in “work hard/play hard” is a way of saying “as serious about getting very drunk/high as about getting high grades, where getting drunk is a social activity appreciated by all including excellent students”
15-16 year olds don’t characterize themselves as “work hard/play hard” in the US as this implies regular drunkenness.
(End of us colloquialism lesson:) )

I’m not understanding the phrase, “I’ve met more Africans there [meaning, Dartmouth]” , if you’ve never visited? I’d be very careful about drawing conclusions about student culture, interaction, and “seeming cool” based solely on what you’ve seen on paper. I’ve met several African-American alumni from Dartmouth who will probably never contribute a dime to their annual fund because they were so disenchanted by their experience there. Your mileage may vary (YMMV), as they say on the net, but, the question of whether you have visited any of these schools needs to be cleared up.

About age. 15 turning 16 or 16 turning 17 is another colloquialism. Sorry about that. It means that you will soon be having your birthday. You are not 16 turning 17 because you had your birthday at the end of last year. In mid December you were 15 and worried about the impact of age.

@circuitrider, yep, you’re right. The administration took action to curb dangerous drinking at Dartmouth–and I think the experiment is still too young to know how successful it’s been. My understanding is that the reaction has been very mixed on campus. But you’re seriously deriding an effort to do something about the issue of excessive underage drinking, something that exists on just about every campus in America?
As for the Review, it offers a hard-right perspective that’s always represented a fraction of the student body and is held in contempt by the majority. That’s been the case since it first formed in the early 80s, and certainly Dartmouth’s student population has become decidedly more liberal since then. The D takes much more traditionally liberal positions. I happen to think publications with alternative viewpoints–across the political spectrum–are a good thing, but I object to the times that the Review has crossed the line over the years.
Once again, unless current students of color want to weigh in on the merits of Dartmouth vs Amherst, there’s little point of continuing this back and forth. And frankly, it’s not particularly germane to what the OP asked. Are there any current CS students or recent grads who can add to the discussion?

@TTdd16, only current students of color can weigh in on issues at the schools? Most students have interactions with a very diverse community of students and their opinions are  insightful as well. My kid is an Amherst grad of color,and I have shared very positive things via PM with  @gigichuck.

@privatebanker I hear you. I loved the Lord Jeff- Mammoth selection and transition process though, D was there through it. Very democratic, current students and alumni got a vote, the list of finalists came from a student generated list. For a year they knew LJ was out but the new one wasn’t in, there were even humorous cups and shirts printed for that, with a big “?”

“The OP has two amazing choices, and I’m sure she’ll do well wherever she decides. She really needs current students from both colleges to weigh in on the specifics she asked about.”
@CottonTales, I wasn’t the one who brought up this issue. Another poster, without any direct connection to Dartmouth, did. But if @gigichuck has concerns about the environment for persons of color at Dartmouth, perhaps they’d be the best ones to reach out to her to share their experiences (as your kid did about Amherst.) And of course hearing from other current students about the specific issues in her original post would be helpful.

Computer Science is indeed very strong at Dartmouth.  The computer language BASIC as well as the first computer time-sharing system were invented there by two Dartmouth professors,  One of the professors, John Kemeny, later went on to become the president of Dartmouth College.  And the college carries on this strong tradition of CS to this day.

^Current students are preferable, of course. But, let’s face it, if we depended on them entirely, this thread would have died on the vine a long time ago. Nor would it be an issue if every post were full of high praises. Posters with glancing references to friends, or to colleagues they’ve met from the colleges in question or to trips they’ve made in passing the campuses, only get knocked when they say something negative. ~O)
