Maryland is a respectable enough school that it is impossible to ignore that price difference. It even has famous alumni, including a founder of a big well known computer company.

UMCP is a solid school as far as CS and ECE are concerned. If he wants to consider CS - cool things are happening with a new building (because of a 31 million dollar gift from an alumnus).
I know high GPA students from UMCP get into absolutely top grad schools (I know of one who went to Stanford for CS PhD, and then spent sometime on faculty of Harvard!). Sergey Brin himself went from CS undergrad to Stanford’s PhD program.

Among grad schools, the only one I see being hard to access from a good (but not top 3-5) state school are the MBA programs. Feeder school data from M7 business schools suggests as such. High GPA and research experience at UMCP --&gt; pretty good  for PhD programs in computer engineering. I don’t think law schools place that much emphasis on undergrad school, though I am not particularly knowledgeable in this area.
If he wants to go for a PhD program in computer engineering, money won’t be an issue … if a school wants you, it will pay for you to attend. Law and business schools are a different matter.
I can see that it is a hard decision. In any case, congratulations to your son on his accomplishments and being in position!

Decades ago, many state flagships (probably including Maryland) were not as selective as they are now.  Because engineering curricula were and are rigorous, the washout rate was high back then as many less prepared students decided it was too hard.
But a strong student of the type to earn a full ride merit scholarship is likely to be one who can handle the rigor of an engineering curriculum.

Be careful about assuming that AP credit will make it easy to graduate two semesters early. Check how they apply to subject requirements, not just number of credits.
Also, does he want to have to graduate early, versus being able to take more in or out of major electives?
Also, do not count on getting a UGSI job at UCB for CS 61A as a sophomore. Preference for such jobs goes to juniors and seniors by semesters attended, among other requirements. https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/gsis/prospective/ugsi

It may look like he can graduate in three years, but it’s HIGHLY unlikely. Even if he walks in with 25, 30, even 40% of the total credit volume, he’ll have to take certain classes in strict sequence, and some of them will only be offered during specific terms that might not align with his progress.
My son started with quite a few meaningful hours in mechanical engineering. He tested into Calc III, Physics II, and completely out of Chem and several GEs. He printed his curriculum sheet and traced through all of the prerequisites from senior project, backwards through his entire curriculum, to plot the most efficient path. There was no way to cut it below 4 years. He took a couple of light quarters (12 hours) and still only had 15 of 45 quarter hours left his senior year. The problem was, half of them were senior project. He decided to use his time taking graduate classes and will walk with a BS/MS in about 4.5 years.
What ends up happening in an engineering curriculum is that a lot of the GE hours go unused.

I’m a huge fan of Cal. (Alma mater.) I really think it’s one of the most exciting schools/areas you could pick to go to school. I have family members that recently graduated from Cal and had no problem doing it in 4 years. (One was able to graduate a semester early, in fact.)
That said, given the choice between Cal and CMU at a similar price point, I totally see CMU as a rational option.  CMU is a renowned science and tech school that would offer a more personal, personalized education and  likely easier access to faculty and research. Cal is notorious for its bureaucracy and minimal customer service, something frankly you should expect when paying over $50K per year.

I’m a huge fan of Cal. (Alma mater.) I really think it’s one of the most exciting schools/areas you could pick to go to school. I have family members that recently graduated from Cal and had no problem doing it in 4 years. (One was able to graduate a semester early, in fact.)
That said, given the choice between Cal and CMU at a similar price point, I totally see CMU as a rational option.  CMU is a renowned science and tech school that would offer a more personal, personalized education and  likely easier access to faculty and research. Cal is notorious for its bureaucracy and minimal customer service, something frankly you should expect when paying over $50K per year.

Looks like they let the L&S CS major expand to 550 students per year (despite the minimum 3.3 college GPA in the prerequisites for L&S undeclared students to enter the major), to go along with the 300-400 in EECS (which is tightly regulated at the frosh and transfer admission levels).  L&S CS appears to be the second largest major on the UCB campus (economics is larger), a very different situation from the early-to-mid 2000s when the number of students was under 100 per year in the wake of the tech bubble crash.
According to the class schedule, the upper division courses with over 600 students appear to be CS 170 (algorithms) and CS 188 (artificial intelligence).  On the other hand, there does not seem to be much interest in the EE side of EECS, since the upper division EE courses have enrollments under 30.

CMU is not for everyone   Fit is very important there.  Can’t imagine that it is so “renowned” for engineering that it is worth a major premium over UMD.  There are smart kids at every engineering school. He would have no shortage of very smart peers at UMD.

Look at the online class schedule for each school if you want to see class sizes.
http://www.berkeleytime.com has grade distributions by course for UCB. Don’t know if CMU has anything similar. http://www.ourumd.com/ has grade distributions for Maryland. Presumably this is desired because of law school intentions?
“Research assistant” commonly means a PhD student being paid a stipend and tuition waiver for some research assistant work. So if one is leading a discussion or recitation section of a class, that is functionally like what is ordinarily called a teaching assistant or graduate student instructor.

$270,000 vs. free. That’s a CMU education or a UMD education and $3,000,000 when he turns 58. That’s the true difference when you consider the opportunity cost of the money ($270,000 at 6% annually for 40 years). Alternatively, it’s $1,500,000 at age 48. It would be a nice bridge between an early retirement and his fully funded 401k at 59.5.
He might get a slightly better experience at CMU, maybe even a superior experience. What he won’t get though is an experience that’s even remotely close to $270,000 more valuable financially. You all have to decide if you are flush enough to provide that as a gift simply based on the experience.
It’s unfortunately too late for this option now for you, but we had a plan for just this case. Not believing ANY undergraduate degree from ANY school is worth a quarter of a million dollars, we simply told our son that any program that netted out over $200k was off the table. The only schools he applied to, in addition to meeting all the requirements that he wanted out of a school, were schools that had reputations of granting good merit aid to high stats students.
Tough choice, but the financial implications are real.

Agree with above: CMU &gt; Cal… but free UMD totally trumps CMU.
The fact is, he’ll take pretty much the same classes at UMD and be competitive for many of the same internships as CMU. And a year or two after graduation most employers won’t care where he went to school, but rather what he accomplished at his last job.
You can sweeten the idea of UMD by promising your son a great trip to Europe. (Even after paying for it, you’ll have saved a fortune over CMU.)

UMD is ABET accredited and I’m sure recruiting is good there. That is what is very important at the undergraduate level in engineering.    UMD is a well respected school. There will be very many motivated,  top students there in the engineering program. The family needs to decide for themselves though  if the sustantial cost  is worth it to go elsewhere.

Another reason to keep costs down: a student who does not have immediate financial pressure is not forced into making career and life choices based on short term financial concerns, but instead can choose to prioritize longer term career development. See the posts below:
