If Duke is more expensive then go to UCB.
Your parents will thank you for saving them big $$  AND you will have more access to jobs in Calif when you graduate.
to me its a no brainer.

At Duke, you may have an easier time getting into interesting courses that aren’t in your major, which would lead to a well-rounded education. You’re absolutely right about the importance of a general education. I’m speaking as a strong supporter of a liberal arts education, though, and not everyone shares my view.
Cal is notably stronger in the field you want to study, so if you are certain CS is it for you, it may be better to go there. Even full pay parents love a bargain, and will thank you for saving them money!

How do finances play into this? Unless money is not a consideration or Duke gives you enough assistance to bring it to Berkeley’s level, this should certainly figure into your equation.
The other things you need to consider is how certain you want to pursue engineering/CS and how much you want the type of college experience that a school like Duke can provide. They are both great schools, but if you are looking for that quintessential college experience (school spirit, sports, Greek life) and want a strong liberal arts curriculum, Duke is probably a better choice.

You also have to live there and enjoy the people around you. Your education also includes the experiences and people you meet outside of the classroom and labs. Consider the climates of both schools into your equation as well. It’s more of a multi variate regression analaysis than 1 plus 1 equals 2. It’s not a slam dunk  in my estimation.

My daughter was admitted to UC Berkeley and Duke.  She chose Duke and is currently a freshman.  She is definitely not an engineer type, more of a liberal arts student (although may consider Law or MBA down the road).  It was an easy decision for her.
Duke doesn’t have a business undergraduate major/minor.  So keep that in mind.  They do have an MMS certificate (you can research that).
If you want to pursue CS and work in Silicon Valley, I’d say go to Berkeley without a doubt.  As you know, Berkeley is known for its CS program.  Duke’s engineering programs are quite rigorous though.  It will be a challenging program.  [Did you know the Duke’s Biomedical Engineering program is a top 4 program in the nation?]  The Duke brand name will be good if you decide on medicine or business grad school.  Duke pre-med students have a high success rate at getting into medical school (something like 90% of students).
My daughter loves Duke.  She attended most basketball games this year.  Did tenting for the UNC game.  Great school spirit.  She did get tired of taking the bus to/from East/West campus.  She already has a dorm assignment for Sophomore year.  Close to West Union.  Most of her Fall, 2018 classes start at noon.  She is a night owl, so she’s in heaven.
Duke has a lot of Asian students, but more diversity than Berkeley.  There is a social hierarchy on campus - but this is over-blown and only becomes an issue if you let it bother you.  My daughter joined a sorority but only attends certain events - mainly ones that don’t involve alcohol.  She isn’t a party animal.  She joined a few organizations that she really likes and plans to continue with them next school year.
Good luck with your decision!

To put things in perspective, 56 VC investment partners did their undergrad at Berkeley while 32 went to Duke. Since Berkeley is roughly 5 times the size of Duke (and its student body is less academically diverse), Duke appears to be outperforming Berkeley handily on a per capita basis. This is just one metric but the point is that overall output should not be conflated with quality.

It looks like many of the things you’ve heard about Berkeley are simply, myths.
The EECS at Berkeley is NOT cutthroat. Far from it. EECS students are used to do team-working. It’s a highly collaborative environment where everyone is helping each other out.
The College of Engineering students rarely complain, if at all they do, about the lack of resources dedicated to undergrad students. It’s also not true advising is lacking. You’ll get plenty of it there.
And, Berkeley being less diverse than Duke? Really? That’s new to me. I’ve been to many top-ranked schools and I have yet to see a school with a more diverse student body than Berkeley’s.
I have no idea how Duke takes care of its students. But Berkeley COE environment is top-class.

This is another myth. Can you show us any data to support this? Only 8% get into the College of Engineering, less than 8% in the College of Chemistry. And, less than 6% get onto EECS. I would love to see any data that would show Duke’s student body is more intellectual than Berkeley College of Engineering student body.

I didn’t suggest either student body has an intellectual edge.  I am saying that in the real world most people focus on the broader and household name rankings. In every one Duke has an indisputable and substantial edge.
I can observe that the disparity between a Duke and UCB engineering degree is much narrower then the broad difference by which Duke surpassses UCB in name recognition, brand respect etc based on the aforementioned rankings.  Consequently, the 17/18 year old OP should be confident that the post college adult doesn’t want to pursue a career outside of engineering.  Again both great schools but Duke clearly is a safer long term option in my opinion.

You can’t compare a giant state school to an elite private university. The best students at Berkeley are on par with the best students anywhere but there is much more variability at the bottom of the class. This is the price state schools pay for ensuring access to a great education. Berkeley’s mission is very different from Duke’s mission.
Also, Duke has almost twice as many Rhodes scholars as Berkeley (despite being a fraction of the size). Not bad for a “party school”.

Make sure you check out the surrounding areas around Duke University.  A colleague of mine was a UC Berkeley grad about 25+ years ago and was in the PhD program at Duke.  He never felt comfortable with the surrounding areas.  He said at that time, there were quite a few hillbillies around the Duke campus area and felt uneasy. Eventually, he dropped out of the PhD program.  But that was 25+ years ago and maybe things have changed since then.

I was just there on a tour.  Immediate surroundings were great.  Amazing food on 9th street near east campus and known as a culinary incubator.  Lots of creative chefs taking advantage of the research triangle.  The city of Durham also had some great food ranging from tapas to oven gourmet pizza.  Also home to the Durham Bulls.
The good news is with 6,000 kids on 8,000 plus acres of campus there is plenty of room for Duke students to spread out.  By comparison UCB has 29,000 undergrads on 1,232 acres.
Lastly I was in Oakland 25 years ago and felt very unsafe.  Has it changed and how did the riots several months ago effect the students experience.  Just asking.

The good news is with 6,000 kids on 8,000 plus acres of campus there is plenty of room for Duke students to spread out.  By comparison UCB has 29,000 undergrads on 1,232 acres.
Lastly I was in Oakland 25 years ago and felt very unsafe.  Has it changed and how did the riots several months ago effect the students experience.  Just asking.

Crime generally was much higher in the US 25 years ago (close to the peak of the crime wave*) than it is now.
*That was probably caused by leaded gasoline and which we are still paying for (criminals in expensive prison, etc.).

@JenniferClint : Duke is a good school. It’s engineering program is decent. A Duke engineering degree will open doors for you. But Berkeley is in a whole different league. Berkeley competes only with two other great schools in this regard – Stanford and MIT. Duke, sad to say, just isn’t in their league yet. So, let’s not try to confuse people on here and letting them believe Duke engineering degree carries much more clout and prestige than a Berkeley engineering degree. It is a complete reverse.

Duke is a target school for every major USIB I am not aware of UCB being a target of any major.

@Nocreativity1 : My point was – you’re not going to put yourself in a disadvantage position if you go to Berkeley instead of Duke, if you want to break into banking, or the financial industry, in general.
Now, the OP didn’t say he’s interested in banking. In fact, he clearly stated that he applied to, and got accepted onto, the engineering programs at both schools. Meaning to say, he’s interested in acquiring an engineering degree. If later he decides to head to banking/finance, both schools can serve him that well, as records have shown it. But, what if he decides to stick to the engineering field, or become a startup founder or wants to work in SV? Will attending Duke be better of for him in any of those regard? I don’t think so. In fact, I would politely argue that he will be putting himself in a disadvantage position given that that industry highly favors Cali schools, and Berkeley isn’t only a highly favored school in SV, but is also positioned in the heart of the Bay Area, the center of where the action in the tech industry is.

@nollagam Duke doesn’t have an undergraduate business school… (the P&Q ranking is only looking at undergraduate business schools)

But Duke is NOT Harvard. I’m sorry; but you are only deluding yourself if you’re thinking Duke = Harvard.
For school prestige and brand name recognition, Berkeley is much more closer to Harvard than Duke is to Harvard. Perhaps some students may be choosing private schools over Berkeley because they prefer the system – how almost everything is being handed out to them rather than them making an effort to get those same things. But that doesn’t have any bearing to school prestige, particularly in this case, and specially for engineering. The data I showed are full-proofs and true testaments to my arguments.
Duke may be able to offer a more caring environment with the kind of personal attention it gives to its students, but it doesn’t mean it’s automatically more prestigious. If we have to go by that logic, then it would appear all the LACs are more prestigious than Duke. But I don’t think there’s any LAC out there I can honestly consider to be more prestigious than Duke. So, that logic fails.
For many, many aspiring engineers, yes, they would rather have Berkeley (than Duke) behind their names. As a matter of fact, for those people, Duke is almost non-existent on their radar.

The Rhodes is an award that is (arguably) more relevant to undergraduates.
We’ve already established that global rankings can be pretty misleading. Refer to previous posts about Iowa, BU, and Minnesota being ranked over Dartmouth, Brown and Vanderbilt.
Berkeley is not in the same class as elite private universities when it comes to the overall quality of the student body. That is just a fact (look at the standardized test scores). I’m not trying to say that the best students are Berkeley are not excellent. The quality is just less uniform.
Also, as the UC system is becoming very reliant on international students who pay significantly more than in-state students. Many of these internationals are viewed as sources of funding. They do not necessarily have the credentials to be admitted to a school like Berkeley.
Duke is need-blind for all its applicants. That makes a tremendous difference.

Berkeley is not in the same class as elite private universities when it comes to the overall quality of the student body. That is just a fact (look at the standardized test scores). I’m not trying to say that the best students are Berkeley are not excellent. The quality is just less uniform.
Also, as the UC system is becoming very reliant on international students who pay significantly more than in-state students. Many of these internationals are viewed as sources of funding. They do not necessarily have the credentials to be admitted to a school like Berkeley.
Duke is need-blind for all its applicants. That makes a tremendous difference.

My student could see the potential in UCB. She got a Regents as an OOS student so got 4 year guaranteed housing, and priority registration. She wanted to attend UCB’s business school, and got in. Haas is ranked second by USNWR tied with MIT and only second to Wharton. She wanted to be near Silicon Valley for internships in entrepreneurship which she did, and she wanted to be on the West Coast and near San Francisco. Iowa and Dartmouth have nothing to do with it. But yeh, we’re proud she’s a golden bear, and not afraid to say it. Choose UCB. Lots of opportunities. Couldn’t find a finer UNDERGRAD experience.

@JenniferClint : That is why I didn’t like (and agree with) how Noncreativity1 presented a ranking where there’s only about a dozen or so schools which separate Berkeley from Duke. We could be nitpicking league tables just to win in an argument, when in fact, there is very little that separates between them, unlike in engineering where Berkeley is considered part of the “holy trinity”, standing alongside MIT and Stanford. And, for the record, I did not present those rankings to tell anyone on here that Berkeley is superior to Duke for banking/finance, but to disprove anyone who claims Berkeley would be a terrible training ground and feeder school to banking/finance.
I agree Duke is a fantastic school, as a whole. In the same way that I agree Yale, for instance, is an amazing school, in general. But those schools have weaknesses and engineering happens to be the worst of them. Coincidentally, engineering happens to be Berkeley’s one of its strongest departments, and Berkeley – its name – is highly reputable, not only in America but throughout the whole universe. Duke, though good as a whole, doesn’t enjoy such grandiose reputation as Berkeley’s, specially in the tech universe. In fact, for many, many serious and highly dedicated, extremely talented engineering aspirants, Duke is not on their radar.
If we’re talking about WS, I agree Duke has more presence there. But we’re not talking about WS, are we?

@JenniferClint : I think you needed to know that most, if not all, engineering students at Cal are not as gaga as Duke students are about winning Rhodes. What they care more about is how to become the next Elon Musk or how to become a successful startup founder, if not to work for those giant tech companies in the Bay Area and make six-figure salary (excluding bonus) as just entrants. That doesn’t make Berkeley engineering inferior to Duke simply because the school doesn’t have the same culture as Duke’s. And, btw, what is Oxford engineering compared to Berkeley’s!

This is pure ignorance. I’m sorry that I had to say that.
Here’s why.
Berkeley weighs HS GPAs more than it does standardized test scores, while Duke does the reverse. One can take SATs twice and submit the highest scores – we call that, super-scoring. Duke is notoriously known to have been employing that tactic.
Now, if you can show me any data that says Duke has a higher SAT score than Berkeley College of Engineering, I will concede.

1). Duke as a university tends to care very little about standardized test scores (look at Duke med, Fuqua, etc.) so claiming that Duke is “notorious” for doing that tells me that you are misinformed. Also, it would be prudent to refrain from making assertions that you cannot back up.
2). Standardized test scores are probably more informative than GPAs because they are STANDARDIZED.
3). Do you really think that Duke’s GPA range is lower than Berkeley’s? Seems highly improbable but I can’t find data on Duke’s GPA range.

The state share of costs per student dropped from $14,690 in 1996 to $7,160 in 2017, according to UC data.

Along with the elimination of financial aid for incoming out-of-state students, the university is increasing nonresident tuition by 8 percent in the next year and projecting to enroll an additional 1,200 nonresident undergraduates.
Out-of-state students make up a significant portion of students on the university’s flagship campus — roughly 35 percent of UC Berkeley’s incoming students were nonresidents in 2014.
