It looks like Psychology is their 4th largest major. Grad school shouldn’t be an issue but I would still ask them.

Many, many college students change their mind regarding their choice of major. It may be that she does as well, and that could change your outlook.
Will the cold weather on Ohio have a negative impact on her health?
It is a small college and she could get a bad case of “cabin fever” once  there, given that she currently lives in a large metropolitan area in Calif.
Will your financial situation change much if you move to Ohio? Do you currently own your home? If so the profits from the sale could impact her FA going forward. I dont like the idea of a one year “full ride”. Perhaps you could ask Kenyon to  sweeten the pot and increase her offer to cover 4 years ? In other words, a scholarship, rather than loans?
If I were you, If they can’t or wont’, given that you had planned on taking out loans anyway, I’d stay in SD.

hi there. i don’t know much (if anything) about ucsd, but i looked into kenyon quite a bit. kenyon offers psychology and neuroscience, and my admissions counselor explained an Off-Campus Activities Program in Psychology (OAPP) is offered which allows students to take advantage of its relationship with the James Cancer Hospital in Colombus to volunteer/pursue internships there. kenyon ends up placing students in very good graduate schools, so i would not worry about that.

I’m not specifically familiar with Psych programs so I could be wrong, but I generally thought that Masters programs are generally full pay, by the student, so not having loan debt would be ideal for a student pursing a Masters. On the other hand, a candidate for a Ph.D. program should be fully funded, that is, the university waives the student’s tuition, and will pay them a (sometimes barely) living stipend, with the student having to work as a TA in exchange.
Kenyon is about an hour away from Columbus, so that coordination program sounds like it would be perhaps once a week, and a student would need a car if the school does not provide van or other transportation for participating students.
An email to the administrative assistant for the Psych dept, asking who would be best equipped within the department to answer questions about preparation for grad school and past track record for grad school admission, would be a way to get the OP’s questions in front of someone with knowledge.  The other approach is to email the Chair of the department directly, but sometimes those emails can get lost in the shuffle.  We found that contacting the support staff for the department often meant they pointed us in the direction of the person who would be most responsive. I would also recommend a more detailed conversation with Financial Aid, asking about what might happen to aid if parent relocates etc.
Congrats to the OP’s daughter on her wonderful options!

How close do you think you need to live to her? I have never been to Gambier (will be there a week from Friday), but it doesn’t sound like the place that an adult finds a job and apartment. If you are able to be an hour away by car, that opens up the greater Columns and Cleveland areas.

Yes, there is not much in Gambier for an adult looking for employment, unless they worked for the College. Mt Vernon is about 10-15 minutes away, more of a town, with the usual chains and franchises, but still not a lot in terms of employment. Columbus is about an hour away, much of it on back roads, so not a mindless commute. Cleveland is close to 2 hours.
Gambier really is the middle of nowhere . . . .you either love it, or not!

As others have pointed out, as far as psychology goes, whether her interests are clinically and/or research-based, grad school will be the name of the game. The types of close relationships with professors that she will be able to develop at a place like Kenyon will be unmatched at a large, public university. These relationships, in turn, will translate into better recommendations and more support.
Does she need to major in a STEM field to maintain her status as a STEM Scholar?
Why not see how she is doing health-wise before you start moving across country?

All in all, for a kid who wants to do into research, Kenyon, being a highly selective LAC with lots of resources and professors who have been hired because of their ability to integrate undergraduates into their research, is ideal - especially due to the full ride.
Your having to switch jobs isn’t ideal though. Even if jobs are plentiful, the problem isn’t finding  job, it’s finding a good, stable job with good pay and benefits. Is your current job portable? Does your company have branches in the Columbus area?
Are you sure you have to move? Could you plan with the college’s health system, set up a plan for her so that she’s checked regularly by a doctor recommended by her hospital or knows what to do?

If you can actually afford to contribute without loans about $5,000 (possibly some of which may come from saving the amount of food and utilities that she consumes at home), then she would need $9,276 (typical amount of student contribution expected by UCs), which would be covered by $5,500 federal direct loan, $1,800 work study, and $1,976 other work earnings (e.g. summer and/or non-work-study part time jobs during the school year).

PhD programs’ sensitivity to school prestige (in major) appears to vary by subject.
Law school is mostly about college GPA and LSAT score.  See http://lawschoolnumbers.com .
Medical schools tend to first screen by college GPA and MCAT score, then holistic review considers many factors, including pre-med extracurriculars, interview, etc…  You may want to ask more in the pre-med forum section.

Congrats on you and your daughter’s decision, @cttrlvr. I’m glad you found something that worked for you and your family!
You do not need to start researching grad schools now  It’s too early! Let her settle into some career goals and research/professional interests first. I wouldn’t start thinking about a list until junior year at the earliest, once she’s gotten a chance to get some research experience and a little solidity in her career goals and interests.



Also, for the sake of the usefulness of this thread over the long-term your daughter’s doctor is wrong. It is not true that students have to attend a top-tier university to have hopes of getting into graduate school; this is true across fields.* I have a PhD in psychology and I went to a small LAC that is very good but not ranked as highly as Kenyon. Per capita, small liberal arts colleges produce more PhD graduates than large research universities. Colleges like Kalamazoo, Hillsdale, Allegheny, Hendrix, Franklin & Marshall and Occidental are in the top 50 producers of science and engineering (including psychology) PhDs per capita.
I wouldn’t say a student is better off at a small LAC. It’s more that a student who has found a good fit school for her can get into graduate school from wherever she goes, as long as she pursues the kinds of experiences that graduate schools value. Assuming that’s a PhD program in psychology, that would be research experience assisting a professor in their research group, summer research experiences (preferably at another campus and/or with other professors, so she can grow her network), presenting research at conferences, maybe getting a publication (not necessary, but a nice cherry on top). They also include good letters of recommendation and writing a strong personal statement that coherently discusses research interests and career goals, but those things tend to come more naturally after a student has had these kinds of experiences and connections. Good grades and high GRE scores are also necessary. And if she’s interested in clinical psychology, clinical volunteering experience is necessary as well.
A sufficiently motivated student could get that anywhere - a great small liberal arts college or a great large public university. The doctoral students I knew (at my own program and those I created networks with) came from across the spectrum of colleges and universities, from top-tier places to small regional public universities.
*I should add that in some fields - like math or philosophy - undergrad college may matter more.

Congrats on you and your daughter’s decision, @cttrlvr. I’m glad you found something that worked for you and your family!

Congratulations!
And if you find that UCSD is not the right school and the medical issues settle, then she could transfer. As for your your dream of moving out of California has been pushed back four years (at most). In the grand scheme of things, not that long for an adult.
Your daughter will be fine :). Congratulations to her for being on incredible in such difficult circumstances.
