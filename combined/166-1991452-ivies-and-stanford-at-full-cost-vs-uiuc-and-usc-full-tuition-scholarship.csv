You should have financial aid offers already. Did you run NPC calculators last fall to check on needs based aid from Ivy’s/Stanford?  Full tuition is a nice offer.
Does your child have a major in mind?
USC is a good school. UIUC is very good for some majors.

OP,
my DS was in the same situation a few years back. Got into Chicago, Dartmouth, Brown as well as some great LAC’s.
He chose USC , graduated with honors and was one of only 10 students who received Discovery Scholars 10K awards for grad school.
He just received his PhD from CalTech, the most prestigious grad U in the world, also at no cost.
His intention all along was to go to CT for grad school, and USC helped make that happen.
He never regretted going to USC. He found his “peeps” in the small Honors Science and Humanities classes, was able to do funded research all 4 years, and  he wants to go back to be a professor.
You graduate will be treated like Gold at USC.
And there is Nothing like being able to wear shorts and sandles all year long, lol!

For econ, I think USC and their network would beat UIUC so I would eliminate Illinois.
So it comes down to whether full-tuition scholarship at USC beats out being full-pay at Stanford/Harvard.
He can definitely get a job coming out of USC. That’s a pretty low bar. But Stanford and Harvard are still more target schools for some industries than USC. So it really depends on what he is aiming for, how much being full-pay would hurt, etc.

USC has produced the 4th most billionaires of any US university   I don’t think Stanford or Harvard would have been worth it for them. Not even considering the full ride.  And their amount of alumni giving is mentioned in the press as astronomical compared to other schools
So if I was a football star and was offered a full ride I should say no and play football for Harvard or Stanford and pay them 73k a year after taxes for the privilege of doing so.  Just so I could impress my boss neighbor or someone at s cocktail party
If it were revenue neutral I would pick h or s of course.  But this whole conversation is silly.

@ewho, actually, the stock market (S&P 500) has averaged 10% annual returns over the past 90 years. And over every 40 year period in that timeframe, the average annual compounded returns for a 40 year period have ranged from 8.9% to 12.5%. I picked 5% to be extremely conservative. And sure, you’d have to pay taxes. You have to pay taxes on anything. That still doesn’t change the fact that if you take $200K and let it compound instead of spending it, you’re going to end up with a ton of money. Millions. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather have millions and pay taxes on that than not have millions.
And certainly, if the OP has so much wealth that they just have another $200K (or multiple $200K’s) lying around that they could let compound, then why not splurge? Like I said, if you have 8 figures in liquid assets, feel free to do whatever you like with that money.

But as I recall, the Ivy League features only 8 schools, and the easiest one to get into is Cornell.  What’s Cornell’s acceptance rate?  10%?  For me, to call more than a handful of public universities “public ivies” would have no meaning whatsoever.  Is San Diego St. (35% acceptance rate) often referred to as a public ivy?

@Momof2022 - What does your son/daughter want? What criteria did you give him/her when applying to schools in terms of what you were willing/able to contribute? What are her social/intellectual/academic wants and needs?
Yes, conventional CC wisdom will tell you to take the money from USC and run. But conventional wisdom doesn’t always provide right answers in every case.
My daughter had to make the same choice last year: she was offered full tuition scholarships at USC, Vandy, and Wash U (and others) and had also gotten into HYPS and UChicago (UChicago gave a decent merit and FA combination; HYPS gave very little FA (under 10K) and, of course, no merit.
The most important criterion my D had was that she wanted to be around really, really bright kids. Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.
USC was not a good fit for my D, despite thinking that it had some interesting programs and seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her – she would NOT have been happy there). Among her full tuition scholarship options, she liked Wash U. the best.
My D, with our unwavering support, chose Stanford and could NOT be happier. To us, it is worth every penny.
That said, she is our only child, so we don’t have any more tuitions to pay. We drive old cars and don’t take lavish vacations. My D is not seeking an education as a means to an end – the only return on investment she seeks (and that we hope for her) is greater knowledge. She will likely end up in a PhD program in the humanities. She loves what she is studying, has had some absolutely amazing and supportive professors, enjoys her fellow students, and finally feels like she has intellectual peers (something she did not have in HS).
She has truly found her tribe there and is absolutely, positively 100% certain that she made the right choice. My DH and I are too.

@LoveTheBard, I agree that USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body and that WashU would have the most out of USC/Vandy/WashU (I would have picked the U of C, BTW, but anyway, that’s a different discussion). The OP will have to decide if that matters. From a purely ROI perspective, turning down the full-tuition scholarship to USC is tough to justify.

Take money out of the equation for a second. No financial concerns where would you go, Harvard, Stanford or USC? And why?
Now add finances back tot he equation. Assuming Harvard / Stanford is the choice, can you make it work without significant hardship on your lifestyle, retirement, etc? If so, great. If not, USC (which is also great)
Big difference between “should I pay vs. could I pay?”  If you’re fortunate enough to be in the “Should I pay” group, really think about the “why”. If it’s meaningful, pay, if not, don’t.

USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body.
OP. Everyone has their own view on things but this is only personal opinion. There are many doctors researchers professors and other really smart and successful grads that come out of USC. If someone preferred to go to Stanford it’s understandable. But a candidate from USC could easily be in the same PhD program post grad with them and would be very intellectual indeed.
Will there be kids at USC that didn’t have the stats to get into hyps or even Chicago. Sure. But they might be just as smart and turn it on in college or they aren’t but they work hard and e d up starting the next Twitter.  Who knows.

Yes, some USC grads do go on to get PhDs, but a far smaller proportion of the student body than at HYPSM or the U of C.
And yes, it’s an overgeneralization, but I think you’d find that a significantly smaller portion of the USC student body go there mainly or solely for the pursuit of knowledge. It’s definitely a pre-professionally focused student body, and there’s nothing wrong with that, nor do I think that’s bad for the OP, who seems pretty pre-professionally focused, but my impression is that a smaller proportion of the kids at USC go there to live the life of the mind compared to at the U of C or HYPSM.

In terms of schools having an “intellectual student body”.
At many no-name high schools all over the country, the seniors most likely to get into Harvard and Stanford are the recruited athletes.  Are they smart?  Sure.  Are they intellectual?  Maybe or maybe not, but that has nothing to do with why they would get in and many smarter and more intellectual students would not.   Often the middle class intellectual students are those who decide to take a merit scholarship.   They are overlooked by the Ivies because being an intellectual does not necessarily translate into an outstanding college application.
Some, like LoveTheBard’s daughter, are so brilliant they easily stand out and are admitted to those schools.  Most don’t stand out nearly as much as the wealthy student from the connected private schools who regularly send a significant number of students to those schools.
“Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.”
It’s a bit like the blind men touching one part of the elephant and being certain of its shape based on the part they touched.
A family member went to Stanford and it is not “intellectual”.  It has many students who ARE intellectual and it has  students who are not and are very career focused.  As does Harvard.  As does U. Chicago.  As do Wash U., Duke and USC.  A student can choose to seek them out or not.
Making a difference doesn’t always mean starting a foundation with your family’s money or the connections they have to help you start it. It doesn’t mean developing an app that someone will pay you millions to buy. Making a difference may be those “dull” serious students working hard for As to get into medical school and be the doctors who save lives.  Making a difference may be those “dull” scientists sitting in their labs examining some tiny aspect of mitochondria that will eventually lead to a cure for some disease.
Making a difference is not always an earnest “intellectual” student who loves to talk about ideas and even write about them.

I suspect the most purely intellectual college is Reed.  That is why it is not interested in playing the rankings game.  The rankings game is all about attracting a lot of applicants who - deep down – are more concerned with prestige than anything else.
U. of Chicago was one of the most intellectual colleges back when it had 30% and higher admissions rates.  Students didn’t apply there because of prestige – they applied there because they wanted that kind of education.
Chasing prestige is fine and understandable.  But it isn’t something that intellectual colleges care about.

@USCWolverine - In answer to your question, no, I did not say that “USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body.” What I said was “USC was not a good fit for my D, despite her thinking that it had some interesting programs and that it seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her – she would NOT have been happy there).” She felt this more socially than academically; immediately after visiting USC, she went to Grinnell (another school that offered her full tuition) which she thought would be a better social – but not as good of an academic (their art history programs were not as interesting to her) – fit.
Of course USC has many, many bright and intellectually curious kids. And Stanford has no shortage of kids that are not the least bit intellectually curious. But the level of discussion in the classrooms and the level of intellectual engagement she experienced was, in the aggregate, qualitatively different among kids at Yale, Stanford, and U Chicago that they were at schools like Vanderbilt, USC, Wash U., etc. (And I agree, getting an overall feel for a school is a bit like blind men poking at an elephant and oftentimes one sees what one wants to see.) Ultimately, for my daughter, it was a matter of not wanting to be a big fish in a smaller pond; she wanted a bigger pond in which to swim.
(And yes, UChicago was a definite contender but she didn’t want the weather; Yale was initially her top choice until she got to New Haven and hated it; she thought about Reed, but ultimately decided not to apply because they did not offer any merit aid (the only non-HYPS schools she applied to were those that offered significant merit aid and she submitted separate scholarship applications to any school that required them). She would have been all over Deep Springs had they been accepting applications from women last year.
And as @rickle1 points out, there is a “Big difference between “should I pay vs. could I pay?” If you’re fortunate enough to be in the “Should I pay” group, really think about the “why”. If it’s meaningful, pay, if not, don’t.” It seems that OP is in that group. And @MYOS1634 is quite correct, there are plenty of families that are tempted to pull the rug out from their kids’ feet when faced with this type of decision.
My daughter was very, very concerned about the finances and she is very well aware that money that is spent on her undergraduate tuition is money that might otherwise be used for other things (e.g., putting a down payment on a home or investing in stocks). In creating her list, we encouraged her to cast a wide net among in-state publics (UCs), LACs and research universities that offered merit aid, and HYPS, etc. and that we would consider her options when we had the results.
Every situation and every family is different. I’m just adding another data point and another point of view.

@USCWolverine - In answer to your question, no, I did not say that “USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body.” What I said was “USC was not a good fit for my D, despite her thinking that it had some interesting programs and that it seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her – she would NOT have been happy there).” She felt this more socially than academically; immediately after visiting USC, she went to Grinnell (another school that offered her full tuition) which she thought would be a better social – but not as good of an academic (their art history programs were not as interesting to her) – fit.
Of course USC has many, many bright and intellectually curious kids. And Stanford has no shortage of kids that are not the least bit intellectually curious. But the level of discussion in the classrooms and the level of intellectual engagement she experienced was, in the aggregate, qualitatively different among kids at Yale, Stanford, and U Chicago that they were at schools like Vanderbilt, USC, Wash U., etc. (And I agree, getting an overall feel for a school is a bit like blind men poking at an elephant and oftentimes one sees what one wants to see.) Ultimately, for my daughter, it was a matter of not wanting to be a big fish in a smaller pond; she wanted a bigger pond in which to swim.
(And yes, UChicago was a definite contender but she didn’t want the weather; Yale was initially her top choice until she got to New Haven and hated it; she thought about Reed, but ultimately decided not to apply because they did not offer any merit aid (the only non-HYPS schools she applied to were those that offered significant merit aid and she submitted separate scholarship applications to any school that required them). She would have been all over Deep Springs had they been accepting applications from women last year.
And as @rickle1 points out, there is a “Big difference between “should I pay vs. could I pay?” If you’re fortunate enough to be in the “Should I pay” group, really think about the “why”. If it’s meaningful, pay, if not, don’t.” It seems that OP is in that group. And @MYOS1634 is quite correct, there are plenty of families that are tempted to pull the rug out from their kids’ feet when faced with this type of decision.
My daughter was very, very concerned about the finances and she is very well aware that money that is spent on her undergraduate tuition is money that might otherwise be used for other things (e.g., putting a down payment on a home or investing in stocks). In creating her list, we encouraged her to cast a wide net among in-state publics (UCs), LACs and research universities that offered merit aid, and HYPS, etc. and that we would consider her options when we had the results.
Every situation and every family is different. I’m just adding another data point and another point of view.

@CU123, some schools care more about how they transform their students than whether you or anyone else think they are at the top or bottom. Reed is among the top 10 feeders (on a per capita basis) in almost all major PhD subjects despite what you may think of them and thus, when you tier by alumni acheivements, they’re actually an Ivy-equivalent despite being ranked nowhere near the top by USNews.

@PurpleTitan No, I don’t, I am simply recognizing THE FACT that rankings are HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL in decision making by applicants and that in turn affects the alumni universities produce.  Period,  Even Reed acknowledges that fact.  Putting your head in the sand and saying rankings don’t make any difference is ridiculous.  BTW, Reed does participate is rankings it does like, not that it is hypocritical or anything.  Whether you “like” rankings or not isn’t germane to this discussion, in fact any ranking (or polls for that matter) system to include sports, colleges, etc will always be controversial.

@CU123, and again, all that highly influential decision-making leads to Reed producing alums that go in to PhD programs in numbers that almost no other school can match despite their ranking being where it is.
So you’re essentially saying that a college football program that consistently wins a ton of games and sends a ton of players to the NFL should care about it’s recruiting rankings because it’s recruiting isn’t highly ranked.

I’ve spent plenty of time at both USC and Stanford, and rarely overheard discussions at either campus that were on the level of Plato’s Dialogues. The main difference i found between the two schools is that, on average, Stanford students and teachers are more driven and take their academics more seriously than those at USC. But that doesn’t mean the students at Stanford are geniuses, or the student body at SC is unintellectual. I never got the sense that classes at Stanford were any more challenging than those at USC.
After a few beers, anyone at any school can carry on a deeply intellectual conversation.

@simba9 - My D is in an intensive humanities living/learning core program (a sort of Western – and some Eastern – Civilization course) at Stanford. During the first quarter, there were no shortage of conversations that, while perhaps not at the level of Plato’s Dialogues, certainly concerned themselves with Plato’s Dialogues. Discussions spilled out of the classroom and into the dining hall and later into the lounge. They’ve since moved well past Plato and Aristotle and more recent discussions are about Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Marx and W. E. B. Du Bois.
There are no right or wrong answers to the choice between taking a full-tuition scholarship at USC versus being full pay at Stanford, and it is completely dependent upon a variety of other factors involving all aspects of fit – academic, social, intellectual, and economic.

@LoveTheBard I gather you are talking about SLE (Structured Liberal Education), which they have had at Stanford for a long time (even when I attended).  That experience is probably different from that of most students at Stanford, but it’s limited to 90 students a year.  Also, because they live in a separate dorm, they are somewhat isolated from other students, and I don’t think I ever interacted with anyone from SLE.
When I attended, students were required to take a year-long course in Western Civilization, which was intended to be equivalent to the Great Books curriculum at UChicago and Columbia, and which was supposed to stimulate common discussion among students on a shared reading list.  But we had 9 or so different tracks for Western Civ, each sponsored by a different department, such as history or science and technology, so we never really all read the same set of books.  Anyway, Stanford eliminated its Western Civ requirement 30 years ago, due in part to student pressure, so aside from SLE, there hasn’t been a common core experience at Stanford in a long time.
Stanford has long had a cultural divide between those who major in STEM subjects and those who major in the humanities and social sciences.  Back then, they called each other “techies” and “fuzzies”, and apparently, those terms are still in use today.  See, for example, this recent commentary from the Stanford Daily about the phenomenon:

Congrats to your son on his tremendous accomplishments. Some have referenced the USC scholarship as a golden ticket, but those other admission offers must feel like golden tickets too. Walking away from the Ivy offers of admission is going to be understandably hard. We are in a somewhat similar situation where the first choice school was very clear when costs were equal, but a last minute full academic scholarship at #2 makes the choice more difficult.  In our case, the cost differential is much smaller (maybe about 60-70k) but once you “see” that cost savings it is very hard to “unsee” it.   Best of luck with the decision.

@mdphd92 - Yes, I was referring to SLE and yes, it’s been around forever (the parents of one of the students is SLE this year met at SLE during their freshman year over a quarter of a century ago).
As for the techie/fuzzy divide, my D is far less apologetic about her choice of study than the author of that article. She has no “shame… about being a fuzzy” nor “insecurity about pursuing an uncommon path…” She embraces her choices wholeheartedly and is passionate about what she is studying.
It is indeed the case that STEM fields reign supreme at many colleges and universities these days. Humanities and the arts often get short shrift in a society where “return on investment” and job placement seem to be among the most important factors in choosing an institute of higher learning. (Most of the posts on this thread concern themselves with this very issue). It is also the case that those who choose to study the humanities at Stanford can have all of the faculty support and resources they need.
I see Stanford as ahead of the curve on this – while other schools are scrambling to shore up their STEM programs, Stanford has been investing some real money into its arts and humanities programs over the course of the last decade.
Oh, as to the question “What came first, the fuzzy or the techie?” My answer is “Neither.” Back in Leonardo’s day, science and art were not seen in such mutually exclusive terms; he is celebrated as much for his scientific genius as he was for his artistic genius.
And, @USCWolverine – just because USC was not a good fit for my D, who happened to be seeking an intellectual vibe, does not mean that there aren’t a great number of highly intellectual students and faculty there and that it isn’t a fabulous school. It just wasn’t the “golden ticket” for my daughter.

IMO, for fuzzies—humanities majors–the brand name of the college really matters; a HYPS degree would probably go a long way to boost one’s career prospect.  For techies, not so much, among new hires at FANG, SJSU beats MIT and U of Phoenix beats Harvard.  Economics/business (OP son’s intended study), at undergrad level, is probably more fuzzy than techie.
This question of Stanford/Harvard(full pay) vs USC(or similar schools) full tuition merit is asked multiple times every year on CC. Though the opinion seems to be 10 to 1 in favor of merit I have yet to see a taker of that option.

I had this conversation back then with him about USC scholarship vs Stanford.  I am an SC alum that’s why :).  Told him if he got scholarship from SC he should go there (he is a science/math kid who loves to dance).  So that’s our value.  Each family have their own values.
Well things do not go as planned.  He decided he wanted to pursue dance (together with bio) so now USC dance program became his #1 choice. Like film school, it’s extremely hard to get in.  He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super “intellectual” kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC’s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.  We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.  Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship.

We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.  Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship.

Seriously folks. These grand generalizations are meaningless. Like any broad generalizations they may be grounded in the past experiences or continuation of a myth.
Here’s a real world 2018 example.
I
my d is valedictorian of her top 30 us public high school. Number 1 in Florida. 1540 sat 4.0 uw gpa.  35 act 13 aps with 11 5s and 1 4.  President of Spanish honor society and captain of academic decathlon team as only female. And was ap physics ap bio and ap chem student of the year. Going to USC for bio chem premed. She doesn’t sit around with her friends smoking weed and discussing the Freud Jungian schism.  But she’s pretty intellectual.
It just doesn’t matter. Go to Stanford kick butt and pay back the loans. Go to usc kick butt and not have to pay the loans. The same exact opportunity for success is available in either path.
Go where you feel best about yourself and an environment that promotes your best work.  It could be either but it’s unique  to each student.

If your student attends USC on a full tuition scholarship they won’t be the only one there who gave up an Ivy. It’s not uncommon. Save your money for the Wharton or Harvard MBA.

I think money matters the most if it’s even a slight concern, because all these colleges offer a comparable education and their pros and cons. If your student has a strong preference towards a single college, that should trump everything else, but if not, I think money could be important.

@ultapradesh - According to their FA info, approximately half of the aid given at UIUC is based on merit, and half based on need:
http://admissions.illinois.edu/Invest/financial-aid
It looks like they don’t give aid to international students, but they don’t indicate that OOS students are not eligible for FA or merit scholarships, other than one or two scholarships specific to Illinois residents.
Here’s a list of merit scholarships:

@LoveTheBard    Thanks. Under Illinois Residents & Non-Residents category there is only $2000 award. It seems that UUIC not a good fit for OOS student looking for merit or need based aid.
