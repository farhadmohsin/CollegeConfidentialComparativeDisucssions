^^^ I am a happy and proud Syracuse grad.
However, I can only assume the author suffered from third-degree brain freeze to reach that conclusion.

Yes, there is a lot to do at Syracuse, @meganewarren .  Tons of concerts and sporting events and clubs and things of that nature.  A good local theater group (Syracuse Stage) and beautiful proscenium theater (The Landmark). The Dome, despite it’s ugliness, has many premier events.  Few things are more fun than a packed SU basketball game!
Like many big colleges, the University Union is well funded and always has something going on.  I was very involved with it and saw everything free! lol Films, Concerts, Speakers, etc.
http://www.universityunion.syr.edu/
Because of the weather SU is big on what I will refer to as “indoor sports”.  Marshall street is where the bars/restaurants are, but it is essentially on campus.  You’ll run into everyone there.  The Varsity is the most famous local beer/pizza/wings joint but there are many. http://varsitysyracuse.com/.  And of course Dinosaur BBQ.
I had an excellent time there and was very involved in stuff, although it was long ago.  Campus is great, weather is awful… all the things you hear are true.  But the city of Syracuse, which I have an affinity for, is not what I would call a “great college town”.
But you will not be bored.
Good luck!

Is your current list especially heavy on northeast or southern schools? If so, maybe choose the university in the underrepresented region.
NC State would give you access to Research Triangle firms for internships. I went there many years ago but was in the engineering school so I have no idea how the programs at the two schools compare for bio/env sci. The faculty at NC State were terrific though.

If you visited NC State and think it is fine, your dad prefers it and you haven’t seen Syracuse then NC State seems like the better/safer application for you.

I’m also a Syracuse grad and @Postmodern made me laugh. I would say Syracuse has a lot to do, sure. I would also say that if you’re a southerner you need to be prepared that lake effect snow is not kidding around. It will snow a lot. A LOT. It will be very cold and windy, like from October until April. If you’re not prepared for that sort of weather, I’d mark it off your list. (I grew up nearby so it wasn’t a huge change for me, but coming from the south I imagine it would be a huge shock.) I also didn’t find Syracuse all that public-transportation-friendly, but things may well have changed since I was there.
My most vivid memory of my time there was walking up to campus to take the GRE on a Saturday when the wind chill was something like 30 below zero. I lived three blocks from the building where I took the test and when I got there I was afraid I had frostbite. (I was fine.) It’s a great school, don’t get me wrong. But the weather is nuts.

Do not underestimate the winters in Syracuse. My daughter went to school nearby and found it intolerable at times- and we are from the northeast. There is a lot to do in the area but in my opinion it is very different than NC State, both in terms of location and students. Fill out the NPC and see what kind of aid you may get.

Would you change anything about your experience at State?

I wish I had taken better advantage of the opportunities I was offered at NC State. I also wish I had done a better job of seeking out friends. Both of those were my shortcomings though, not the school’s (funny what a few decades of perspective can do).
I did participate in the co-op program and it was one of the best things I’ve ever done.

I’d prefer NC State but for non-academic reasons. Neither school is academically amazing, but you can’t get better than the weather in NC. Syracuse is freezing during most of the school year.

Technically, however, the city’s climate, even when considered by daily low temperature, averages above freezing during September, October, November, April and May.

Glad you ran them…affordability is a very important part of the process.  Since BU is probably out of the equation, maybe see if you can find a way to apply to both Syracuse and State…if you have to choose one it sounds like State is the more affordable option, a school you have seen, and one your dad prefers…

I live in NC and NCSU is a fine school (especially for STEM) and a really wonderful campus for me. However it is not particularly flexible for majors since you have to apply to the particular school you want to major in, and it is pretty focused once you are in it (ex. in the engineering school your first year courses are pretty much entirely for that major, so if you wanted to switch to polysci sophomore year, you’d not only have to switch schools but be behind). For an undecided person, this could be a problem, combined with the low availability of aid for OOS students.
On the other hand, NC State is bigger and has lots of major choices and social scenes. Raleigh is also an incredible location both for fun and for jobs/internships. Syracuse is much more difficult to get into, even being OOS for NCSU. I don’t know much about the flexibility of Syracuse.
If you want to know anything about NC weather or NCSU I can answer a lot, since I used to be rather obsessed with attending there.
