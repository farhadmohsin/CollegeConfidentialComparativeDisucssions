This is really such a matter of fit.
I went to Duke, D will be going to Brown, and we both loved Berkeley when we visited for a 2 day program.  Although Duke is located in the South, most of the kids come from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, California and Florida.  Duke does not feel like a Southern school and even though it’s not located in a major city, there is constantly a lot going on with incredible speakers from all over the world and all sorts of research opportunities.  After taking the college tour, my D’s comment was “mom, there is so much going on there, it feels like they are throwing opportunities at you.”  FWIW, Melinda Gates went to Duke and has donated a lot of money there.  Duke is constantly is reaching out to its Alumni to create internships and all sorts of learning opportunities for its students.  Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley.
I think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn’t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates.
But these were our impressions. Hopefully others can give you theirs too so you can get a better feel about if there’s a consistent theme.   Good luck, and you really can’t go wrong. Once you choose, don’t look back, only look forward.

We are not you and cannot make the choice for you.  Do you want to live on the East Coast or the West Coast?  If the East Cost, north or south?  Do you want to live in an environment that has you near Silicon Valley or not?  The good news is you really can’t go wrong on the education front.  I’d be cautious of CS ranking placement for undergraduate studies.  My son fell into that trap, and found out that at the undergraduate level it is either good school or not good school.  For your choices nobody would argue which category these three fall.  You live in MA, do you want to see your home often during the school year, either you visiting home or home visiting you?  Do you like the NE and could live nowhere else?  Are you open to a new adventure?  Notice, none of my questions have to do with academics, it is all about what makes you you.

I have nothing specific to add about the three schools as although different personalities and locations they are all outstanding schools and programs. The OP did make a reference to graduating in three years. That would not be likely at any of these schools or many other schools. Even if all required courses are completed in three years, many schools require 4 years of attendance and tuition payments. Not all eight semesters are required to be on campus attendance allowing for internships, semester abroad, exchange programs at other schools, etc.

Berkeley can be done in 3 years. Lots of kids do and the university widely accepts AP credit unlike private colleges. they are sensitive to the community college kids who transfer in and others who financially need to get it done in 3 years. My Berkeley student took summer classes and with AP could have been done in 3 years. I told her to take the extra year as she’ll be working the rest of her life.

OP, it’s one thing to just get an entry level job in the valley. Another good metric of a university’s quality is how well its graduates do at the executive level.
Duke can lay claim to Tim Cook (Apple’s CEO), Eddie Cue (Apple’s Sr VP of Internet Software and Services), Jeff Williams (Apple’s COO), Amy Hood (Microsoft’s CFO), Scott Guthrie (Head of Microsoft’s AI and Cloud Computing divisions), Terry Myerson (EVP and former head of Windows at Microsoft), etc.
^ I’m sure that Brown and Cal have alums in high places but that list is pretty hard to beat. 3 of Apple’s 11 top executives have Duke degrees as do 3 of Microsoft’s top 16.

I know that you can come up with a list of Berkeley alums who’ve done exceedingly well in tech. I’m not trying to say that Duke sends more people to the valley or anything of the sort. Just pointing out that our graduates are often disproportionately well represented in the highest echelons. Not bad for a school that is supposed to have a sub par CS program!

Yes, I can see where you’re coming from too.
I think with most things what you do matters much more than where you go but there are some exceptions. Harvard’s neurosurgery residency program probably won’t seriously consider an applicant who didn’t attend a top medical school. Similarly, some VC firms virtually require their employees to have elite undergraduate degrees.
It’s probably also easier to excel as an undergraduate at an elite private school. Self-motivated students who are confident in their ability should definitely consider the state school option if it makes financial sense.
Finally, the mediocre (3.4-3.7) Penn student has a much better shot of getting to HBS than the mediocre Alabama student.

For CS and entrerpreneurship esp technology startups, Berkeley is the best choice, probably by a lot.  It wouldn’t compare as well for wall street but as others have said, wall street and if you wanted a data science job say at a wall street bank, Berkeley would do fine.
“I know that you can come up with a list of Berkeley alums who’ve done exceedingly well in tech.”
For sure, because there are many of them.  Apple, Intel, Mozilla, Zynga, among tech, also non-tech, Gap and Dean Witter as I found out.
