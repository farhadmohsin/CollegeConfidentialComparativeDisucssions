I’d suggest:

If one of the schools turns out to be materially more affordable, go there.
If finances are equal visit both during accepted students day and decide.

I’m currently undecided and not leaning towards any specific field or major (unhelpful, I know). I like that they both offer a strong liberal arts education, and I could see myself attending either of them

Georgetown has some very fine professional schools, but in the liberal arts there is little (if any) difference between Georgetown and BC. I’d select based on fit.

– BC has a stronger conservative/catholic tradition than Georgetown, which is pretty liberal despite being Jesuit
– Georgetown is known for having a wealthier student body than BC
– BC Hockey, Georgetown basketball (not the greatest but there’s a lot of history and tradition in their program)
– Suburban vibe at BC vs more of an urban vibe at Georgetown
– Georgetown has a competitive nature (getting into clubs etc.) BC not so much (but this can be a pro or a con because some people thrive in a competitive environment.

Georgetown is a little better overall, in my opinion. If they are even for fit and cost, or if you aren’t sure, I would choose Georgetown.
However, BC is a good school, and if you strongly prefer Boston and/or the (full) D1 sports scene… or if there is a sizable difference in cost… then BC would make sense.
For some context: Georgetown’s undergraduate peers include (IMO) Notre Dame, Washington U, Rice, Emory, Vanderbilt, and maybe CMU.
I have BC’s peers as Wake Forest, Lehigh, Tulane, U of Rochester, NYU, BU, Case, Brandeis… maybe Tufts and USC. Some have those last two in a different group.

BC is a 20 minutes by car to downtown, less than 40 minutos in metro (trolley, very slowly} B green line, but normally people from BC don’t go to downtown, not need to do it, you can find every things to do near campus, at 20 minutes by metro or less than 10 minutes by car o BC bus.

Great choices. Congratulations. We have the same choices but admitted students day(s) pushed it clearly to Boston College. Facilities. The vibe of the kids and smiles. Commitment to core and core renewal was excellent. My D is a premed and total STEM focus. Having a commitment to liberal arts for all as part of the educational process is important to her.  No wrong choices here for you.  USNWR has Gtown at 20 and BC 30.  Forbes and elsewhere are similar. BCs business school is even better. PreMed counseling center is better at BC in our opinion as well. Know folks who went through both. Follow your heart and your head will be fine

I have been discussing FA with Georgetown over the last few weeks. Siblings only count to reduce the EFC at Georgetown if they are enrolled in an undergrad program. Feel free to go in person, but I don’t get the idea that there is a lot of flexibility from the FA office. They have been responsive, but not budging. They advised us that they do not consider scholarships awarded from other universities. We received a good package, but year 4 is making it look  impossible because my EFC will go up 40% (GU explained that they split the EFC between two kids as 60/40)
