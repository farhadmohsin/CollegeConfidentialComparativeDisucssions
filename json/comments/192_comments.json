UT Austin is in the heart of Austin, a major city of over two million people, while the other choices are located in much smaller cities. There is a major airport located in Austin as well, to simplify travel there and back home. You would have tons of opportunities for possible internships locally or a variety of activities, and you would have access to all kinds of resources that big cities have. UT Austin Computer Science program is a top 10 program based in the Gates-Dell Complex that opened in 2013 (see https://news.utexas.edu/2013/03/06/for-wed-gates-computer-science-complex-and-dell-hall-begin-new-era-of-computing-education-and-research). UT also has the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) which is one of the best supercomputing centers in the country. If you could afford UT and were sure of getting into the CS program, that is probably the best option on your list. But finances often do dictate choices, and that is okay too, so it would be perfectly fine to choose U Mass for that reason. My daughter got into Cornell, but she chose another university that offered her big scholarships because finances were an issue. We all have to make decisions that fit the reality of our situation. For U Mass, you would be flying in and out of Boston likely, and get to know that city in addition to Amherst. In the summers you could do internships anywhere in the country or world, so you won\u2019t be entirely limited by your location of study. If finances are the main consideration at this point, then you already have your answer of where to go.<br><br>", "<b>Username: pat07ek</b><br><br>Thanks a lot @mommyrocks<br><br>", "<b>Username: NEPatsGirl</b><br><br>UMass is well regarded for the CS program.  It is in a five college consortium so you can take classes elsewhere if you choose although I think its usually the LAC students that go to the University for classes unavailable to them in the smaller schools.  UT Austin is an additional $50,000.  You have to ask yourself, all other things being equal is being in a hot climate vs. cold climate desirable?  Is easier access to the airport a selling point?

There is no way I would recommend 30 K (or 20K) more debt for a school that is a PEER of UMass for CS. The US is not so sensitive to tiny ranking differences. No one cares if you are #24 versus #25.

Saying all four colleges are great may be accurate but it\u2019s not an useful answer and it doesn\u2019t help the OP.  Austin has good weather, diverse campus and strong programs across the board in addition to an excellent CS program.  I can\u2019t answer the debt question as that\u2019s for the OP and family to decide.  Boston is diverse, but we\u2019re not comparing the cities, we\u2019re comparing the campuses.<br><br>"]}
