{"title": "pitt bsmd guaranteed admission program vs yale close to full ride", "comments": ["<b>Username: Deming</b><br><br>My son had his GAP interview at Pitt\u2019s School of Medicine yesterday and it went pretty well. He\u2019s very confident that he\u2019s gonna get admitted into the program, but at the same time is struggling in deciding if he should be attending as he has an offer from Yale with a financial-aid package close to full-ride.<br>His ultimate goal is going medicine. Going with the Pitt\u2019s GAP is obviously the way to achieve his goal in one-step shot in a top-10 med school, however, he is looking at about 20k/yr for four under graduate years (he\u2019s awarded 20k scholarship but we have to pay the out-state tuition since we are from California), vs Yale offered a total package with only 5k EFC. The other thing bothers my son is that for the GAP you have to maintain a 3.75 for each semester (both overall and BCPM), which means if you miss one, you will be out from the guaranteed medical school admission and end up with a Pitt undergrad education for roughly a cost of 80k in four years, where with Yale you will earn a Ivy undergra education with far less cost and may still get to a decent med school down to the road.<br>It will be a hard decision for sure, and we don\u2019t know how to give advice to our kid. Anyone who experienced the same before can you please share your thoughts/experiences to help us?<br>Many thanks!<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>Yale would open up more opportunities.<br>Considering that it would cost less and the Pitt auto-admit requires an insanely high GPA (if he gets that GPA, other med school\u2019s are likely as well, so the auto-admit is of little benefit), this is a no-brainer.<br>How many people actually know what they really want to do with their life at 18, anyway? Wouldn\u2019t it suck if he realized that he didn\u2019t actually want to be a doctor after all but he went down the Pitt path?<br><br>", "<b>Username: RoundGenius</b><br><br>Between the cost and the name recognition, Yale is hard to beat.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MedSciBud</b><br><br>Please consider that in GAP, your S does not need to fight again 4 years from now for a med school admission with 2-3% acceptance rate!<br><br>", "<b>Username: trackmbe3</b><br><br>@Deming  In addition to weighing cost, prestige and fit, if your goal is med school, you should go to the school where you think you have the best shot at a high gpa. And where you can get the most opportunity to do research and intermships. Pitt is known for excellent sciences and has the Universy of Pittsburgh medical center right on campus for easy opportunity and access to gain experience through shadowing, research or internships. Yale students are generally brilliant so the question is if your competition are geniuses will you be able to do as well in the premed coursework there as at Pitt? And compete with them for internships, research opportunities?  This is not at all to belittle the quality of students at Pitt, which are of excellent quality too, but you can\u2019t compare the selective admissions process of Yale vs Pittsburgh. I hear anecdotally that the premed curriculum at Pitt is very rigorous and achieving high grades there will be difficult as well. You should try and speak to some premed students at both schools and find out how good are the premed professors at each school and how are the grading practices is each. Sometimes the grading at the more selective school, such as Yale,  is higher than at a less competitive school, particularly a state school where professors seek to weed out a majority of the class.  This could help you make the decison. Med schools don\u2019t care so much what undergrad school you go to as much as how you do in the sciences and what experience you obtain, showing a demonstrated interest in medicine. However if you decide to switch out of premed then Yale would provide more opportunity in my opinion. Also ask yourself if you thrive better as a big fish in a little pond (I.e., at Pitt)  or not?<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>^ If he maintains the insanely high GPA and still wants to be a doctor.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br><br><br><br> Deming:<br>\"\"<br>The other thing bothers my son is that for the GAP you have to maintain a 3.75 for each semester (both overall and BCPM),<br>\"\"<br><br>That very high GPA requirement significantly devalues the GAP at Pitt, since it is likely that most students (including many who could get into medical school the usual way) fail to meet it.  Meanwhile, a student who does meet that GPA, and gets a good MCAT score, has a good chance of medical school admission, though s/he will have to go through the application process.  See https://www.aamc.org/download/321508/data/factstablea23.pdf .<br><br>", "<b>Username: trackmbe3</b><br><br>I agree it will be difficult to maintain such a high gpa at Pitt.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Deming</b><br><br>Thanks to you all for very helpful points/thoughts. This discussion touches right on our painpoints in terms of making a decision. One voice is telling us this is the great opportunity if my son\u2019s long-term goal is going into medicine and this is his chance to his goal locked at this early stage without going through that hard selection process again he just went through (may be even tougher considering the depth of the requirements like MCAT vs SAT, GPAs for high school courses vs college courses, etc.). But on the other hand (mainly from our parents\u2019 perspectives), what if he fails to maintain the 3.75 GPA at one point? you are talking about giving up the close to full-ride opportunity at an Ivy university vs you pay 80k for a second tier undergrad and ended up going nowhere in medicine. It\u2019s very hard to us to justify this especially given our low financial status. Which way is really worth to go with? But certainly we don\u2019t want to put this pressure over our son just because of financial number. It\u2019s just like the decision whether you would let your kid do medicine or not. At the interview day, the Pitt med school gave our parents a budget projection in terms of how much debt the student is looking at after four years medical sudy, $320K! That\u2019s more than our house value or our life time saving, and it\u2019s all after tax out of the pocket. I worked hard for the last 20+ years and am still struggling for my mortgages and daily living. With that cash, you could be early-retired to some extend. So at the end of the day, where that equation is? Yale might be a safer way or at least you secure a decent education with less cost at the front while still leave the doors open for next steps in Medicine. But again, if we give this advice to the kid, we really don\u2019t want to see some day he comes back to us without getting into the medical school and feel regret. I don\u2019t know. We will obviously have a very tough decision to make\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: MedSciBud</b><br><br>@Deming - tough but good situation to be in - considering so many of us who are still waiting for one good admit!<br>Did your S get in Yale EA?

My D1 was a GAP admit a few years back, she had acceptances from Harvard, UPenn and other top schools for undergrad. In her case though, she did not receive any scholarships from either Harvard or UPenn, EFC too high as well.<br>She is at Pitt Med now. She graduated from Pitt with close to a perfect GPA and an MCAT score of 36 and did not even bother applying to other Med schools. She has had a fantastic experience at Pitt, both academically and socially. She has done a volunteer gig last summer in an Argentinian community hospital and has lined up a couple more for next summer. Recently, she and her team were given a sizable grant (from a private drug company) to implement a drug distribution model alongside their Pitt Pharmacy folks in rural China.

I know Pitt GAP is a very good program and there are tons of opportunities there for the kids. I am just not that so confident that my son can keep up good work in all four years (actually you need to perform well every semester as if your GPA fall off 3.75 one semester you are out). And not like the girls, the boys tend to be less self-disciplined when parents are not watching them. Parties, drinks, you know, all those college fun can easily make them forget their primary focus. I am just so worried.<br>If we don\u2019t have other choices then it\u2019s a straight call.

They each have their pluses and minuses.<br>As awesome as JHU is, it has a rep of being a grind for premeds.  JHU for med or residency.  Not so great for undergrads.<br>Yale is tough on premeds as well.  I\u2019ve told this story before.  When my son was a college freshman premed I ran into an old friend whose son was a freshman premed at Yale.  Her son was determined to go to med school and they were confident Yale would pave the way. The friend was aghast that my son was attending a mid-tier flagship and she voiced a lot of doubt about whether he\u2019d get into a med school.  Fast forward a few years, her son\u2019s GPA was not med-school worthy.  My son will be graduating from med school in May.<br>Don\u2019t believe the hype about Yale inflation and that everyone gets A\u2019s in their classes.  Maybe it\u2019s that way for other paths, but the premed prereqs are still weeder classes at Yale.  Like every other college in the nation, they must reduce the number of their premeds.<br>As for UPitt @ucbalumnus is exactly right.  College is much harder than high school when in a serious major.  Adding premed path into the mix makes things even more difficult.  I have two premed parent forums and every fall parents are posting that their child-who\u2019s-never-received-a-B-in-his-life is now struggling to bring his mid-semester C average in Gen Chem or Bio up to please-be-at-least-a-B.
