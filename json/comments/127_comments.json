At both of these schools, I plan on studying computer science and something related to music. I\u2019m pretty dead set on these subjects and I\u2019m pretty much completely certain I won\u2019t be changing majors or anything. In the future, I hope to have a career both working as a software developer (e.g. making websites/applications/software or pen testing) and working in music professionally (e.g. professional choirs and city music or composition gigs) or possibly somehow combining the two fields with a job that encompasses both (not sure yet).<br>I would really appreciate if people who are in similar situations to me, have children who were in similar situations to me, or know a lot about each school would help me out because that\u2019s usually the advice I find most helpful. Without further ado, here are my qualms about each school.<br><br>I am not interested in Carnegie Mellon's BCSA / Music and technology degree programs. I don't like how the major requirements are cut in half. I feel like it won't allow me to get enough of an education in both. Carnegie Mellon would require me to internally transfer into their music program for me to double major or double degree. There's always the chance I could be rejected and have to apply again and again. Apparently, speaking to students who go there, the faculty is pretty understanding and will help me with portfolios/auditions through private lessons. At Columbia, their music program accepts everyone because it's a BA. It has similar classes in theory, ear training, etc and it also has a jazz concentration. I know that they also have professional-level voice repertoire classes taught at Barnard which I most likely would not be good enough to take at CMU.<br>Both schools have private musical lessons (Is CMU's faculty better?). Carnegie Mellon has a fully produced opera which would have been cool to do. I don't think Columbia has that though. <br>At CMU, a double major would likely take 4-5 years depending on if I decide to take summer classes (I feel like those would be boring in Pittsburgh). At Columbia, I would most likely try and transfer into the 3-2 program which is a B.S. and a B.A. but I would be forced to do all the major requirements for both SEAS and CC which seems like a lot of work. Alternatively, I could just double major in CC. I would again possibly take summer classes for Columbia.<br>Financially, I haven't received my FA package from Columbia yet, but as long as it's around the same as Carnegie Mellon, it doesn't really matter. The main thing I'm concerned about is the student life. I'm assuming people at Columbia enjoy going to expensive restaurants and clubbing in the city for social activities rather than chilling in dorms and going to different house get-togethers at Pittsburgh. Financially, I don't think I can afford to go out every weekend and do crazy expensive things. I feel as though maybe I'd miss out at Columbia but I'm not sure about this.<br>Carnegie Mellon has the best computer science school in the country and very possibly, in the world. One of the things they told me when I visited was that they don't teach specific languages, they teach CS so that even as the field constantly changes over time, the information learned remains applicable. I don't know if Columbia does this. I also like CMU's teaching style: they use note packets rather than textbooks a lot of the time. I feel like Columbia's teaching of CS would be more old-school since it's an ivy. I'm not sure if this is correct, however. I think I like CMU'S SCS better.<br>Someone from Columbia said they had no trouble getting interviews.. but that they failed their interviews.. I don't know if they're credible though, but that worries me.<br>The core curriculum at Columbia for the college takes up 14-16 classes. Apparently, a student from Columbia laughed at someone from Brown's (open curriculum) writing sample because it was terrible writing and they never had done any core English classes. I fear not being a good writer and having a condensed outlook on the world. A Columbia alum told me that the majority of people who haven't read the works they were forced to read in CORE are truly missing out intellectually. The problem is that I'm truly terrible with the humanities. Particularly, my analytical writing has always been bad and I'm a very slow reader and have a lot of trouble understanding the language and literary devices used in old anglo-saxon works. In school, when reading Shakesphere, I would always have to use resources such as \"No Fear\" to help me understand my readings. This wouldn't pass at Columbia.. Also, the thought of taking 14-16 humanities classes is something I'm not 100% sure I'd enjoy because truly, I've never done something like that. A lot of double majors at Columbia have expressed on college confidential that they'd rather be more involved in their major classes and I fear I won't have the opportunity to take all the classes I want.<br><br>I feel like the core curriculum is the same for Carnegie Mellon, however. I know that there are gened requirements that I\u2019d have to take in the humanities and literature (Barely any AP credit). Does anyone know if it\u2019s the same amount as Columbia? Because, if so, then the core curriculum really won\u2019t be that big of an issue since it\u2019s the same for both schools!<br>I have limited time to respond to their waitlist offer. Please let me know your thoughts! I\u2019m not really sure how to determine my \u201cfit\u201d. I love NYC and would love to live there, but at the same time, I want the flexibility to travel across the country and even across the world. I\u2019m really really stressed trying to decide this because I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll make the wrong choice! Thank you very much for all your wonderful help! I really cannot thank you enough. I apologize in advance for any grammar mistakes.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 1NJParent</b><br><br>You seems to to be committed to a CS career and you\u2019re not sure about the Columbia Core (a lot of other people aren\u2019t either). If that\u2019s the case, I too think you should stick with CMU SCS.<br><br>", "<b>Username: aquapt</b><br><br>I don\u2019t think \u201ctrade school-y\u201d is the way to describe CMU. It does, however, have a very \u201ccorporate\u201d feel, with a lot of the excitement linked to both the ties and opportunities with large, top-tier corporate employers, and also the many entrepreneurial and startup ventures to which CMU students, grads, and faculty are linked. This is not a bad thing if you\u2019re set on a CS career and want a vast array of opportunities where coming out of CMU\u2019s CS program will give you a foot in the door that even an Ivy like Columbia can\u2019t quite match.  However, if you\u2019re more of an intellectual-exploration, life-of-the-mind, four-year-in-an-academic-bubble kind of person, you may savor the experience at Columbia in a different way from what you\u2019d experience at CMU. Things are much more in silos at CMU (the whole BXA \u201cinterdisciplinary\u201d initiative notwithstanding - my impression when we visited was that this was a top-down mandate that a lot of the departments don\u2019t fully buy into)\u2026 which is fine if you like your silo - and the CS silo does indeed offer a state-of-the-art CS education that surpasses what you\u2019d get at Columbia.<br>It really depends what you want, and most of all how sure you are about CS. IMHO, the worst possible outcome here (still not tragic, but undesirable relative to the great options you have) would be to go to CMU and then decide that CS wasn\u2019t for you after all.  Of course you can get a fine education in almost any major at CMU, but for the most part Columbia would be a better choice for you if it weren\u2019t for CMU\u2019s preeminence in CS. If you went to CMU for CS and then changed your mind about the field, you could legitimately feel regretful that you passed up Columbia. If you\u2019re sure about CS and want to propel your CS career forward to the greatest possible extent, then go to CMU - you will find the music opportunities there, and find your tribe, and craft the college experience that you want.  If your heart is in a wide-ranging liberal arts education and you\u2019re just doing CS because you want an employment-worthy skill-set in the mix (but you might drop it if something you\u2019re more passionate about comes along), then Columbia may be the place for you.  (I have gotten both impressions, variously, at different points in your threads, so it\u2019s hard to tell where your head and heart really are.)<br>Setting-wise, sure, Pittsburgh is not NYC, but there are pros and cons to both and I wouldn\u2019t make this decision based on one city over the other. Both offer more than enough for as much of a rich, urban college experience as you want. The differences between the institutions themselves are more important.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mamaedefamilia</b><br><br>@deadgirl   I wrote a response and it got lost when this thread was merged.  In case it does not reappear, to summarize: CMU\u2019s core can be tailored to be more math/science/social science oriented than Columbia\u2019s.  Columbia also requires four semesters of foreign language and two of PE in addition to the humanities courses about which you are feeling some trepidation.<br>For what it\u2019s worth, one of my engineering parents went to Columbia many decades ago and still vividly remembers and appreciates the core for its breadth, exposure to canonical works outside the discipline, and the inculcation of writing skills.  However, your comments suggest that you want the freedom to dive deep rather and find a structure that requires breadth to be limiting, and perhaps even stifling.<br>Either will prepare you well for your chosen career path.  While there is really no bad choice, it sounds CMU might fit your academic preferences and goals better.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br><br><br><br> deadgirl:<br>\"\"<br>Financially, I haven\u2019t received my FA package from Columbia yet, but as long as it\u2019s around the same as Carnegie Mellon, it doesn\u2019t really matter.<br>\"\"<br><br>When will Columbia deliver the FA package?

CMU has a BREADTH similar to GaTech for research work and the very top research scientists. That does NOT make them better teachers.<br>The student body at Columbia and CMU is similar, but Columbia students may be a bit higher scoring and more diversity there too. Columbia is the more well rounded school, probably, although CMU is strong in business, and musical theatre too.  Engineering, probably about the same, actually, I don\u2019t care for CMU engineering as much as most people, EE is sort of strange there, and materials science is about the same at both schools.<br>For sciences, maybe Columbia is stronger actually than CMU, for physics say.  But they are roughly comparable for most undergraduate fields, with somewhat more strong techy students gravitating towards CMU.<br>The students are more well rounded and diverse at Columbia, with top English, philosophy and history  majors choosing Columbia.

So don\u2019t believe the people that say CMU is better across the board, it depends on the subfield.<br>I think the averaged rank for computer science is totally meaningless for undergrads, and also really for grad students, it all depends on exactly what you want to do inside of CS and since you don\u2019t know, a dart will suffice for choosing between these two, or other criteria like, your  favorite city.<br>Believe in yourself and choose the city you like.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Hasn\u2019t the fact that OP still hasn\u2019t committed to Columbia an indicator of reluctance to do so?
