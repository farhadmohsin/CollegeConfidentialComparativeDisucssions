These are going to be announced in the next week or two. My guess is you need an ACT of 34 or higher to have a good chance on these, but they give full-tuition at Tulane. Another factor to consider is how much dual enrollment and/or AP credit you have. The Alabama scholarship is for eight semesters, both graduate and undergraduate. The Tulane is for undergraduate only. So if you are starting college with a lot of college credits, this could be important.<br>I would scratch Wisconsin from your list. I just don\u2019t see it being worth the extra cost when compared to Tulane or Alabama.<br>The biggest pro for Alabama is that it is tuition free and the scholarship rolls over. They will also allow you to use the full amount of your scholarship for study abroad. So you can spend a summer or semester abroad and have $13,500 to spend towards expenses. Tulane also applies your scholarship to study abroad, but they charge full tuition and then they pay for the program. So you don\u2019t get a \u201ccheap\u201d semester by studying abroad.<br>Alabama has a mission to educate the average folks from in state, so their 25-75 ACT scores are 23-31 (SAT R490-610, M490-620); in other words one-fourth of the student body is brilliant, the next quartile reasonably smart, and the bottom half just bumbles along (Ole Miss has a similar distribution, probably with fewer smart students). Princeton Review ranks it #3 as having the Least Accessible Professors. It\u2019s a very big school, and I think it could be easy to get lost in the crowd. The dorms are extremely nice, and I think the food is supposed to be pretty good. In any given year you have a reasonable chance of playing for or being the national champion in football, if that\u2019s something you like.<br>Tulane has a 25-75 ACT score range of 29-33 (SAT, R620-710, M630-710), so you\u2019re dealing with a campus where everybody is pretty smart to brilliant. This can be good and bad when grubbing for grades. Princeton Review ranks Tulane #1 in the nation for community involvement; also #1 for hard liquor, #6 for best quality of life; #9 for party schools. Make of these what you will. As a practical matter, your chance of getting a minor in possession in New Orleans is virtually nil. It\u2019s illegal for 18-year-olds to buy alcohol, but if they are in a house with a bunch of alcohol it\u2019s perfectly legal for them to drink it. (So it\u2019s against the law to sell or give it to them, but they have the right to possess it!). On the down side, New Orleans can be a dangerous city. The Tulane campus is safe, but it\u2019s not necessarily wise to walk alone late at night, save perhaps to the streetcar stop. The dorms at Tulane are reportedly not as nice as those at Alabama, and I don\u2019t think Tulane has student recreation and weight facilities that are as nice as those at Alabama. Alabama has a stronger Greek system than Tulane; Tulane has lots of Greeks, but their Greek affiliation is less important than at Alabama.<br>I\u2019ve taken a lot of verbage to say all this, but if money is absolutely no object, I think I\u2019d be inclined to think Tulane would be the better choice for a political science major. With that said, you really need to visit both of these campuses. They are very different places and you shouldn\u2019t decide without visiting.

Look into it. Its pretty selective, but you sound like a potentially good candidate (criteria ares strict though --you need to be fluent in 2 languages, have taken around 12 APs, etc). Also, if you are a poli sci major, you can apply to  take a class with James Carville.  And his wife  Mary Matalin has been reported to pop in.

Alabama is a great school, and importantly, it\u2019s going to save you tens of thousands of dollars over the course of 4 years. You still get a high-quality education.

Lots of students don\u2019t have the option of studying abroad over the summer because it\u2019s prohibitively expensive.<br>If you\u2019d have to borrow the excess, this is a no-brainer - Alabama.

He has three years of high school German. He did not take AP German because he is taking a very tough college course this year (intermediate accounting). I told him if he was selected I would let him go to Germany for three or four weeks this summer in hopes that he might pick up a bit, although picking up German really isn\u2019t like picking up French or Spanish.<br>Anyway, I think he is going to enter Tulane with the maximum of 15 dual enrollment hours plus 15 or 18 AP hours, which turns the Master of Accountancy degree into a four-year plan.<br>@juillet People often mistype and refer to Alabama as offering a full ride when what it offers is automatic full tuition for anyone with a 32 ACT and 3.5 g.p.a. In rare instances Alabama gives additional scholarship money, but the free tuition is their thing and where they put all their money.<br>There are a lot of folks at Tulane who choose to pay half-tuition of about $25,000 rather than go to Alabama for free, so I wouldn\u2019t say the choice is a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d My son was offered $32,000 at Tulane, and we\u2019re giving serious thought to paying the $19,000 difference rather than take the free Alabama offer. We\u2019re also going to carefully consider Georgia with an OOS tuition waiver at $9,000 per year. In my opinion the three schools offer very different potential experiences and opportunities, and I\u2019m not out to just grab the lowest price \u2013 although that may very well be what we end up doing in the end.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Definitely worth checking out the Altman, @EarlVanDorn. One never knows who\u2019s applying and what they are looking for each year. If he is pretty fluent in German he should be a viable candidate. If he gets in you owe me a drink <br>I also agree with you that Georgia and Alabama are quite different from Tulane.  A student  will get a very different experience at Tulane than they would at UGA or Bama. If a student is considering business, they will have to apply to the Terry school of business at UGA in their sophomore year and there is no absolute guarantee they will get in. In contrast admission to Tulane it\u2019s an automatic admission to A.B. Free.<br>We are in state for Georgia but neither of my kids wanted a huge university experience and neither applied to UGA. Both were national merit finalists and Alabama called him and encouraged him to apply and take the full ride (not full tuition full ride) scholarship at Alabama. Again he wasn\u2019t interested in a big university, and for religious reasons it was not a strong competitor at the time either. So there are a lot of factors that go into these decisions. Certainly finances are a huge one but fortunately for some families it may not have to be the deciding factor. My younger son thought he wanted to go into medicine and was certainly sensitive to financial factors. Fortunately for him he got a full tuition scholarship (The full ride scholarships were not available at that time) at Tulane and that, combined with his national merit scholarship money, made Tulane cost us just a bit LESS than it would have cost for us to send him in state to UGA. Older son got into Georgia Tech (back then it was his safety school LOL) but also chose a smaller environment that was a better fit for him. Also back then, he was interested in physics, wanting to pursue practical physics, but the department at Tech was more theoretical which wasn\u2019t a good fit for him. Both of my sons ended up switching into engineering, and if younger son had been at UGA, back then they had no engineering so it would have been a bad fit, possibly requiring a transfer. So these are all important variables to consider when one makes the decision for the best option for themselves. So again these are all important factors in making decisions about the best school choices. Good luck to your son and his decision.<br>It seems the OP must have made their choice or taken a break. Would be curious about their thoughts. Agree with everyone that going into large debt (eg over 100k) is not a good idea for undergrad. But if families can allow their student  options that do not cause a financial pinch, so much the better.  And entering at the sophomore level (with AP/dual enrollment credits) helps with access to registration earlier, etc.as one registers with the class above them.<br>IIRC, Wisconsin is facing some financial issues these days. DH attended UW, so am familiar with it, though haven\u2019t been up to Madison recently. But have been reading about the  financial concerns there.

Of course debt free is much better!<br>Also, the curriculum for the Altman is pretty structured, IIRC, so even with all the incoming credits, if they don\u2019t fit easily into the program, the Masters degree might still be not doable in 4 years with the Altman.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EarlVanDorn</b><br><br>@jym626 You\u2019re on for the drink.<br>As I said, my son will be coming in with at least 33 credits, maybe more.

Money was THE most important factor in choosing a college, and most of us chose the place where we got a scholarship or that was in-state affordable because we had no other options. We learned to look at and think about reputation and prestige very broadly, too. Even though I\u2019m 30 now, and approaching my 10-year college reunion, I have yet to shake that upbringing. In fact, if anything, it\u2019s strengthened - my high school friends have gone on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, scientists, professors, and other great professions even though only one that I can remember off the top of my head went to a college in the top 50 (well, a large handful went to Georgia Tech, because I\u2019m from Georgia).<br>I suppose if I came from a wealthier family and/or a family where one or both of my parents attended college, I might have a different outlook. I\u2019m not saying that top colleges have no influence or experiences that might be worth more money - I went to Columbia for graduate school and worked with undergrads, so I saw the very stark differences in the resources they had access to (and that I had access to!) vs. what I had at my undergrad college (an excellent LAC in the top 100, but not top 50, of USNWR). There\u2019s a certain amount more I\u2019d be willing to pay for my own kids to attend a top college. I don\u2019t know what that amount is because it\u2019s all hypothetical because I have no kids, lol.<br>Still - $80-100K is a lot of money. And Alabama is an excellent school. I suppose I\u2019m just wondering what outcomes such families might think are worth the extra $80-100K. I don\u2019t necessarily think a Tulane graduate will earn $100K more over her lifetime than if she had gone to Alabama, or that there are $100K worth better career opportunities out of coming from Tulane. Even the fact that you have to apply for the business major isn\u2019t that big of a sway to me, mostly because students can major in a variety of fields and go into business.<br>And I\u2019m genuinely curious!

In rare instances Alabama gives additional scholarship money, but the free tuition is their thing and where they put all their money.<br>&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>Rare instances?  Lol.  There are over 700 NMF students at Bama with much more than just free tuition.  And there are 1000s there with add\u2019l dept awards stacking with their tuition awards.<br><br>[QUOTE=\"\"]<br>\"\"<br>\"\"<br>There are a lot of folks at Tulane who choose to pay half-tuition of about $25,000 rather than go to Alabama for free, so I wouldn't say the choice is a \"no-brainer.\" My son was offered $32,000 at Tulane, and we're giving serious thought to paying the $19,000 difference rather than take the free Alabama offer. We're also going to carefully consider Georgia with an OOS tuition waiver at $9,000 per year. In my opinion the three schools offer very different potential experiences and opportunities, and I'm not out to just grab the lowest price -- although that may very well be what we end up doing in the end.<br>\"\"<br>\"\"<br>[/QUOTE]<br><br>Sure, there may be some folks at Tulane doing that.  There are folks at Alabama paying full or near freight rather than grab their HOPE or Bright Futures awards for a Florida, GA or Tenn school.  It happens.  Usually due to student choice and affluent parents willing to spend the extra bucks.  It\u2019s not really a statement on their cheaper schools.<br>$80k more for Tulane?  For Accountancy?  If you\u2019re fine with than, then super!  Necessary for accountancy?  No, not at all.<br>Alabama\u2019s Accountacy ranking:  Ranked 8th best Accounting program in the nation by the 2015 Public Accounting Report, Masters and Ph.D. are both ranked 9th<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>If a student is paying full or near full freight at Alabama and did not meet criteria for much or any automatic scholarship money at UA, they probably did  not meet the requirement for HOPE or Zell Miller at UGA or bright futures at UF.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>That edited incorrectly above. Should say  a student not qualifying for automatic tuition discounts at UA probably didn\u2019t qualify for the GA or FL in state merit awards.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mom2collegekids</b><br><br>I don\u2019t think the Hope and BF awards (tuition discounts) require that high of stats (high enough to get 1/2-full OOS tuition awards at Bama).<br>I was talking to a FL mom whose child did qualify for BF (dont know which level), but only got half tuition at Bama.  So, her costs are much higher than if she had gone to a FL school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mom2collegekids</b><br><br>Is this still true for the larger Zell?<br><br>[QUOTE=\"\"]<br>\"\"<br>\"\"<br>A Zell Miller Scholarship recipient must graduate from high school with a minimum 3.7 grade point average combined with a minimum SAT score of 1,200 on the math and reading portions or a minimum composite ACT score of 26 in single national test administration and maintain a minimum 3.3 cumulative postsecondary grade ...<br>\"\"<br>\"\"<br>[/QUOTE]<br><br>If so, then a GA student could get full tuition Zell and get nothing from Bama.<br>An OOS student needs at least an ACT 30 to essentially come close to rivaling what they\u2019d net pay at their home school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Yes, the Zell requires a 3.7 and a minimum SAT/GPA . So yes, scholarship money available for instate students is frequently a lower bar than for OOS students. At UA an instate student needs only an ACT of 24 or new SAT of 1160 (1090 on the old SAT) and GPA of 3.0 to be eligible for scholarship consideration.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mom2collegekids</b><br><br>Right\u2026but we\u2019re talking about GA, Tenn, FL students giving up their instate Zell, HOPE, Bright Futures to attend an OOS public that costs significantly more.<br>It\u2019s surprising, but it happens a lot.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Does it happen as often in the reverse? Would think it likely happens both ways. Are there programs/majors offering tuition reciprocity?<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>Bright Futures requires a 26 or a 29 on the ACT depending on coverage.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Right- exactly.  People give up discount instate tuition for higher priced oos or private school tuition all the time. Thst is the point.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EarlVanDorn</b><br><br>@mom2collegekids Mom2college is absolutely correct that Alabama has generous National Merit scholarships, and I failed to mention these. Alabama and Oklahoma compete to see who can get the most National Merit scholars, and both schools offer a very good package that substantially exceeds full tuition. I wasn\u2019t thinking about that package when I made my comment. With that said, Alabama offers very few scholarships over and above the free tuition to non NMF students. Ole Miss, which attracts far fewer NMF but gives a similar NMF scholarship, ends up giving out a lot of academic scholarships over and above tuition to those who don\u2019t reach NMF status, as do a number of other schools. This was not intended to criticize Alabama, which has an amazing number of merit scholars.<br>I agree with you that Alabama has a very good accounting school, as does Ole Miss and Georgia. But I do think it\u2019s possible that Tulane might be worth $80,000 more than Alabama, or that Georgia might be worth $36,000 more than Alabama, or, if my son should get an Ole Miss full ride, that Alabama might be worth $40,000 than Ole Miss. There are some factors involved beyond just the accounting degree. We\u2019re just going to visit every campus again and make up our mind before May comes around.<br><br>"]}
