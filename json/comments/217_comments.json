{"title": "full ride at upitt vs full tuition at vanderbilt", "comments": ["<b>Username: ChilliLL</b><br><br>Hello,<br>I need some help deciding which college I should pick. Back in December, I was awarded a full ride covering tuition, room and board, etc as well as a $500 book award and $2000 study abroad grant. Because of this, Pitt has been my top choice ever since and I couldn\u2019t imagine any of the elite schools giving me money off. However, yesterday, I received a letter saying I was a Chancellor\u2019s scholar at Vanderbilt giving me full tuition and $5000 to study abroad. I was thrilled but my decision has become a lot harder. I would still have to pay another $15000 for room and board at vanderbilt, but I like the idea of going to vanderbilt more. I am visiting both schools soon so I don\u2019t have that experience yet.

You don\u2019t have to short change yourself because you are younger. (You sound like the youngest they always carry the burden of financial guilt after seeing all that is spent on the older siblings.)

Congrats to you!<br><br>", "<b>Username: TooOld4School</b><br><br>I normally bow to the wisdom of @mom2collegekids , but Vanderbilt is definitely worth the extra $15K/yr, as long as you do not cause financial hardship for your family.

What more could you ask for?<br><br>", "<b>Username: ChilliLL</b><br><br>Thanks for your inputs @TooOld4School @blueskies2day ! Yeah, my parents can certainly afford it, and I\u2019m hoping to earn a few outside scholarships to even further reduce the cost.

Significant weeding can just mean that A\u2019s and B\u2019s are very limited, with many students getting by with Cs.<br>Vandy can be a grinder for premeds.  My nephew was premed there. He had been a top student at his prep school, but soon did not have a med-school-worthy GPA.  It\u2019s been a frustration since his family was full pay and they thought that the Vandy name would somehow carry him to med school.<br>That said, I don\u2019t think Pitt will be some cake-walk\u2026lol.

They should be your primary resources in this decision process,<br>Throughout life, your goal will not be to always minimize cost.  Sometimes things that cost more will provide a greater return.  That can include the college you attend.  All schools are not equal and some will fit you better and help provide a better outcome.<br>Perhaps also if cost is a concern you can agree with your parents to have skin in the game and take student loans for $26,000 over the four years, effectively covering half of the cost difference between schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: carachel2</b><br><br>Congrats! You have some amazing opportunities.

My father is a physician and he said he is willing to help fund my education.<br>@mommdc I was thinking that I don\u2019t cash in many of my AP credits so I can retake the equivalent courses in college so I will have a rock solid understanding of the subject, be ahead in the class, and hopefully do well in these classes to help boost my GPA.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ChilliLL</b><br><br>@carachel2 I haven\u2019t asked my parents specifically how much they will fund for medical school, but my brother is currently in medical school and my parents are only partially funding him, so he currently has some debt<br><br>", "<b>Username: carachel2</b><br><br>Hmmm. That would definitely be something I would bring up! If taking the full ride means they will fund more $$ of medical school and you would have less debt then that\u2019s something to consider.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mommdc</b><br><br>Yes, it\u2019s fine if you want to take Gen Chem 1 and 2 and Gen Bio 1 and 2. And med schools might expect you to take certain prerequisites in college, not from AP credit.<br>But you might still be able to use some of the other credits for English, Calc, History and Econ, and create some flexibility in your schedule, to study abroad, maybe pursue some additional interests.<br>Your advisor can help with that.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mom2collegekids</b><br><br>&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>Vandy\u2019s premed acceptance rate is 66 percent.

You can pull the total number of applicants from the following table. Note that this includes re-applicants, which in Vanderbilt\u2019s case increased the total of applicants from the 180 first-time applicants.<br>https://www.aamc.org/download/321458/data/factstablea2-7.pdf<br>Vanderbilt  - 280 applicants from an undergrad of 6,880 or 4.1%.<br>WashU - 393 applicants from an undergrad of 7,500 or 5.2%.<br>Notre Dame - 277 applicants from an undergrad of 8,450 or 3.3%.<br>Judging from the above and assuming that each schools starts out with the same percentage of premeds, ND seems to be restricting applicants the most, and WashU the least.<br>BTW, Pitt had 283 applicants, but I did not find anything about their success rate.<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>Agree with @mom2collegekids  From what I have gathered some colleges will recommend all interested students for med school (group 1) and other colleges will go through a pre-approval process and only recommend students who they feel have a solid chance at being accepted (group 2).  So while a school in group 1 may have a lower acceptance rate to med school, the college could actually have better overall results. Without knowing exactly what is in the numerator and denominator of any ratio the statistics and comparisons between schools are not all that valuable.<br>@Zinhead I don\u2019t think I would judge it form the total undergrad population.  For example ND has quite a large business school   (over 2000 undergrads I believe) compared to 0 undergraduate business students at Vandy which may well mean that ND has a smaller percentage of undergraduates interested in med school.  IMO you would need to find out how many students start off pre-med and how may eventually go to med school (which I\u2019m guessing would be an impossible task).<br><br>", "<b>Username: mom2collegekids</b><br><br>@Zinhead Thanks for the data\u2026<br>I still don\u2019t think that indicates anything \u201cbad\u201d about Vandy.<br>What are the links for the ND and Washu rates?<br>These published rates can be so confusing.  Some schools include DO schools in their reporting %'s.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Zinhead</b><br><br>@mom2collegekids - I don\u2019t have links, but do remember that both schools claimed an 80+ percent acceptance rate when we visited.<br><br>", "<b>Username: akiddoc</b><br><br>I don\u2019t know how this is even up for debate. Unless you hate the culture at Vandy - which is possible - go there. Med schools are much more likely to take kids from big name private schools. That\u2019s just a fact. Premed admission rates are useless. You don\u2019t know who is in the denominator. But I can tell you who is in the numerator.<br>When presented with a kid with a 3.9 from Pitt or a 3.6 from Vandy, who do you think med school admission comittees are inclined to take? The Vandy kid. I went to one of those big name private schools and I had a huge advantage in med school admissions. I had a ridiculous number of choices. It probably isn\u2019t fair, but that is the way it is. I know a kid who recently got into a solid med school with a 3.15 from Stanford. Great published research, high MCAT, bad grades.<br>Most of the top end med schools are not impressed with Bio majors. They\u2019re a dime a dozen. I double majored in Bio and Philosophy. The only thing my interviewers wanted to talk about was the Philosophy major. They know you have taken the premed courses. They know your grades in those courses. They are more interested in whether you can think outside the box. I shouldn\u2019t have bothered finishing the Bio major. I should have studied abroad for a quarter instead.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mommdc</b><br><br>Never mind<br><br>", "<b>Username: hzhao2004</b><br><br>Personally, I believe Vandy is worth $15k over Pitt.<br><br>", "<b>Username: itsgettingreal17</b><br><br>@hzhao2004  Herein lies a big problem I have with such advice.

I wouldn\u2019t be lured by a free ride since Vandy is affordable. The resources at your disposal will be much greater there, as will support and opportunities.

To some families, $15 k per year is really just pennies, but to others it is a lot of money that makes a difference in what they have to sacrifice to pay it.  If the $15k doesn\u2019t have much impact on your family\u2019s lifestyle or cause them to make much sacrifice, I would go to Vandy \u2013 BUT ONLY IF UPON HAVING VISITED BOTH INCLUDING SAT IN ON AT LEAST ONE CLASS AT BOTH, you clearly feel you fit better and prefer Vandy.  If, on the other hand, it represents a financial impact that they will really feel, then I would go to Pitt.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hzhao2004</b><br><br>@itsgettingreal17 That\u2019s why I qualified my statement by \u201cpersonally\u201d.
