Just because in-state students have lower test scores than OOS students does not mean they are any less academically inclined. Most in-state applicants/students at Michigan do not spend nearly as much time preparing for those standardized tests as OOS applicants/students. The paradigm is completely different. In-state students, for the most part, do not look beyond the University of Michigan. It is their end game. They know that as long as are among the top students in their respective high school classes, they have a good shot of getting into Michigan. As such, they hardly prepare for the ACT/SAT. If you do end up at Michigan, I would caution you against underestimating your classmates. They may have slightly lower test scores, but they did not invest as much time preparing for those tests. In the case of Michigan, having a slightly lower standardized test score average does not mean its student body is of a lower calibre.<br><br>", "<b>Username: eyemgh</b><br><br>You're in for a rude awakening if you feel like engineering will be any less than challenging...anywhere.

I simply cannot authoritative confirm that it applies to Michigan or Carnegie Mellon.<br><br>You have read innumerable posts on CC that focus on post-Bachelor's INITIAL career placement and the perceived benefits of university quality/stature. This really is inapplicable to someone like you, who will attend Duke, Michigan, or CMU. Yes, you'll obviously have to find an entry-level position (presumably in a highly sought-after enterprise). However, with an undergraduate engineering degree from any of these three institutions (and presuming decent academic performance) I can assure you that will not be a problem.<br><br>Because you will be a graduate from one of these highly reputed universities, you can afford to look forward a decade of more -- your major challenges will not be at the entry-level, but rather at the entry/mid SUPERVISORY/LEADERSHIP level. Let me explain why:<br>- Most major/large engineering and program management organizations (I based this on 40+ years experince in this business, 20+ with Lockheed Martin) soon (in about 5 years, +/- a couple) informally \"earmark\" fast-track employees.<br>- They are quickly identified and placed in the most critical projects, offered subsidized to pursue advanced education (frequently MBAs), and sent to corporate/enterprise internal \"charm schools.\"<br>- While alumni from any reputable school are identified and selected, a hugely disproportionate share come from the first-tier educational institutions (especially considering how small the aggregate numbers of graduates from these \"elite\" schools actually are).<br>- A degree from Duke (CMU and Michigan, perhaps . . . I just don't know with certainty) is a very significant plus in quickly clearing this crucial initial hurdle, one that essentially guarantees you'll move quickly upward (critically, no firm will pay MANY thousands of dollars to \"groom\" a youngster -- postgraduate school, internal training, special job assignments -- and then deny their own, costly selection by failing to promote that individual).<br><br>Once an individual is established in mid/upper-manaagement, the university's OVERALL reputation is FAR more critical than the stature of the engineering, or business, or public policy, etc. school, per se. Many most-senior public and private officials/leaders -- even in engineering and programmatic enterprises -- do NOT have technical backgrounds (many are MBAs or JDs), and they could not tell you if, for example, Ohio State's engineering school (or any subdivisions therein) is good, average or poor. HOWEVER, they certainly will know -- and signifiantly appreciate -- Duke is a superior university (again, I do not doubt they would feel that U of M and CMU are, too, I simply cannot substantiate this).<br><br>Allied with the foregoing, it's noteworthy that MANY young Pratt graduates opt for major -- and quite lucrative -- non-engineering opportunities in iBanking, consulting, business, and so forth. I believe this is noteworthy because the job marketplace views Pratt alumni so highly that they are not initially limited to \"pure engineering\" positions. That's a substantial advantage . . . and it is also very instructive. How true this is with just-graduated CMU and U of M BSEs, I do not know; but I suspect that \"telling\" data would be readily available from the schools' placement offices.<br><br>I'll close with one caveat: my post is focused on large public and private enterprises, not on smaller ones. Obviously, due to the stupendous capital (and other) resource requirements necessary to complete large engineering programs with success, many young BSEs will enter such organizations (however, some will also go to small, often entrepreneurial enterprises).\"\"<br><br>", "<b>Username: eyemgh</b><br><br>You can indeed post this question in the engineering forum, and if you want valid opinions of practicing and hiring engineers, you absolutely should.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>I firmly believe that the university matters much more than the major at the undergraduate level.

This was strange to me because like most OOS students, I worked hard on my SAT preparation. That is why I said that there is a fundamental difference in paradigm to consider when comparing test scores at public universities and private universities. As it is, I am not sure if anybody can differentiate between a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA and an average SAT/ACT of 1410/31.5 and a student body that graduated from high school with a 3.9 unweighted GPA having taken similar classes, and an average SAT/ACT of 1480/33.
