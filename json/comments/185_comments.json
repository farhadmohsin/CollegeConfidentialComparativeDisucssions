Can you give any specific reasons why you would pick Georgetown over BC? BC has been my first choice for over a year probably.

Washington is pretty hard to beat. There\u2019s so much history, and there is tons of stuff to do. At BC, you\u2019re pretty far away from downtown, so you won\u2019t have a ton of opportunities to go downtown. It\u2019s about two hours from Boston. Georgetown is literally eight minutes from the White House. Personally, I believe that the education at Georgetown will exceed BC.

We have the same choices but admitted students day(s) pushed it clearly to Boston College. Facilities. The vibe of the kids and smiles. Commitment to core and core renewal was excellent. My D is a premed and total STEM focus. Having a commitment to liberal arts for all as part of the educational process is important to her.  No wrong choices here for you.  USNWR has Gtown at 20 and BC 30.  Forbes and elsewhere are similar. BCs business school is even better. PreMed counseling center is better at BC in our opinion as well.

It just said \u201cGeorgetown Scholarship\u201d for part of the award. If you have not already contacted your individual financial aid POC, I would do so now to make sure that your package is in process. The financial aid POC was great, and told us when a decision has been made and when to expect it.  There are listings by last name on the web site.

They advised us that they do not consider scholarships awarded from other universities.
