Net prices are\u2026 USC: 16k UA: 5k (scores qualified)  UCLA: 20k. In terms of the offerings, it seems USC offers more based off of multimedia, but UCLA is ranked high for research as well. Alabama would allow me to do my own research at an undergraduate level, which is HUGE for me.

The answer is yes to all your questions. Alabama is offering a NMF scholarship. USC is also allowing a trustee because of grades and connections. I am not sure about Stanford right now, but I come from a very low income family that, for their financial aid coverage, would cover full tuition (possibly?).

So I did the price calculator for Stanford and the projection for what I would contribute is 2.2k! What a great price! I have decided, based on the responses and long thought, to drop out UCLA and Alabama, as it doesn\u2019t seem like the right fit. Now it all comes down to Stanford and USC. For those who might contribute to this answer, please let me answer what I am looking for. Between USC and Stanford, I want the best one for Electrical Engineering, but it doesn\u2019t have to be the highest ranked. See, they are very close in ranking, but I want to go to the program that allows me to do the best research, collaborate with companies and partners, and really big for me, make my own projects. If I can have the resources to build, that would be awesome! The areas I am interested in pertain to Virtual Reality and Flexible Electronics. I would love to do some research in those areas. Lastly, I want a college that is a blast. I want to be able to go to sporting events (huge sports fan btw), hang out with some great, social people, and really find a home where I am at. My family is from Louisiana, so I would love to have the LSU Tigers fun to it but with amazing academics <br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>UPDATE: USC has dropped to approximately 4k.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mom2aphysicsgeek</b><br><br>@lukebenoit4 That is putting the cart before the horse.  You need to be accepted to Stanford before you start trying to decide between the 2.  Wait for a week and then if it is an option, ask people to help you discern.<br>You didn\u2019t answer the question about the $11,000 gap.

It might help other students facing similar decisions if you could share what you did and didn\u2019t like about the school when you saw it in person.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>@Mom2aphysicsgeek First off, there\u2019s nothing to not like about Alabama. The campus is beautiful, and the people are amazing. However, when I went to USC, it seems like USC is the future school while Alabama seems to be a good school. In other words, it didn\u2019t seem very entrepreneurial and the university isnt as \u201cconnected\u201d to companies like Stanford and USC are. With that said, saying no to Alabama was extremely hard. When I first met the counselors, I had never felt so wanted and so happy to talk to a school. It blew me out of the water. They especially got my mother\u2019s attention too when they mentioned having the biggest Starbucks in the nation <br>Anyways, I just think if Alabama wants to become part of the \u201cprestige\u201d category, they are going to need more companies around them and more advance research.<br>Hope that helps<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mom2aphysicsgeek</b><br><br>@lukebenoit4 Clueless about the Starbucks.  Never heard that before.  But I find your perspective interesting. Your OP asks about discerning about CBH, yet the only mention of CBH is about talking to a recruiter about the program.  There is no mention about CBH itself, CBHers, CBH UG research, the engineering facilities, or mentoring faculty.<br>Not sure why anyone who is interested in prestige would apply to Bama.  But, considering they just spent $300 million building new engineering facilities, it is hard to fathom them not focused on the future.<br>But, no, Bama is not Stanford. Nor is it USC.  And USC doesn\u2019t just drop $12,000 overnight for everyone.  That is a huge blessing. So there is no question that for $4000 you should choose USC.  You shouldn\u2019t even need your brother\u2019s help.  You can just take out your federal student loans.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>@Mom2aphysicsgeek  yes! When the recruiters came to my school, the CBH program was what they were really selling me on. But when I went to campus, it seemed like it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal which is strange. As far as the engineering facilities, they are nice, but I thought USC had the nicer buildings believe it or not. Even better than Stanford in my opinion. And thank you! I sent a very encouraging email a while back telling them a little more about my personal side and USC has been very helpful. The awesome thing is, before I even have started, I have met some amazing professors. The CEO of the company I am interning with is good friends with Robert Hernandez. He\u2019s a very prestigious professor over there at SC so I look forward to seeing him in person this April!<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>My grandfather is a very devoted Texas man and he has been pushing me for UT Austin and Texas A and M for a while. He is now telling me that I should do USC as well,.

It seems like you have great connections, and USC is the obvious choice.<br>You don\u2019t just visit campus for CBH. It isn\u2019t discussed in general bc the freshman class is approx 7000 and only 40 kids are accepted.<br>And, wow, I am so impressed with your parents.  You managed to visit a lot of schools a long way away for a very low income student.  That must have been hard on their budget.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>Decision is coming April 2nd!

If you are in the Honors College building, CBH has its own space, its own lab, its own staff.  The Dean of the Honors College teaches sophomore to senior CBH, knows each student individually and assists them with life advice, internships and job placements.

The money that is being spent at UA in buildings, research, and student scholarships is second to none in the US.   Does this mean prestige?  No.  Does this mean opportunities that are hard to find at other schools?  Absolutely.  However, if you want to live on the West Coast, and stay on the West Coast for your career, select USC or UCLA.

I\u2019ve felt the exact same way about the CBH program. I told you that. The program is amazing and does not disappoint, but I felt like if I wanted to work out in California I should go to USC, UCLA, or Stanford. That\u2019s why I posted this whole thread to hear how the CBH program might compare to these schools.

I am not attcking you, but your posts are confusing and make no sense. You asked about choosing UA bc of CBH, but your posts about CBH do not sound like CBH is an actual option. It is why I have asked if you were accepted as a finalist. You said that when you visited campus, it didn\u2019t seem like CBH was a big deal, and \u201cI am also very busy with my studies and finishing up on this year, so I might not know everything about the programs except what I hear from counselors or what is on their main websites. I hope you understand what I am saying.\u201d<br>If CBH were an option, you would have been flown in for a special finalist weekend where about 50 kids are brought in for 40 spots.  You would have spent 3 days on campus interviewing, meeting other candidates and current CBHers, meeting with faculty mentors, and hearing presentations about what CBH offers and what grads from CBH are currently doing.  It would not be information from counselor\u2019s or their website.<br>It sounds like a USC is your best option at this point.

I am actually a sophomore right now, but I have a 32 on my ACT and a 1450 on my SAT and applied for these schools and got an offer from SC and Stanford. Ive met some people at these schools and they told me I should apply to get an offer and boom! Still waiting on Stanford (April 1st)<br>Ok so here\u2019s the thing about Alabama. I met with some people at Alabama and they told me about the CBH program but I did not get to see everything about it. So that\u2019s why I am asking if it should even be an option right now. I was told by Alabama counselors that I would have a VERY HIGH chance of getting accepted based on my resume.<br>Yes, I am a sophomore. I have been taking junior and  senior level classes and I actually could graduate early believe it or not cause of everything I have.

I suspected you were not a sr and that you had not been accepted into CBH. It is why I kept trying to get you to clarify.<br>In terms of believing you could graduate as a sophomore, you should not underestimate posters on CC. My ds at Bama did not graduate early bc we don\u2019t believe in early graduation.  But he was advanced enough that he took a 400 level electromagnetic wave theory class his freshman yr at Bama. So, parents on here know that advanced kids exist.<br>Other parts of your posts demonstrate equal lack of understanding of the process as the CBH comments. (No, you cannot just show them your resume and get accepted into the program.)<br>I would recommend you post the wording of your actual offers so people can help you determine if your understanding of the offers are the same as what you have actually received.

For example, one of my friends is doing an online program at Stanford because she\u2019s finished out math like I will this year. I am hoping to see if I could do a dual enrollment of calculus classes at USC since they said Calculus is key (I\u2019ll have Calc I and II done this year).

By misrepresenting yourself, the logical response to you now is to come back in a yr and ask when you have grown up. I knew you were lying bc nothing fit true application outcome scenarios.   (No one has a convenient drop in costs  of $11,000 overnight. UCs are pretty much unaffordable to all OOS students.  Visiting colleges on the other side of the country is expensive and very low income families really struggle with being able to afford visits.)<br>Fwiw, you lack a solid grasp on the college admissions process.  People telling you should apply and actually being accepted with large scholarships and/or into extremely competitive programs are 2 completely different things.

I will next time I promise<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>Thank you<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mom2aphysicsgeek</b><br><br>@lukebenoit4 It is impossible that you were \u201cpresented\u201d with NMF for multiple reasons. First you are a 10th grader.  NMF  is based on 11th grade PSAT scores. Second, cut-offs are determined by the National Merit Corp by state based on the students taking the test that yr.  You won\u2019t know if you qualify for NMSF until Dec of your jr yr and won\u2019t know if you progress to NMF until your sr yr.  UA has nothing to do with the designation. If you receive it and if they are still offering the same scholarship in 2 yrs time, THEN and only then will you know that you have received the NMF scholarship.<br>You are taking people\u2019s comments about possibilities as if they are factual offers\u2026  It does not work that way and you are spinning fairy tales about what you \u201chave.\u201d It is all fiction until you have it confirmed in writing from the school along with an acceptance and the financial aid package. Asnof right now, you have nothing but a couple of test scores.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenJenJenJen</b><br><br>@Mom2aphysicsgeek I applaud your patience.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>@Mom2aphysicsgeek then what did I receive? IM going to talk to my academic counselor tomorrow. This has all brought my confidence down and I am confused on where I stand.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mom2aphysicsgeek</b><br><br>@JenJenJenJen I think we have found the poster child for all of the UChicago mailings and why they worked in increasing their selectivity.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>@Mom2aphysicsgeek sorry I am new to all this. That\u2019s why I am asking for your help.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grtd2010</b><br><br>FYI, Not all NMSF/NMFs  are  automatically admitted to USC. The bar for admission is different than NMSC\u2019s standard for NMF selection. You can not have many grades with B\u2019s and C\u2019s during high school. DD is a NMF and has been admitted to USC.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>@grtd2010 There is not a single grade, as of now, with an A- on my transcript. I have perfect grades. If I knew how to post a picture, I would definitely show that.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>I would like to end this thread please. I want to message some of you questions I have, and I will be doing that. I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: psywar</b><br><br>@lukebenoit4<br><br>\"\"<br>Yes, I am a sophomore. I have been taking junior and senior level classes and I actually could graduate early believe it or not cause of everything I have. So I want to get ahead and be ready to go.<br>I am so sorry if it got confused or said something wrong. I am just looking for advice!<br>\"\"<br><br>My advice is to consider dropping this account and get yourself a new CC account and start over. You are clearly an intelligent, but very young person that got very excited and misrepresented your situation.<br>Once you have your new account, I\u2019d practice active listening and talking less. The smartest people I know listen far more than they talk. Your desire for information on these schools and programs is a wonderful thing, but you have burned through people\u2019s patience and harmed your credibility.<br>Schools\u2026<br>My son looked at the schools and programs. He, like you, was very impressed with USC\u2019s equipment and buildings, but less so with some of the professors who were too research and outward focused in his option, he wanted professors that wanted to teach too.<br>If you get into Stanford, the brand and opportunities (for what your interests are) would be too good to pass up IMO. Having grown up 10 min from Stanford\u2019s gorgeous campus, I can tell the weather is just about perfect.<br>Also, let me put in a good word for UA\u2019s CBH. I was incredibly impressed by the quality of professors my son met, who are devoted to teaching / guiding / mentoring the CBH kid. The money / support / dorms / access / labs the CBH kids have rival USC. Living in Austin (with good in-state tuition schools like UT), it would be hard for us to justify sending our kids to UA, but if one of our kids got a CBH offer, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a second.<br>In the end, my son chose Princeton\u2019s undergraduate-focused program (he got in SCEA), so he had to turn down the offer to fly out for the CBH finalist weekend, and attend USC\u2019s Trustee interview at Explore. He was waitlisted at Stanford.<br>Good luck,<br>Psy<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>Wow @psywar , thank you so much! I really appreciate your encouraging post.<br><br>", "<b>Username: menloparkmom</b><br><br>then what did I receive?<br>\"only marketing material to encourage you to apply to USC. just like tens of thousands of students with PSAT scores like yours.<br>period.<br>full stop.<br>Its actually good for you that your eyes have been opened  to the truth so early in the admissions \u201cgame\u201d<br>you\u2019re welcome.<br>now go back to work and continue to get great grades, high standardized  tests scores, and continue your EC\u2019s and come back here to CC late next year with your  PSAT score. from your Jr year.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lukebenoit4</b><br><br>@menloparkmom not going to lie, it\u2019s an evil game. Haha. I will for sure and I will make sure I make a new account as well for a \u201cstart over\u201d. Despite it being sort of discouraging, I appreciate you and @Mom2aphysicsgeek opening my eyes a little bit. It hurts, but it\u2019s a good hurt cause I will work harder than ever before. I look forward to talking to you soon!<br><br>", "<b>Username: skieurope</b><br><br>Closed at OP\u2019s request.<br><br>"]}
