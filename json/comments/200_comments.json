{"title": "carleton vs amherst", "comments": ["<b>Username: csdad2</b><br><br>We\u2019re faced with a bit of an unexpected situation.  Our son, who I had posted about before, applied to schools this year, with a focus on LACs.  He had some very good choices, and ended up selecting Carleton.  He did end up on a few waitlists, though, at some schools he really liked (Williams, Pomona, Amherst).  And yesterday he heard from one of them, Amherst, and they offered him admission.  He\u2019s got a couple days to think it over and decide.  So, we\u2019re looking for advise, comments that might help us pick between these two schools.<br>Some particular relevant topics:<br>He plans to study Physics (and go on to grad school).  The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations.  My impression is that Carleton\u2019s Physics program is stronger than Amherst\u2019s.<br>The general campus atmosphere: My son prefers an open, collaborative, diverse, somewhat laid-back environment.<br>The kind of students who go there: To give an idea, one thing he really liked about Carleton, in a survey asking students what word they\u2019d use to describe students there, \u201cquirky\u201d was the top choice (at another school, it was \u201chipster\u201d, which he didn\u2019t care for).<br>We often hear about the prominence of athletics at schools like Amherst (and Williams).  Just how much is this the case there, and how would it affect someone not active in athletics?  (My son played soccer in high school, also some ultimate and tennis, but he is not at a level to play on a college team.)<br>The study abroad program<br>We\u2019re in Illinois, and one of my son\u2019s preferences is to get out of the midwest.  (I\u2019m from the east coast originally, and still have family there.)<br>Amherst\u2019s endowment is quite a bit larger \u2013 does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools?<br>Financial aid: Amherst\u2019s aid is \u201cno loan\u201d.  Does that mean we can\u2019t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to?  And if we can, would it be on top of the grant they\u2019ve already given us, or would it displace some of it?  (Their website seems to suggest the former; I plan to speak with their FA office tomorrow.)  With the loan, the FA packages are very similar.<br>FWIW, we\u2019re of course not counting on any of the other waitlists coming through, but including those other schools, I\u2019d say that my son\u2019s liking preference is Williams &gt; Pomona &gt; Amherst &gt; Carleton; and my estimate of the quality of the Physics programs is Williams &gt; Carleton &gt; Amherst &gt; Pomona.<br>Interestingly, I feel that deciding between these two schools now is more difficult than the initial decision for Carleton!<br>Thanks!<br><br>", "<b>Username: OHMomof2</b><br><br>Congratulations! Amherst will not include loans in your aid package but you can take as much as you want up to the direct loan max, to help with your family or student contribution, for example.<br>D is not an athlete, loves her school, had an active social life that includes athletes and musicians and artists.<br>The ultimate team there was the first one ever, and it is a club sport with two level teams so if he wants to play he can.<br>Study abroad\u2026 Main thing to know is cost/financial aid is the same on campus or away. So he can choose whatever.<br>D\u2019s academic experience has not felt competitive to her at all.

The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations. My impression is that Carleton\u2019s Physics program is stronger than Amherst\u2019s.<br>\"\"<br><br>Carleton is commonly regarded as one of the more STEM-oriented LACs, while Amherst is sometimes regarded as less STEM-focused.<br>You can determine the percentage of STEM majors at a LAC by adding up the relevant numbers (for computer science, engineering if offered, biology, math, and physical sciences) in Section J of the Common Data Set. For these two schools, I get:<br>Carleton: 40.2 % STEM, 12.1 % physical sciences specifically<br>Amherst: 26.6 % STEM, 5.1 % physical sciences specifically<br>So there does appear to be more interest in STEM, and in physical sciences particularly, at Carleton. There is some suspicion that \u201copen curriculum\u201d schools (such as Amherst) attract a disproportionate number of science/math-phobes (because they can avoid taking any classes in these fields). In recent years, there has some concern about the aging of the Amherst science facilities, but a brand new science center is under construction, and is scheduled to open in Fall 2018.<br>I\u2019m sure you can get a great undergraduate physics education at Amherst. However, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if there are more physics faculty and a broader variety of physics courses at Carleton. You could review the college catalogs to see. Note, however, that Amherst students also have access to the 5-College Consortium, which could increase the range of physics course options, most likely at UMass.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ThankYouforHelp</b><br><br>Congrats!   Carleton is a great school.  No bad choices here.  Amherst is collaborative, not competitive.  It has a lot of athletes, but it also has a lot of artsy types.   The study abroad program is excellent and easily available to all students, including those on financial aid.<br>Carleton is strong in physics, but Amherst is strong in physics as well (and so is Williams).   All three are among the top dozen colleges in the country in the percentage of their graduates who go on to get PhDs in physics (Pomona is not).<br>Amherst is the most ethnically diverse top tier LAC, with 47 percent of the student body being persons of color.  It also is the most economically diverse LAC (along with Vassar).  A full quarter of the Amherst class is on Pell Grants, which means lower income students on full rides.  Carleton has about half that.  Not sure how much those things matter to you.<br>In addition, be aware that Amherst is building a spectacular new science center which will open at the end of your son\u2019s freshman year.<br>https://www.amherst.edu/offices/facilities/depts/designconst/capital_project/current_projects/science-center<br><br>", "<b>Username: SwimDad99</b><br><br>You\u2019ve gotten some great responses here. The fact is \u2013 there\u2019s now way to screw this up. Both spectacular choices. Carleton definitely has its strengths and is, by reputation, probably the best LAC in the entire Midwest. Amherst is maybe the best in the country or certainly among the top two or three. Purely on reputation, I\u2019d give Amherst a small but not insignificant edge. Also, keep in mind the Five College Consortium and those additional resources at hand with Amherst.<br>But if Carleton is stronger in physics, then that\u2019s certainly reason enough to go there instead. Again, no wrong choices here.<br>Good luck with your tough decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@csdad2 - Congratulations to your son! My D has decided to go to Carleton (from warm California). She is also interested in STEM and we found Carleton to have one of the strongest programs, among other things. If your son\u2019s goal is to get out of the Midwest, I think discussing your topics is a moot point. Both schools offer equally strong liberals arts education, but they are different in vibe.<br>Another question to ask him though: does he want to live and work on the East Coast right after graduation? If so, Amherst will have more name recognition there than Carleton for recruiting by employers who are clueless about SLACs. On the other hand, Carleton is better known in the Midwest and among friends in our community, here in California (which is the second biggest supplier of Carls after Minnesota). But in the end, both schools have strong reputations and alumni networks, and both are highly regarded by grad schools, if that is your son\u2019s goal. And among employers who know SLACs, both will have equal standing.<br>Responses to your topics, PART 1:<br><br>\"\"<br>He plans to study Physics (and go on to grad school). The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations. My impression is that Carleton\u2019s Physics program is stronger than Amherst\u2019s.<br>\"\"<br><br>My friends who are physics faculty at top universities (including a college roommate who is a physics professor at Stanford) seem to think Carleton has one of the strongest programs while Amherst is known more for its strength in the humanities & social sciences. This is reflected in the breakdown of students by major too. However, Amherst is an amazing school and I\u2019m sure your son will get a great science education in either school. Incidentally, physics is one of my D\u2019s interests. BTW, did your son get a nice letter from the Carleton physics department chair, Prof. Pattanayak? If he listed Physics as an interest on Common App, he should have.<br><br>\"\"<br>The general campus atmosphere: My son prefers an open, collaborative, diverse, somewhat laid-back environment.<br>\"\"<br><br>Amherst is more diverse ethnically. They have recently made a push to recruit URMs, and the very fact that the college president\u2019s quote on diversity was a topic for the Common App writing supplement speaks volumes about their priorities.<br>Carleton is 60% White. However, Carleton tries hard to make their student body as diverse as possible, given that Minnesota doesn\u2019t attract as many minority students, and they love international students. Moreover, our impression is that the students are very respectful of other cultures, open-minded about diverse ideas and customs, and welcoming of diverse students. (We are Asian American.) Diversity can also refer to interests and personalities, and Carleton is definitely diverse in that sense. My wife and daughter attended the International Festival last Saturday while visiting Carleton and saw evidence of this. Plus, they explicitly asked minority students whether they felt uncomfortable there. Except for one African American male, most said that they never felt excluded or uncomfortable. One African American male from L.A. went so far as to say that he has never worried about being profiled or harassed by cops in the Twin Cities or Northfield, which is a far cry from his lifelong experience in diverse Southern California. (St. Olaf, however, is a different story. Read the news to learn what\u2019s happening there. But right-minded students are standing up against hate and protesting against the administration, which has apparently done nothing to combat the racist acts.)<br>Our takeaway from visits and conversations was that Carleton is one of the friendliest, most supportive, and most collaborative colleges out there. And while the academics are intense, they are pretty laid back, or at least they don\u2019t overtly give off a competitive vibe. Amherst seemed more \u201cclassic New England competitive\u201d to us, and students didn\u2019t appear as happy on the surface, but I don\u2019t want to generalize based on our experience at one point in time. You\u2019ll find all kinds of students at both schools, and I\u2019m sure your son will find a core group of friends who will make his college years a positive experience. Faculty at both schools are great.<br><br>\"\"<br>The kind of students who go there: To give an idea, one thing he really liked about Carleton, in a survey asking students what word they\u2019d use to describe students there, \u201cquirky\u201d was the top choice (at another school, it was \u201chipster\u201d, which he didn\u2019t care for).<br>\"\"<br><br>PSA: Some past and present Carls are requesting that people get over the \u201cquirky\u201d label.  However, it is true that students at Carleton come from colorful backgrounds, which makes life more interesting. I can tell you that we found the students (and other college community members) to be the friendliest and most down-to-earth of the 30+ colleges we visited. EVERYONE would stop and talk at length about everything we wanted to know, and if they were rushing to class, they would offer to drag my daughter along with them to class, introduce her to professors, and treat her to coffee and lunch afterwards. How cool is that? This is precisely why she fell in love with that place.<br>Our tour guide at Amherst was friendly, but aren\u2019t all of them expected to be? The average student we intercepted to chat seemed to be in a hurry to get away, no matter the time of day. Not a reason to judge an entire school, but we couldn\u2019t help coming away with certain perceptions of the campus culture.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@csdad2 - Responses to your topics, PART 2:<br><br>\"\"<br>We often hear about the prominence of athletics at schools like Amherst (and Williams). Just how much is this the case there, and how would it affect someone not active in athletics? (My son played soccer in high school, also some ultimate and tennis, but he is not at a level to play on a college team.)<br>\"\"<br><br>I don\u2019t think this will be a big deal at either school. At most schools, even SLACs, athletes (and the men/women attracted to them) often form cliques. It goes hand in hand with team bonding. However, it usually doesn\u2019t affect other students, unless they are dying to be part of who they perceive to be the \u201cin\u201d crowd and get rejected. And we\u2019re not talking about giant powerhouses of NCAA Division I here.<br><br>\"\"<br>The study abroad program<br>\"\"<br><br>We like Carleton\u2019s specific options, but both schools will offer excellent opportunities. One difference worth noting: the Carleton trimester-based academic calendar enables a student with demanding academic requirements (for a double major, for example) to go abroad for the six-week winter break (Thanksgiving to New Year\u2019s) or for a 10-week trimester. In the latter case, the student can still take classes in Northfield for the other two trimesters, if desired. (Or you can go abroad for half a year to a year.)<br><br>\"\"<br>We\u2019re in Illinois, and one of my son\u2019s preferences is to get out of the midwest. (I\u2019m from the east coast originally, and still have family there.)<br>\"\"<br><br>There you go. Amherst wins, if this is important to your son. For us, it was the opposite. My daughter will be experiencing something very different by going to the Midwest, which is one reason she turned down all of her California choices. I agree with your son that it is important to explore something different.<br><br>\"\"<br>Amherst\u2019s endowment is quite a bit larger \u2013 does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools?<br>\"\"<br><br>Not that I noticed, but there may some advantages. Amherst has a slightly better student:faculty ratio. My impression is that Amherst provides slightly better financial aid, but each person\u2019s experience may be different. On the other hand, Amherst has a higher sticker price, and Carleton spends more on R&D (can\u2019t find my source, but I saw the figures somewhere). So who knows?<br><br>\"\"<br>Financial aid: Amherst\u2019s aid is \u201cno loan\u201d. Does that mean we can\u2019t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to? And if we can, would it be on top of the grant they\u2019ve already given us, or would it displace some of it? (Their website seems to suggest the former; I plan to speak with their FA office tomorrow.) With the loan, the FA packages are very similar.<br>\"\"<br><br>You can always borrow a Parent Plus loan up to the expected family contribution. It will not replace any grants or scholarships. Eligibility for Federal Stafford loans, subsidized or unsubsidized, should be stated on the financial aid offer.<br>Good luck! As others will tell you, your son can\u2019t go wrong with either choice. Great schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Corbett</b><br><br>Number of Physics & Astronomy majors at Carleton, Class of 2016: 26<br>https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/ira/assets/Majors_grads_trends.pdf<br>Number of Physics & Astronomy majors at Amherst, Class of 2016: 7<br>https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/Amherst%2520College%2520SSR%2520Class%2520of%25202020.pdf<br>So there do appear to be significantly more physics majors at Carleton. It would not be surprising if the physics resources at Carleton (faculty, labs, class options, etc) were more extensive, given this disparity.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>Students at Carleton dressed up the Goodsell Observatory as R2D2. Not a reason to choose Carleton, but I think that\u2019s pretty cool.<br><br>", "<b>Username: juillet</b><br><br>^I would not use the raw numbers, or even proportions, of science majors at a school to evaluate the quality of that college\u2019s programs in science. Quality is far more reliant on the professors and the resources offered at the college. One could also argue that open-curriculum schools attract a lot of STEM students who want to avoid taking humanities classes, and indeed, I have heard many STEM students make that claim. So I\u2019d avoid stereotyping and go straight for the facts.<br>Let\u2019s also remember that undergraduate students go to get a well-rounded undergraduate education, not specifically to study one thing like a graduate program. It\u2019s important to go to a college with a solid department in the area of interest (particularly if there is interest in doing research), but either Carleton or Amherst will offer that. You could literally flip a coin and be fine. You don\u2019t have to go to the best tippy-top school in a specific discipline to get into a PhD program in that area. What you need is a good solid department and at least one professor who is willing to mentor and shepherd you through for research and grad school. I\u2019m confident you could get that at either college.<br>A quick look at the departmental websites show that their physics faculty is about the same size - if I counted correctly, excluding visiting and emeriti professors there are 9 full-time, tenure or tenure-track faculty at Carleton and 8 at Amherst. Amherst\u2019s are, on average, more established in their careers (they are more heavily populated with full professors, who have typically been teaching 12-15+ years), but not by a whole lot - Carleton has one or two more assistant professors, it seems. The faculty at both Amherst and Carleton got their PhDs from physics departments of roughly equivalent quality, on average. A few more of Carleton\u2019s faculty went to higher-ranked programs. Both have solid representation in astronomy and astrophysics, from browsing the catalogs. Amherst may benefit from a close connection with UMass, which has a mid-ranked physics doctoral program.<br>I don\u2019t know anything about physical facilities but those can offer a clue to the level of investment (and anticipated enrollments) a college has in particular subject areas.<br>I will say, though, that Carleton is a top 10 producer of PhDs more generally and a top 5 producer of PhDs in the physical sciences. Amherst is in the top 30 for science and engineering PhDs overall. That could be due to a lot of different factors, but interest and investment in the sciences might be contributing factors there too. (Pomona is in the top 15 and Williams is in the top 20. This data is from the Survey of Earned Doctorates conducted by the National Science Foundation.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: 1190</b><br><br>Bobshaw - Goodsell Observatory as R2D2 - a glorious moment in Carleton pranking history!<br>http://www.citypages.com/news/carleton-students-love-r2-d2-so-much-they-turn-a-building-into-the-droid-6539523<br><br>", "<b>Username: bucketDad</b><br><br>I\u2019m an Amherst grad with a Physics PhD.  I went to grad school with a guy from Carleton.  I think either school will prepare you for pursuing a doctorate.  I\u2019d consider the differences in the departments to be a wash.  If you are going to a LAC it\u2019s because to want to study physics and Russian Lit, or philosophy, or whatever the best professors on campus are teaching. Consider broadening your comparison.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@juillet and @bucketDad make a good point: you go to a liberal arts school for a well-rounded education, so simply comparing physics departments is selling yourself short. Besides, who knows what your son will become interested in once he starts college? In this comparison, I think the academics are generally comparable. However, your son may prefer the open curriculum of Amherst to the breadth requirements of Carleton (or vice versa). I would caution you on comparing specific professors. You\u2019ll find great professors at both schools.<br>Then there is the question of three classes per trimester (Carleton) vs. four classes per semester (Amherst). This can make a huge difference, depending on your son\u2019s learning style. As an example, since my firstborn is a champion of procrastination and last-minute cramming, like her father, the trimester system is excellent. She is used to the fast pace given her background in taking classes at the community college (quarter system), and the ten-week schedule will give her no time to slack off. On the other hand, a friend of ours with a chemistry degree from Berkeley looked at the syllabus of the intro chemistry class and said, \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s a lot to absorb in such a short period of time.\u201d The semester system gives you more time to let concepts sink in. What does your son prefer? Is he disciplined about staying on top of his work and pacing himself?<br>Regarding @juillet 's point about facilities, I can tell you firsthand that Carleton\u2019s science facilities are better than Amherst\u2019s, and further improvements are in the works. Then again, someone mentioned that Amherst also has improvement projects planned, so during your son\u2019s time in college, this may become a wash.<br><br>", "<b>Username: momcinco</b><br><br>You are getting some great input here, OP.

The point of distribution requirements is simply to guarantee that a STEM major takes non-STEM classes.<br>So you could have been a STEM major and taken lots of cool non-STEM courses at any of these schools. The only difference is that Amherst allowed you to take cool non-STEM courses on a voluntary basis, while at the other schools, taking cool non-STEM courses would have been required. But the net result (for you) would have been exactly the same.<br>If you plan to explore a wide variety of disciplines during your LAC career, then it makes no difference whether you pick a school with an open curriculum or one with distribution requirements.

Carleton/Minnesota, while still the midwest, does provide some differences from where we are, e.g., in terms of culture/geography/recreation/climate.  Carleton also pulls in a fair proportion of students from other parts of the country (e.g., the coasts).  And before he heard from Amherst, my son did favor it over some other east coast schools.<br>As to what he might do after school, he is interested in doing something research-related, perhaps space-related.  I\u2019m not sure either location provides a significant advantage in this regard, especially since grad school is likely to happen in the interim.  And of course, this all could change during undergrad.<br>He is interested in doing research, both during the school year and during summers.  Perhaps I should\u2019ve mentioned this, although I don\u2019t know how much of a difference this will make, it does seem like both schools present good opportunities for this.<br>He is interested in being exposed to a broad variety of courses and fields, although not necessarily to the point of double-majoring.  He has been open to schools with a core curriculum or a more open curriculum, so I don\u2019t think this is a major factor (especially between two schools like this).<br>He does play the viola quite well and is interested in continuing that, say participating in an orchestra.  But again, not to the level, say, of double-majoring or minoring in Music.  This kind of opportunity seemed present at most of the schools we looked at, so I didn\u2019t feel the need to mention it.<br>We did visit Amherst a few months back, and did hear about and see the construction of the new science building.  But we didn\u2019t see images/plans for the entire facility, so thanks for those links @ThankYouforHelp and @OHMomof2.  It looks like it will be a great addition to campus.<br>Another point I should perhaps mention: He has work-study as part of his FA package.  At Carleton, they find the position for you, whereas at most other schools the student is on their own to find a position.  Anyone know how this works at Amherst?

Subsequent years, he found jobs that were more suited to his interests, though I will say that he loved even working in the dining hall. lol One thing I loved is how kids get paid.
