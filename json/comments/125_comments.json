Have you ever been on the Chicago lakefront in winter?  Yikes!<br>\"\"<br><br>I dont know if I like them as I am a native Californian moved to Texas<br><br>", "<b>Username: mdawgggggggg</b><br><br><br><br><br> Riversider:<br>\"\"<br>Information provided by you:<br>Information needed:<br>What\u2019s your race? What are your PSAT, AP and SAT subject test scores? Do you have good LORs?<br>\"\"<br><br>White, no PSAT recognition, 1490 SAT, 800 US History, 710 Math II. Stats are not great. LOR (US History and Calculus teacher, have had both two years and am very close with them) and Common App essay( nice metaphor, good points) are very good. Writing will have to set me apart.<br><br>", "<b>Username: dreambig55</b><br><br>I can see why Northwestern and Vandy could be appealing (Duke isn\u2019t on the list, so we\u2019ve never visited).  My S20 has visited both and they are both pretty neck and neck on his \u201clist.\u201d  Even though for his major, Northwestern seems to have a little bit better ranking than Vandy, they\u2019re still neck and neck just because of the great feel he got for the Vandy campus and atmosphere.  I\u2019m not sure if this has been mentioned, but Vandy also has ED II.  You could apply at Northwestern EDI if this is something you feel strongly about doing and have your Vandy app in as RD.  You can see what happens and if you don\u2019t get into Northwestern, you can email your Vandy admissions counselor right away and switch it to ED II to have that option before 1/1.  Of course, the weather is quite different between the 2.  I know my son could hack the winters at NU, so that isn\u2019t as big of a concern for him.<br><br>", "<b>Username: dreambig55</b><br><br>But yeah, now seeing up there somewhere that Chicago winters may not be for you\u2026maybe that\u2019s not a great idea.   My son is quite familiar with them, so Northwestern is pretty high on his list.<br><br>"]}
