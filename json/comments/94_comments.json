If you ask me the UW is overrated by far and UMN is underrated. They are both large research based Big Ten schools. Both have large student bodies. Sure the UW has a slight edge on the strength of student that attends, but when you have CSOM and IT at the \"U\" I feel it's a wash.

However, the rest of the campus is spread out and outside from the beauty of the Lakeshore area, it's a fairly ugly. I really enjoyed how UMN feel centered around the East Bank. For an urban school I felt a better sense of campus there. After talking to students from each school, the feel I get from each campus made it easier for me to choose. At Madison there will be parties nearly 7 days of week. Drinking is much more prevalent (outside of State Street there isn't exactly terribly much more to do in Madison). At the \"U\" there is still partying, but not nearly as much. The \"U\" gave me the feel of a much more laid back environment. As far as the comments stated above about Madison having a 24/7 campus atmosphere, when you have such an amazing city environment around you in Minnesota, why would you want to stick around the Union (i.e. Madison).<br><br>I'm sorry if my comments all seemed one sided. Both are great schools and you can't go wrong with choosing either. It all depends on the environment you want. If you want the excitement of the cities and a more \"chill\" atmosphere by all means choose Minnesota. If you want the more drinking/party/stay on campus sort of style, go to Madison. You will get a great education either way, just choose what kind of campus life you want.

Like at most major research universities, Wisconsin professors tend to focus a great deal on their research. This said, it is a sad cliche/myth (on CC that is) that classes are taught by TAs and that professors are unaproachable. Even at major research universities like Cornell and Wisconsin, over 95% of classes are taught by professors. Some of those classes (mostly introductory level classes) may have a discussion group that is lead by a TA, but the actual class is taught by a professor. 100% of those professor-taught classes have office hours where students may go and talk to the professor on a one-on-one basis.<br><br>At any rate, Minnesota is an excellent and sadly underrated university. I don't think it is quite as strong as Wisconsin though. Wisconsin is one of the top 10 public institutions in the nation.

Acceptance rates are virtually identical, s/f ratios are very close. Wisconsin maintains a very slight edge in the qualifications of incoming students but Minnesota is rapidly closing that gap, having become much more selective in recent years; and that probably will continue as Minnesota's new cut-rate OOS tuition rate will attract a lot of new apps from OOS students, and also as the perception gap closes and more kids from both Minnesota and Wisconsin take a closer look at Minnesota as a real competitor to Wisconsin (remember, kids from either state can go to either school for the same in-state price, and historically that's meant a net export of top students from Minnesota to Wisconsin).<br><br>The one place where Wisconsin has a decisive advantage is in graduation rates.

They already pay in-state rates, so they're not affected by the new OOS rate. Cutting OOS tuition should bring in a lot of non-reciprocity OOS applications, allowing the university to be more selective, thus boosting the credentials of its entering class. And to the extent those new OOS applicants are admitted and enrolled they'll be displacing either Minnesotans or students from the reciprocity states, thus bringing in more tuition revenue--$4K per year for each additional enrolled OOS. Of course, the per-student differential would be higher with a higher tuition, but there would be fewer OOS applicants and fewer of the accepted OOS applicants would actually enroll. I assume the university ran the numbers on this and calculated a $4K differential between in-state and OOS was the optimal point to achieve the dual goals of increasing selectivity and raising revenue.<br>\"\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/profile/barrons\">barrons</a> wrote:\"\"<br><br>Yes but I believe for 2008 the ACT average at Minnesota overall was a 27 which is getting awfully close to 28.

Michigan has better faculties and more prestigious programs in almost every field. But for the quality of the undergrad experience, I'd say that as a smaller school with more of an undergrad focus, Northwestern probably has an edge overall. But that's going to vary tremendously. People in the Residential College, the honors program, or other residential-learning communities at Michigan, especially those who end up in smallish majors where the faculty resources and s/f ratios available to them can be extraordinary, may in fact have undergrad opportunities at Michigan that rival or surpass those at Northwestern. Bottom line: don't be suckered by mindless fealty to US News rankings and those CCers who feed off them.<br><br>", "<b>Username: TheDesertFox</b><br><br>First off, UW-Madison is hardly \"just a party school,\" and I'm not sure where exactly got that idea unless you were just making an assumption off of the popular press. There is a lot of hard partying, of course, but hey, aren't UW-Madison's graduation rates still a lot higher than UMNs? For being \"only\" a party school full of drunks who don't care about school, UW-Madison students sure do seem to have themselves together academically. Honestly, it seems like you are just trying to find ways to lower UW-Madison, like so many people at UMN unfortunately do.<br><br>Anyway, both universities are excellent academically. On a resume, it honestly won't make a difference one bit which school you go to. However, underneath it all, the academics, faculty, and just about everything else IS probably quite a bit better at UW-Madison, and UW-Madison has a WAY bigger, super obvious research presence (almost more than academics, really). But like I said, on a resume, it won't make much of a difference, if at all. Rankings, lists, and all that jazz are incredibly overrated and in the end, if you are going to a school like Minnesota or Wisconsin, its the person and how you present yourself that will determine how you end up much more.<br><br>With that said, what you should be asking yourself is this: What kind of experience am I looking for in college? And it is pretty simple:<br><br>If you are looking for a college experience full of everything college has to offer such as a distinct college culture, serious sports, an active and involved student body, and so on, then your search is already over: UW-Madison.<br><br>If you want to keep hanging out with your friends from your suburban Twin Cities high school and go home every weekend, then your search is again already over: UMN.<br><br>It's generally as simple as that.<br><br>The fact is, although lacking in racial minorities, UW-Madison's student body is exponentially more diverse than UMNs. UMN mainly has people from Minnesota and it's reciprocity states, and thus ideologically and life-experiencally they are pretty much all the same. Going to UMN, you don't get your eyes opened to all sorts of new experiences and so on.<br><br>This is definitely not the case with UW-Madison. Not only does the undergraduate program have thousands and thousands of very gifted undergrads from all over the United States, but from all over the world. And it isn't only slightly noticeable; you will see it pretty much everywhere you go. In fact, UW-Madison (I believe) has the second highest Jewish student body of Public Universities in the entire United States. Koreans, Japanese, Australians, Chinese, all sorts of Europeans, Mexicans, Chileans, and so on and so forth, I've met them all. They all come here because Madison has a nationwide \"rep,\" not only as a party college where you can have fun, but a great academic school and a pretty rad city.<br><br>Furthermore, the students at UW-Madison are much, much more active. Student groups are much more successful, there is much more school pride, and there is just that \"presence\" which makes the college experience so special and easy to look back at with an almost overwhelming nostalgia. In that department, UMN is sorely lacking compared to just about every other Big Ten University. Although UMN students will tell you being in a big city \"gives you more to do,\" I think being in the big city hurts UMN more than it helps it. The big city drowns out the college atmosphere and vibes severely. Plus, what do big cities really offer that you can continually experience over a city like Madison, which offers a lot to do in its own right, anyway?<br><br>Also, obviously nothing near UMN can compare to UW-Madison's culinary diversity.

Third, there may be more direct payoffs to the local economy, as university alumni networks and old school friendships spread across international boundaries, expanding two-way opportunities for transboundary trade, investment, and business deals of all kinds. Simply put, the state of Minnesota is almost certainly better off economically due to the relationships that current Minnesota residents have with old school chums in China, and to the receptiveness of the University's rather impressive alumni network in China when Minnesota businesspeople come calling; that kind of goodwill is invaluable, especially in places like China where so much business depends on networks of personal contacts and bonds of trust.

If you are in the big ten, sans MSU maybe, it's the person, not the college.<br><br>So, I honestly think the University of Minnesota, Iowa, and others are already as good of a university as Wisconsin. Good in the sense that, it probably won't make a difference if a bright student goes to one school over the other. Wisconsin seems to have a \"pride\" that I don't see in other big ten colleges so much, though. An alumni-supporting-alumni thing that I can really only compare to USC.<br><br>But anyway, when it comes to \"prestige\" and \"recognition,\" which is mainly what I have been talking about, UW does have significantly more than Minnesota, and even more significantly less than Michigan. I think the CC forums generally show that, as the UW board has 7 times the amount of topics of the Minnesota board (and no, it doesn't mean that 17-year-olds applying to Minnesota are just \"busier\"). People across the US know about Wisconsin. The University here often gets shout outs in movies and television shows, and in fact, MTV was filming a reality show about \"college life\" last fall as well. Maybe that is a bad thing, though.<br><br>Also, interesting thought: How does arguably the most economically depressed, hopeless major state in the country (Michigan) support such a prestigious university?<br><br>", "<b>Username: danmam</b><br><br>I'm stuck with this decision too (pending my almost sure rejection from MIT in mid-March). I live in Wisconsin and will be in engineering. I know Wisconsin's engineering program as a whole is stronger than Minnesota's, plus Madison is only about an hour and a half from me, while Minnesota is a 6 hour drive, so I'd rather choose Madison. However, Minnesota is offering $11,500 a year for 4 years, Madison is only offering $2250 (valedictorian scholarship) plus whatever other scholarships I win (probably no more than $3000, at the most).<br><br>Is it worth it to go to Madison, spend the extra money but get the \"prestige\" boost? Or is there really no reason to turn down UMN's scholarship?<br><br>Thanks for any advice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ewho</b><br><br>You can always come back to Madison for graduate school, if money is an issue for you right now. However, if you can afford it, go to Madison. It is worth it if you pay in-state tuition.<br><br>", "<b>Username: danmam</b><br><br>It's not a matter of affordability. My parents have agreed to pay for half of an in-state education (basically what it costs at Madison for tuition+books+room/board+university meal plan). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Madison is probably going to be about $20K this year (including books, room/board, and meal plan), so my parents will chip in $10K a year (no matter where I go). That means if I go to Minnesota I won't be paying a cent out of my pocket.<br><br>Any other suggestions?<br><br>", "<b>Username: noimagination</b><br><br>> Also, interesting thought: How does arguably the most economically depressed, hopeless major state in the country (Michigan) support such a prestigious university?<br><br>Answer: U Michigan charges out-of-state students a lot. Also, I think (don't know) that Michigan sends most of its education money to Ann Arbor. For what it's worth, only 7% of the school's general fund comes from the state: <a href=\"http://www.vpcomm.umich.edu/budget/understanding.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">U-M Budget Update - University Budget - Understanding the Budget</a><br><br><img src=\"http://www.vpcomm.umich.edu/budget/i/gen_fund_aa_allfunds08.jpg\" alt=\"gen_fund_aa_allfunds08.jpg\"><br><br>", "<b>Username: ewho</b><br><br>I see. Let me put this way, can you picture yourself to live somewhere for $10,000 a year for four years, or you own $40,000 after 4 years for what you have done.

At the same time they are decreasing the size of the freshman class, they just received a record high number of applications (32,000).<br><br>While Wisconsin's applications dipped to 24,200 for a slightly smaller freshman class. Apparently, far less in-state people applied to the school, for a reason no one really knows, while out of state applications went up.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rjkofnovi</b><br><br>So TheDesertFox Michigan isn't so great and MSU is the worst school in the big ten. Interesting.<br><br>", "<b>Username: GoBlue81</b><br><br>\"\"The professors who actually spend little to no time with the undergraduate students?\"\"<br>That's a myth. In ChE, most of the profs teach two courses a year, usually with one at the undergrad level. Once you are in the dept, you have access to all the profs. Another way to work with a professor is through undergrad research, and you can start in your freshman year. How much time you get to meet the profs is entirely up to you.<br><br>"]}
