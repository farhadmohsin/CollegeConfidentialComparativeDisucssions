Now in front of me is hard dilemma what advice to give my son. He did great job and now can select where he will study CS. Main problem with choise and for me and for him is that we never were in USA. We don\u2019t know your life, your values, your priorities, what is really important in USA and what is just \u201cbetter to have\u201d. So very easy he can make mistake with choice due to missing some things absolutely obvious for any American.<br>I understand that Grinnell and U of Arizona  are very different, one is small private college and another is big public university. That\u2019s why it so difficult for me to compare them. I can\u2019t even find rankings where they are together. I know that Grinnell has reputation of top one and reputation of UA is closer to mid-range. Generaly I already know about them many things that can be find in google. But to read in google about something is one thing, to live inside is other thing.<br>After applying grant from Grinnell and scholarship from UA price of Grinnell  will be for me 10000$ per year higher. I can pay those money but that is essencial amount for me. Does it really have sence to pay 40000$ more for study of CS in Grinnell instead of UA? If yes why?<br>U of Zurich is high-ranked and almost free, just symbolic 1000-2000$ per year. Though life in Swiss is absolutely not cheap. One more advantage is that students of UZH can take classes in ETH, one of best technical universities in the world, and ETH is next building at the street.<br>I understand that here very few people can have idea about UZH. As well at any Swiss forum will be very hard to find anybody why know in details about Grinnell and U of Arizona. That making this cross-comparison difficult thing. But I still have hope to get answers. Thank you in advance!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br><br><br>Zurich & ETH<br><br><br>University of Arizona<br><br><br>Grinnell College<br><br><br>Better to leave study in the US for graduate school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>@Publisher: No LAC experience in grad school.<br>I personally think the choice should be between Zurich and Grinnell.<br>If you\u2019re going to choose a big public, choose the better cheaper one with better students (Zurich over U of A).<br>The question then becomes whether the LAC experience (at one of the richest top LACs, though granted, in rural Iowa) is worth it.  He would get more opportunities to work with and do research with faculty at Grinnell and have more resources per capita. Probably have a tighter bond with the student body there as well. At Zurich, there would be more self-study, more self-motivation needed, etc.<br>Also, is the CS curriculum at Zurich more theoretical or project-based (like CS in the US generally is)?<br>I think it matters what his plan is after undergrad is as well. If it is working (or getting a master\u2019s and then working), Zurich may make more sense if he is self-motivated. If it is to get a PhD, he can more easily get good recommendations from profs at Grinnell if he is a good student. There\u2019s a reason why LACs tend to dominate per capita PhD entry rankings (other reason is that they offer few pre-professional majors). And American CS PhD programs  would be fully-funded. If he goes the Zurich route, he\u2019d almost certainly have to get a master\u2019s before attempting to apply to a PhD program.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>@PurpleTitan : I do not understand your message to me in the context of this thread.<br>Also, do not understand your discussion with respect to PhD.<br>My grad school reference\u2013although not stated\u2013had specialty masters programs in mind such as data analysis.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>@Publisher: Grinnell is a LAC.

Because main determinant will be his citizenship, not his grades, GPAs, ect.<br>So jumping between Swiss and USA to appear end of day and not here and not there  not good choice.

I am attaching the class of 2018 post-graduation report, it goes into great detail by major.  Cost of living is very low in Iowa and most activities are free.  There are a lot of study abroad options junior year.  Grinnell is currently sending all students home due to Covid-19 but in a week I would suggest contacting both the Comp Sci department and career services to answer more specific questions.

U of A.<br>If the end goal is to have a path to citizenship,  SWI is definitely out, but the US, in today\u2019s climate, isn\u2019t easy either.

I have had two already and am hoping for a third this summer (but up in the air).<br>If you want more info about the Grinnell CS major, I\u2019ll direct you to a CS professor\u2019s blog where he has written an exhaustive resource on the topic. http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/index-prospective-students.html If you enjoy his writing, explore the rest of the blog for stuff all about Grinnell\u2019s culture and just his random thoughts.

I am a third year student at Grinnell.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Tigerle</b><br><br>You have said that the 12 k tuition at Grinnell (+ room and board) is not a drama for you). I\u2019d choose Grinnell, then.<br>Not for the LAC experience, which, frankly, at this point in history, for a kid from Belarus is a luxury he shouldn\u2019t think about twice. Not because of the parties, the movies, the advising, whatever. He will make his way. He won\u2019t expect anyone to wait for him. He\u2019ll do.<br>He should choose it for the connections, the alumni, the internships, the support he can expect when things go tits up again, as they very well may, off and on, the options his profs and the career center can help him with as far as grad school and jobs and visas are concerned. I do not think (correct me if I\u2019m wrong) will get as much support at the U of A. He\u2019ll definitely not get it at the U of Zurich. (And guys, the U of Zurich is definitely not the ETH. Nope, it\u2019s NOT well known for STEM! That\u2019s why everyone is getting it mixed up!)<br>And Switzerland is not welcoming to immigrants in ways that midwestern LACs are. No one has an incentive to help you stay. Switzerland has a 25 percent immigrant workforce and they want fewer. They are just more polite about it.<br>And Zurich is about the most expensive city to live in in the world. Please check the housing market before making any decision! The only reason it may end up being cheaper may be that it\u2019s 3 years instead of 4.<br>It\u2019s all a roll of the dice. Agree that Belarus right now is not a good backup, and I hesitate to recommend German universities to anyone from the US, but if for some reason the US options don\u2019t work out, Germany is still there and if he can wrangle a residence permit he\u2019ll even get a bursary  - and depending on where he ends up studying I may be the person hitting you up for repayment! <br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>@Tigerle, why wouldn\u2019t you recommend German unis?<br>And yes, Zurich seems extremely expensive.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Tigerle</b><br><br>@PurpleTitan , not for American students because they are so radically different from what they expect, and the main attraction is usually that they\u2019re cheap - not because the kid is actually interested in going to Germany and thrives on adventure and adversity.<br>This is a kid who has been taught resilience. All he needs is a place that won\u2019t kick him out again and he\u2019ll be okay. Problem is, we don\u2019t know whether the US or Switzerland will be that place. But if the US kicks him out, he can try Canada, if Canada kicks him out, I imagine he can still try Germany, because he then has CS + English + German language skills which might help.<br>If Switzerland kicks him out, not sure whether Canada still is an option. Germany still might be.<br>For Switzerland, I\u2019d budget at least 20 000 CHF for the year, that\u2019s  pretty much 20 000 USD, and it will be a hassle. But he\u2019s got an uncle there, you said?

I  don\u2019t want to argue with you. I want to explain why selection Grinnell / UZH is so hard dilemma.<br>I definitely know that UZH is not ETH. But university where 12 Nobel Prize Laureates were graduated definitely can\u2019t be estimated as something secondary. Specially for CS QS placing UZH in 100-150 best U of the world, THE to 83 place in the world. Not very top, but and not so bad. And ability to take classes in ETH also making big difference.<br>I also know that Swiss is expensive. But cost of life is something that partly under your control as opposed to tuition fee. You can rent in suburb instead of main street and nobody can force you to visit restaurant daily. From my studying about Swiss I got that high cost of life is more relate to luxury segment and basic things price (food in supermarket, lunch in student canteen) not so dramatically different from other Europe.<br>About \u201cSwitzerland is not welcoming to immigrants\u201d - the same way as USA frankly saying  Honestly I don\u2019t expect that any country in the world waiting for my son and will be welcome to him. For me his career after graduation is more about right usage of existing abilities rather than waiting for any help and support. USA giving some abilities without any warranties, Swiss giving some abilities without any warranties. Abilities that giving USA as per my opinion now essentially degrading.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alezzz</b><br><br><br><br><br> Tigerle:<br>\"\"<br>But he\u2019s got an uncle there, you said?

There should an affordable health insurance option for students, find out, Try to get a room in a hall of residence., via the university housing office. Apply now. (Just withdraw, if you decide on Grinnell after all, European universities don\u2019t care). Food in Swiss supermarkets is expensive too, that\u2019s why the Swiss drive across the border to German, France and Italian supermarkets if they live close enough. Restaurant prices are outrageous. Maybe you can send cheap care packages with months worth of pasta!<br>But everything is nice and clean and works and runs on time. Germany on steroids.
