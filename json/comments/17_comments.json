Why apply early decision if you're not absolutely sure that you would be able to bear the burden of the costs, if you do not end up getting a merit scholarship, which very few accepted applicants do and about which you would not find out until spring-time anyway? Sure, Duke is alluring, but is it worth all that (uncertain) debt in your eyes? Otherwise, you face a situation where you are at the mercy of the whims of the financial aid office to hopefully make some meaningful change to your financial aid, which, unless there has been some change in your financial situation between before and after your application, is unlikely. You have to know the risks going in. I'm not trying to worry you, I'm just trying to help paint a clearer picture of the situation and of the high risks of certain decisions.<br><br>Also, for the excerpt, \"Should a student who applies for financial aid not be offered an award that makes attendance possible, the student may decline the offer of admission and be released from the Early Decision commitment.\"<br>Do you realize how ambiguous this is, for a contract?

There can be different interpretations of this statement, and you are at the natural disadvantage of already having an offer that you are not satisfied with and having to force some type of change, which is generally not easy.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Leggomyeggo990</b><br><br>Although I am in a similar situation with the financial aid, I think if you really need to you should go to UF.

Personally, I would not want to have to renege (it IS \"renege\" b the way, and not \"renegade\" ;) ). Did you go in thinking you could always get out of it? And hey, there's always the 4k or so a year that they expect you to pay from a summer job and by doing work study! I know it's not much, but it softens the blow to your parents a bit and is not a loan.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sandrose140</b><br><br>Ok I don't think I should have to be defending my decision of applying early decision to Duke, but here goes nothing.<br><br>A year ago if you asked me where I was going to apply to college I would have said Harvard and UF. Then a family friend told me that I could get a ton of MERIT BASED grants and scholarships from second tier schools, so I decided to do my research. Though it seemed unlikely I would get a full ride to Duke I thought I could squeeze by with maybe $20,000 in Work study and grants. Duke is my top choice school and I wanted to have the chance to get these MERIT BASED SCHOLARSHIPS before the regular decision applicants.<br>ONCE AGAIN... I thought when I got my acceptance letter in the mail I would be getting a package containing incentives for me to attend Duke university. SOO I couldn't use the \"net price calculator\" to determine my MERIT BASED financial aid.<br><br>As to the ability to renege (is this right?) on my Early Decision contract, even if my parents were billionaires (which they're not, for the record) Duke can't force me to attend their college if I (EMPHASIS ON I) can't pay for it. I'm sorry that I'm using all caps but this needs to be said. JUST BECAUSE MY PARENTS CAN PAY FOR IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WILL. My parents have 100% control over their own finances and they decided they are unwilling to pay for me to go to Duke. I am extremely grateful for the amount they are willing to contribute, unfortunately I am unable to cover the remaining cost without a little help from Duke.<br><br>Now, with that being said, I want to attend Duke more than any other University on the planet. I have been reduced to tears the past couple days because the fact that I could attend Duke and am financial unable is heart-breaking for me. I am now looking for less appealing options that are financially in reach.<br><br>I started this thread to ask the good people of college confidential if it was worth almost $200,000 dollars in student loans to attend Duke instead of the University of Florida, NOT TO BE SCOLDED BY STRANGERS FOR APPLYING TO DUKE EARLY DECISION.<br><br>", "<b>Username: texaspg</b><br><br>Duke has some merit money but most schools don't hand out serious merit money until after regular decisions.

Apparently times have changed since my family friend attended college, because no such package came in the mail.<br><br>", "<b>Username: texaspg</b><br><br>The problem is that the universities do not feel the need to push a package for you if you dont qualify for FA based on parental income and you applied for a binding decision.

If you're still asking about the age-old question of whether it's worth going into huge debt for an elite school rather than going debt-free to your in-state public school, you have to weight the expected payoffs and experiences, long term, with the risks and costs. Having gone to and graduated from Duke engineering when I myself could have gone even beyond full ride to my in-state public school, I will say that I wouldn't trade my experiences there for anything, period, and it has led to me where I am now. But I also don't have $200,000 in debt...is it worth that in debt? Hmm..probably not, to be perfectly honest. It's such a monumental risk to take, and if you're going to continue in graduate school, you're going to go farther down the rabbit hole. That's not considering future mortgages and other real-life stuff that will require you to go into debt. I'm obviously a huge Duke fan since it's my alma mater but, loyalties aside, I'll be the first to tell you that you better think long and hard about decision, especially when considering programs that Duke might not necessarily be world renowned for. p.s. what kind of school would eliminate their comp sci program?

And you did receive something from financial aid with the decision, just not an amount that is do-able? (just clarifying that FinAid DID send something, not that no package whatsoever arrived?) And I'm guessing this lack of aid was due to the info your parents had to put on the CSS Profile? Duke claims to meet 100% of need, though I guess it all depends on how they perceive/asses that need?
