{"title": "decision ohio state vs university of alabama", "comments": ["<b>Username: d012939</b><br><br>I was accepted by both schools into my major of mechanical engineering, both have accepted me into their honors programs, and I have received my merit scholarship information from both. At UA, I got the Presidential, full tuition scholarship (plus a small engineering scholarship). At OSU, I received the National Buckeye out of state scholarship + Maximus. I live in Illinois, so both are out of state, but UA would cost me around $11k per year and OSU would be like $22k per year.<br>My stats (for reference):<br>34 ACT<br>4.58 GPA<br>Mostly AP/honors<br>My school doesn\u2019t class rank, but the OSU regional recruiter said she thought I\u2019m probably top 1%.<br>Academics: Now, OSU\u2019s engineering program is ranked like 27, but UA is like 105.  That is a big difference, but I realize rankings aren\u2019t everything, and UA was one of the first five colleges to offer engineering, so they have a pretty solid program. I just don\u2019t know if OSU\u2019s more prestigious program is worth the extra money. The hard part is, I know for a fact that I\u2019m the type of student who will do whatever I need to do to be successful no matter where I go,<br>Opportunities: OSU has more of the clubs/extracurriculars that I\u2019m looking for and it has a bigger alumni network. I\u2019m in the honors program at both. I\u2019m waiting to hear back from the Eminence Fellows program at OSU which is unbeatable. Meanwhile, I was rejected from University Fellows at Bama, but I am a finalist for Computer Based Honors Program. To me, CBHP would be awesome if I went to Bama, but it\u2019s not a deciding factor.<br>Location: OSU is an urban campus, which I prefer, and I like Columbus and all the internship opportunities and benefits that come with it.  It\u2019s also a 6 hour drive, whereas UA is a 12 hour drive. I do like the warm Alabama, but it\u2019s definitely a college-town.<br>Ambiance/vibes: I feel my personality and studious-emphasis fits in much better at OSU. I\u2019m don\u2019t drink and I\u2019m not a huge partner, so I don\u2019t plan on joining a frat, but Bama is so Greek-heavy that I feel like I\u2019d be an outlier. Also, not saying that the students at Bama aren\u2019t smart, but it\u2019s just much easier to get in with lower stats, and I feel like being surrounded by others more similar to me is a big benefit of OSU, especially on my social life.<br>I\u2019m still waiting to hear back on the super competitive full tuition and full ride scholarships I applied for at OSU, but if I got either of those, I\u2019m definitely going to be a Buckeye. But, I can\u2019t rely on those whatsoever, so I\u2019m just trying to decide if I should suck it up and save some money by going to Bama (and graduate WITHOUT DEBT\u2013I know, unheard of!) or if it\u2019s worth it to cough up the cash for the better academic and social opportunities at OSU.<br>Any and all input is appreciated, because there may be something I haven\u2019t considered. I know it\u2019s my decision, but it\u2019s really tough (even though I\u2019m leaning towards OSU) and I like hearing others\u2019 opinions. Thanks!<br><br>", "<b>Username: d012939</b><br><br>Oh!

Good luck with your decision<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mom2aphysicsgeek</b><br><br>@d012939 I have a son who is a chemE who graduated from a small public university (ranked regionally, not nationally) as well as a son who is in CBH and majoring in physics and math.  Here is my perspective fwiw.<br>My chemE ds co-oped alongside students from NCSU, GT, and VA Tech.  At graduation he had multiple job offers from different regions of the country.  He chose to work for a top global chemical company.  He works alongside grads form the engineering powerhouses (UM, UT, UF, GT, etc).  His career has not been determined by his school name.  New hires all start at the same level and pay and promotions are based on job performance, not school name.<br>My ds at Bama is a top student.  He graduated from high school having completed 5 of his in-major physics core classes as well diffEQ, linear alg, and multivariable cal.  He would in no way suggest that Bama is \u201cbeneath him.\u201d  He loves it there. CBH has been awesome and he has been participating in research since his freshman yr.  Last yr he applied to 6 extremely competitive summer REUs for the summer between soph and jr yr.  He was accepted by 3.  (In case you aren\u2019t familiar with REUs, that is a great outcome.) At his REU, other students were from MIT, ND, UPenn, Rice, Case, etc.  Obviously, his being from Bama did not keep him from being accepted.  <br>Anyway, we are a family whose kids are strong students but attendance is based on finances.  They attend and run with every opportunity they are offered.  Our current high school sr has been invited to some pretty amazing interview opportunities.  She is every bit as advanced as her brother and yet the schools are all pretty on par with Bama in rank.  Zero qualms. She\u2019ll be every bit as successful as her siblings bc it college outcomes have a lot to do with what the student does while they are there. Be a student who matters,<br>If you go to CBH weekend, look for the tall physics geek\u2026he\u2019ll tell you just how awesome Bama is, not bc he has to but bc he absolutely has experienced it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: d012939</b><br><br>@Mom2aphysicsgeek Thanks for your thorough response!

I am attending the CBHP interview weekend, and I will definitely look for your son to speak with him<br><br>", "<b>Username: LBad96</b><br><br>@AlbionGirl lol. I\u2019m stating facts.

P.S. Go Bucks!<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsmartdancer</b><br><br>I am a graduate of OSU and took the higher level math/ science courses before changing my major.  My husband got his BS and MS at OSU.  Additionally, we did extensive research and visited Alabama since my daughter was NMF and eligible for nearly full-ride.<br>My opinion is you should go with Alabama.  My husband works for fortune 500 company and says no one cares where you went to college; job performance is key for promotions.  Engineering courses are really difficult at OSU.  He told me it was not unusual for the high score on an exam to be a 39%.  It is also difficult due to the high number of foreign TAs (hard to understand with their accent) that teach very large undergraduate courses.  I think you would have a higher GPA at Alabama while still getting a quality education.  Also of note is that engineers salaries tend to plateau and when I researched mid-career salary, there was virtually no difference in earnings associated with university choice. Avoiding college debt would definitely be goo for your long-term success.  I understand that Alabama also has great internship opportunities.  When we lived in Columbus, I don\u2019t think there were that many great opportunities and the school did not put as much effort in helping students find internships as they did at other schools. While researching Alabama, we also learned of a program they have where you can get BS engineering + MBA in only 5 years.<br>\u201cmom2collegekids\u201d is the resident expert on Alabama and I think her boys were engineering majors.  So you might want to research her posts and maybe send her a message if you have additional questions.<br><br>", "<b>Username: d012939</b><br><br>@momofsmartdancer great response! Thanks <br><br>", "<b>Username: Chardo</b><br><br>Is the higher cost of OSU affordable for you?<br><br>", "<b>Username: d012939</b><br><br>@Chardo it\u2019s hard to know what \u201cafforable\u201d is these days. But I\u2019d definitely have some debt. Nothing that I\u2019d be stuck paying off my whole life or anything like that<br><br>", "<b>Username: TooOld4School</b><br><br>Bama is full of high achieving scholarship students. At Bama a lot of ChemE\u2019s go on to medical school, and the $44K+ savings over OSU will pay for almost a year of tuition. The engineering program is very impressive and the facilities are world class. His friends who go to Bama have had a great experience. Bama is very undergrad focused and the Campus is gorgeous. People are a lot friendlier and don\u2019t get so crazy as OSU. Socially, the M/F ratio at Bama is  45/55 while OSU is 52/48. And don\u2019t get me started about the BBQ.<br>The undergrad focus at Bama is both good and bad. The good is that they do an excellent job teaching and most engineering classes are taught by professors. The bad is that there are not as many research opportunities. That may be an issue for your med school applications.<br>My son is currently a ChemE (likely) major at Michigan and we came down to the same choice (MI vs Bama). But Michigan is a lot higher ranked and travel costs are minimal for us. So if you are 100% certain you will go to med school, Alabama is a better choice (they also have an excellent med school)  but if you are less certain, OSU makes more sense. You will need every penny to pay for your medical education.<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsmartdancer</b><br><br>TooOld4school  has some good points- especially the remark about Alabama being focused on undergraduate education.  I think this focus makes it easier for undergrads to do well.<br>Having paid attention to who has top spots at the company where my engineering husband works, it appears absolutely necessary to have a graduate degree. Many of the higher-ups have more than one MS or Phd.  Minimum requirement would be a MBA.<br>So, in my opinion, it is not just about higher cost or more debt- it is about being able to afford to continue your education past the BS level if you want to move up.  It seems going to Alabama would leave you more funds to allow you to pursue post-grad work.  You might want to inquire at OSU about how many undergrads go on to graduate school there and how many of them receive funding for their education.  I think Dow Corning sponsored the research my husband did at OSU for his MS.  He currently does research- but I think he is the only one at his company doing research that only has an MS.<br>My neighbor has BS mechanical and MBA. He has great people skills and is also very intelligent in engineering field. He was promoted to plant manager (oversees about 700 employees) after about 12 years experience.  He makes a lot of $, but works very long hours and has a lot of headaches where personnel type stuff is concerned.<br>However, if you decide on grad school for engineering, I think OSU would be a great choice.  OSU is all about research and treats grad students very well.  They have a very friendly, team-like environment.  Although, again- it can be challenging.  Of the 8 students who had my husband\u2019s adviser for his MS, only 5 were awarded that degree.  I think one dropped out because he did not maintain the required GPA in grad level courses and two were not successful at defending their thesis.  Of course, if you were interested in MBA, Alabama would be a good choice. Or, maybe just do that anywhere while working in your field.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mom2aphysicsgeek</b><br><br>The OP is a finalist for CBH.

We\u2019ll see what I decide!<br><br>", "<b>Username: ClarinetDad16</b><br><br>Did you look at / apply to UCF?  You have all theme parks right there and they have a solid placement record with Disney and the Imagineer program.<br>Sometimes a big merit offer from a school, like Bama, is flattering.  Can be exciting.  Outcomes are important as you are investing 4 years of your time.  Launching into specific programs / industries can be enhanced at schools with strong relationships into those employers / programs.<br>Do your homework and you will make the right decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JustGraduate</b><br><br>IF the OSU theme parks club really does help get students internships/jobs in the industry, I think it could definitely be worth some premium for attending OSU.  Wish I had a buck for every student I\u2019ve heard say they wanted to work on theme park rides - would have paid for a good chunk of my son\u2019s education lol!  It\u2019s a very difficult field to enter, and if that\u2019s what you really want I would think this could be a big help in getting there - or finding out it\u2019s not something you want to do after all.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ClarinetDad16</b><br><br>Here is the club at UCF, would seem it helps there.  So if OSU has connections too\u2026 https://ucf.collegiatelink.net/organization/TEAatUCF/calendar/details/934197<br><br>", "<b>Username: sevmom</b><br><br>Ah, Cedar Point!  Met my husband there when when we were working there summers during college. We just drove through Columbus last summer and thought the city and campus were very nice. This is a tough one because of the money aspect. Good luck with your decision!<br><br>", "<b>Username: STEM2017</b><br><br>You should also run a calculator on the opportunity cost of foregoing a $300-500 monthly contribution (even higher pre-tax) to a 401k or an IRA for 10 years. I don\u2019t have a calculator in front of me (if someone would be so kind as to run the numbers) but I\u2019m certain that the end result will be astonishing.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sevmom</b><br><br>$22,000 a year seems pretty reasonable to attend a preferred OOS public school, at or even less cost that what many instate publics cost these days. And your parents are willing to help (#33), so that is positive.  If you work some during school and get good internships during the summer that can help.<br><br>", "<b>Username: d012939</b><br><br>@ClarinetDad16 I\u2019m looking at their scholarships but it doesnt say the deadlines, requirements, or award amounts \u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: 2sunny</b><br><br>@d012939  just sent you PM<br><br>"]}
