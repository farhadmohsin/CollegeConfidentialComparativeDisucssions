Those are not easy to get.  I think you will do well at either one.  it really comes down to preference for the school.  Which ever one you feel most comfortable at should be the one you pick.<br>best of luck.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mjrube94</b><br><br>Also look at what GPA is required to maintain the scholarship.  Assuming the programs are the same, I\u2019d vote for the lesser scholarship, so if you have a GPA issue and it is rescinded, the gap will be easier to make up.<br><br>", "<b>Username: greenstudent</b><br><br>It\u2019s very encouraging to hear of an international applicant receiving places and financial aid, well done!

As an international student, I have never visited USA and have no idea about how things are at the other side of the globe.<br><br>", "<b>Username: am9799</b><br><br>Umass Amherst 2 hours ride from Boston. More rural but near a small town and near other colleges. Cold in the winter.<br>UMN TC in down town Minneapolis maybe 20 min ride from the airport . Urban but more mellow, not like NYC or down town Chicago. Very cold in the winter.<br>Both are big Universities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>UMass is in a really cool college town - lots of things for students to do because the town is geared toward the students there. It\u2019s part of the 5 college consortium so there are lots of college students (also, you get to take classes at other colleges if you wish).<br>UMN is in a regional metropolis. It means lots of Fortune 500 headquarters, bars, concerts, etc, plus public transportation, but the city is not geared toward the students.<br>Both places are very nice and very cold! <br><br>", "<b>Username: Kathan99</b><br><br>Which would be better considering internship opportunities given my major is computer science?<br><br>", "<b>Username: garvey</b><br><br>UMASS Amherst would be a great place to pursue computer science.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>Both are good.<br>UMass Is known for its CS program nation-wide. Ask about international students\u2019 internship (support, past numbers, etc).<br>UMN Twin Cities is right in the cities. Note: are you in CS CLA or CS CSE?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kathan99</b><br><br>CS CSE @MYOS1634<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kathan99</b><br><br>@garvey can you tell me why UMass would be better than UMN ?<br><br>", "<b>Username: garvey</b><br><br>If CS is your focus, and internship opportunities are of particular interest to you, then I\u2019d see Massachusetts and proximity to the Boston area, where there is a major emphasis on our tech sector, as a real draw.  UMASS is a diverse, dynamic, vibrant campus and community.  I\u2019m sure UMN has a lot to offer, as well - taking the long view of where you might find the most substantive opportunities to pursue your field, however, I\u2019d say that Amherst, and the Northeast, in general, offers the better fit for what you\u2019ve described of your interests.<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>If you can get your hands on any college guide books such as Fiske (my favorite), Princeton Review, Insiders Guide they may be able to help you get more of a sense for the two schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>CSE is impressive.<br>UMass is well-known for CS.<br>UMN has the Twin Cities.<br>Try to read as much as you can about each.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Snowball_City</b><br><br>UMASS is at least a 2.5 hour drive from Boston.<br>UMN TC has light rail connections to Minneapolis and St Paul.  Plenty of companies available for interning if your visa allows.<br><br>", "<b>Username: garvey</b><br><br>@\u201cSnowball City\u201d - No, UMASS is just 2 hours from Boston. I graduated from there myself, and did the drive to and from Boston all the time, as that was where I was from. The reason I highlighted UMASS\u2019 proximity to Boston is because recruiters associated with Boston/Cambridge area tech firms will be a presence on the UMASS campus.<br>The Twin Cities area, no doubt, has a lot going for it. Still, I\u2019d think that an international student, in particular, would find social and professional opportunities in the Northeast/New York area that are above and beyond what is available in the Midwest of the US.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Snowball_City</b><br><br>Perhaps you drive more quickly than I do.<br>My husband is in high tech.  There are plenty of opportunities here too and a vibrant international community. Minneapolis is a great city to be a student in.<br>edited to add:  data on where CSE grads are employed (by major) https://cse.umn.edu/r/companies-that-hire-cse-graduates/<br><br>", "<b>Username: Phoenix16</b><br><br>@Kathan99 I just stumbled upon your post as it was a very recent one and just wanted to give you my two cents.  I am from India as well (been here in the U.S my entire life though), and live in the Twin Cities.  I will likely be attending UMN for engineering this fall.  Like many have said, you can\u2019t go wrong with either one.  I can say from what I\u2019ve seen, there are plenty of internship and career opportunities in the Twin Cities with large fortune 500 companies hiring many every year.  One of the biggest advantages I see is the fact that the UMN is in the heart of the city and offers a wide range of opportunities.  As for Amherst, its is further away from the city but will still provide numerous opportunities for computer science majors, either way you can\u2019t go wrong with either.<br>Also if I may ask are you applying as an undergrad or grad?<br>If you have any additional questions, please feel free to ask me!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kathan99</b><br><br>undergrad @Phoenix16 . wbu grad or undergrad?<br><br>", "<b>Username: citymama9</b><br><br>If internships during the school year are important to you than go to MN since you\u2019ll be right in the city. Amherst is approx 2.5 hrs from Boston, so it\u2019s not possibe to do internships during the school year, but I guess you can go to Boston in the summers for that. If you want to be in a peaceful, small town than go to UMass. India is pretty hot, right? Be prepared for serious cold weather in MA, but unbelievably crazy cold in MN.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Snowball_City</b><br><br>Don\u2019t let the cold at either place scare you off.  The first winter will be challenging as you learn how to dress in layers and learn that yes you do need that really good pair of gloves and wool socks.  There are thrift stores where you can pick up good used sweaters for a fraction of their original cost.  I have even purchased cashmere sweaters at thrift stores.<br>I am sure that the older international students at either place will share tips with you for getting outfitted for winter, how to find textbooks inexpensively, and where to go for authentic home cooking.  You\u2019ll be fine and really have two good choices.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Phoenix16</b><br><br>@Kathan99 Undergrad here as well!  Biggest advantage I see is that UMN is in the middle of the city, it will be a bit busier and lively as a result compared to Amherst since Boston is further away.  Also the cold shouldn\u2019t be a factor, both places get very cold, but that\u2019s something you\u2019ll get used to after a while.  Either way, whichever you pick will be a great option, there\u2019s advantages and disadvantages to both!<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>Amherst, being a college town,  is extremely lively.  <br><br>", "<b>Username: Kathan99</b><br><br>@Phoenix16  have you committed to UMN?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Phoenix16</b><br><br>@Kathan99 Not yet, but most likely will within the next month.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bouders</b><br><br>@Kathan99 I\u2019ve lived in both areas. For internships in Boston, you\u2019d be competing with students from Harvard, MIT, Northeastern, Tufts, BC, BU, Brandeis etc, all of which have a better name in Boston than UMass. For the Twin Cities, UMN is top of the heap. I\u2019d go to the Twin Cities. The cost of living is much lower there too.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PengsPhils</b><br><br>@bouders<br>Of the schools you listed, only Harvard and MIT will have a better name for CS internships in Boston. Many of the rest are on equal footing. Again, their CS reputation is very strong.<br>Both schools are good though - as others have said, I would choose based on fit. I think overall though, UMass does have the academic and professional edge.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kathan99</b><br><br>I am still confused where to go\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: me29034</b><br><br>There is no right answer. You just need to decide which is best for you based on how people gave described the schools. Both schools are very good.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Phoenix16</b><br><br>You can\u2019t go wrong with either.  It really comes down to personal preference I\u2019d say.<br>If possible, I\u2019d suggest visiting both and seeing which you prefer.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Snowball_City</b><br><br>Have you looked on airfare websites to see how much it would cost to get to the campuses?  I don\u2019t know where you are coming from. If the airfare is different by a couple hundred dollars, would that be a consideration? Include costs from the airport via shuttle bus or light rail.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>Any further acceptances? Any further deliberations?<br>@kathan99<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kathan99</b><br><br>I have finalized on UMN.

You can\u2019t got wrong there.<br>Best of luck to you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>Congratulations!<br>There was no wrong choice so making a decision was all you needed <br>Please let us know how you like it after a couple weeks there  !<br><br>", "<b>Username: singermom4</b><br><br>My son loves being at UMN - double major in CS and Economics.  Minneapolis is a wonderful city to live in too.<br><br>", "<b>Username: am9799</b><br><br>I have friends in both campuses and I also think you can not go wrong. One small difference I see is that UMN has a bit more \u201cspirit\u201d being a big Ten and all that.<br><br>"]}
