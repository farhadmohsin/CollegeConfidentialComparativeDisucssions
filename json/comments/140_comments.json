{"title": "yale vs clemson", "comments": ["<b>Username: SCMomofTwo</b><br><br>My son got into Yale and into The Calhoun Honors College at Clemson. Yale was his first choice. He would love to go to grad school, but would graduate with nearly 60k in debt after the help we can give him and the aid package Yale offered. We could nearly pay for Clemson and he would graduate debt free. He wants to go for Computer Science or Computer Engineering. What would you do?  Would graduating with that much debt mean not going to grad school? He has to make his decision this week. Any insight is appreciated!<br><br>", "<b>Username: STF4717</b><br><br>I once had a client who got into both Yale and University of Maryland for Computer Science.  He very reluctantly chose UMD for the exact reason you state- Yale would\u2019ve put him into debt.<br>There is a lot to be said for being a bigger fish in an honors college pond.  Client graduated from UMD with many job offers, and accepted one at Google.  Was able to start life without debt.  Needless to say, he is now doing quite well.<br>Good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: AlwaysMoving</b><br><br>CS jobs pay enough to pay off $60k in debt.  I would let him pick which program he likes better, but I\u2019d fully explain the monthly budget he will have after college with $60k in debt.<br><br>", "<b>Username: katkatmouse</b><br><br>What exactly tips the scale to Yale? If it\u2019s just the window decal, that\u2019s a really expensive decal.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Yale CS is not their best department. Imho. But it\u2019s an impressive name.<br>He cannot borrow on his own to the 60k level.  It will be than that in the end, because of the 5 percent type increases. And on campus funds are needed too.<br>You will have to co-sign.<br>And I am sure he will pay it all back but if not, you will have to pay or have your personal credit ruined.<br>But CS is a great career out of the gates.<br>And if he wants to live if south Atlantic Clemson has a great network and reputation too. Probably better received by some there than Yale.<br>But for any where else in the world, the Yale name will be an impressive first impression.<br>But in cs it\u2019s about what you know and your chops.<br>So for most -especially on this forum- would never say choose anything but Yale.<br>But in this major, with the financial burden and perhaps the collegiate experience one person is looking for versus a another, Clemson could be a great alternative.<br>I don\u2019t know enough about the Clemson cs program.  But at Yale you know it will have a least a base line of excellence in all fields.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tk21769</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>Would graduating with that much debt mean not going to grad school?<br>\"\"<br><br>Keep in mind that a good doctoral program (if that\u2019s what you have in mind) typically is fully funded.  Basically, you get free tuition and a stipend, plus the option to defer your student loan repayments for as long as you\u2019re in grad school.<br>https://studentloanhero.com/featured/defer-student-loans-grad-school/<br>(That\u2019s just one point to consider. I\u2019m not saying a Yale CE/CS degree is - or isn\u2019t - worth the extra cost.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>There will be recruiting opportunities at Yale there won\u2019t be at Clemson. Same thing for VC funds and networking.<br>Email Yale, presenting your detailed expenses (especially if there were medical expenses) and explaining why the annual expenses are 4-5k above what you can afford. That\u2019d reduce the loans to 40-44k which a Yale CS major should be able to pay back (CS majors can get internships as early as Sophomore year and some even after freshman year, making in a most what most pay over a summer).<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Do you have a good justification to ask for professional judgment, or do you just want Yale to give you more $? They will not consider Clemson a peer school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>I didn\u2019t know the op asked about ib and VC recruiting. They want to be a cs or c engineer.<br>The recruiting or employment opportunities. in your fields op will be fine from either.<br>Yale of course is a universally excepted super school. But no one here is paying your bills. And Clemson is no consolation prize.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>I do not view this situation as a money issue since a Yale degree is almost certainly worth $60,000 of student loan debt when entering an in high demand, high pay career area.<br>In my view, the student should select the school with the better CS or CE major & department.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>It is if you don\u2019t want to co-sign a<br>Loan or  need to refinance etc. as a parent and have a tight dti. Your statement is accurate but too broad.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SCMomofTwo</b><br><br>Why Yale? He visited and emailed a professor before going who invited him to tour his lab. His experience with the generous nature of this world-class professor who is at the fore in his field and in area where My son wants to study\u2026 bowled him over. He loves the amazing library with original manuscripts\u2026 the liberal arts curriculum with Nobel laureates\u2026 Microsoft and Google opportunities\u2026 proximity to NYC\u2026 loved the campus/ architecture\u2026 residence college atmosphere\u2026 challenging peers\u2026  ON THE FLIP SIDE - Clemson is a great school, he likes the campus, good at CS, less debt, has a lot of friends going there, the Creative Inquiry Research Program, and his credits would transfer.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Ah, well this new info is helpful.

But at least you\u2019re being open to the other options.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 1stTimeThruMom</b><br><br>Computer science is in so much demand, he should be able to get a job that will pay for the cost of his MS and then get a fellowship or sponsorship for a PhD. The connections he would make at Yale will be irreplaceable.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Students are allowed to take on loan in their name outside all of your school loan programs, merit aid and fin aid. It\u2019s a federal program and it has limits per year. 5500 as a first year.  6500 as sophomore. And 7500 the last two years.  You have to start paying once you graduate or quit school. There are deferment  available for other things too.<br>Any loans they need to fill a gap for any remaining costs - have to be co-singed by the parent.<br>And some parent plus loans and some from your local bank etc all will require you to obtain all on your own.<br>Basically, all of these are  yours to pay back if they can\u2019t.  It does show up on your credit report etc.<br>These all have higher rates than the federal programs.<br>Some require payment to start while the student is still in school.<br>I only mention this as many kids think they can borrow the extra on their own and have a big problem when the first check is due in July for half the year.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 1stTimeThruMom</b><br><br>@SCMomofTwo Clemson and Yale are completely different worlds. There is really no comparison.  Have you been to both? It seems from what you\u2019ve posted that your son would be exposed to many new opportunities at Yale, much more than Clemson can offer.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SCMomofTwo</b><br><br>@privatebanker So helpful! Thank you!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: SCMomofTwo</b><br><br>@1stTimeThruMom so different. He grew up going to the Clemson Campus as it is 30 minutes from home. (Unfortunately, he is not swayed by this fact. Lol! Being away from home doesn\u2019t bother him a bit. He has lived at a residential high school nearly 3 hours from home his junior and senior year, so he rather independent.) He has visited Yale and it was always his top choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: coolweather</b><br><br>I think you are the decision maker here, not him. He already decided.<br>If I were you I would urge him to go to Yale.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@coolweather. Can you lend the OP 60,000.  May not seem like a big deal to you but you don\u2019t know their personal situation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: coolweather</b><br><br>@privatebanker I answered the OP\u2019s question: \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d<br>I understand the OP is at the borderline of the financial decision. When the OP let her son apply to Yale she probably thought hard about this. Yale already provided a big amount of financial aid.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>I\u2019ve told the OP upthread. Yale if you can make it work financially is superb.<br>but Clemson honors  college for the intended major - can be remarkably great too.<br>If it will endanger the family finances, no way.<br>I wouldn\u2019t \u201curge\u201d him to go to Yale, is all I am saying.<br>I would make it happen if possible.<br>But it won\u2019t matter in cs ,if he\u2019s a great computer scientist coming out of either school. It\u2019s an industry where how you code etc if more important than the school name.<br>And Clemson has a wonderful network and can be a really great four years. It\u2019s a great place too.<br>So my answer is a little more nuanced and less absolute.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Boola Boola, Eli Yale! Not my money, but that\u2019s my vote.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jzducol</b><br><br>As a cliche on CC goes, \u201cany PhD program that is worth going and spending five years of your most productive years on should be completely free\u201d.<br>If OP\u2019s son enjoys Yale $60k difference is a small amount considering his future earning potential.  Many kids at Yale make $20k a summer as interns.  And better yet, if he declares advance standing at Yale he can graduate in three years, saving another $15k.<br>If he chooses Yale and later finds that the extra $15k a year is not worth it and he rather join some friends at Clemson, he can always transfer back to Clemson.  But trying to do it the other around, it will be almost impossible.<br><br>", "<b>Username: coolweather</b><br><br>Another possibility for paying the unmet need is working on campus part time jobs and summer jobs. I think it\u2019s easier to have part time jobs and higher hourly rate at Yale because Yale has more money. Yale connection may help finding big summer internship jobs. That how my son get money when he was at MIT. He got more than 6K on on-campus jobs and more than 12K on summer internship each year.<br><br>", "<b>Username: coolweather</b><br><br>@jzducol You beat me in typing.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sue22</b><br><br>Something to consider-Clemson has a 60% 4-year graduation rate. Yale\u2019s is 88%. (source=each school\u2019s 2018-19 Common Data Set). It might not end up applying to your child but it could be a factor.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Unless he got the Clemson National Scholars Scholarship,  I\u2019d really be hard pressed to select it over Yale.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BunnyBlue</b><br><br>I agree with @jzducol that the difference in price is manageable. My sons in CS at a regular non-ivy universities got summer internships starting after sophomore year (the usual time for a first internship) that paid between 17-20k for 12 weeks. Housing was either provided free or there was an additional stipend for it. Plane fare was also covered.<br>Btw campus recruiting was not an issue because the CS internships were listed online and interviews were done online as well.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SCMomofTwo</b><br><br>Wow @BunnyBlue ! That\u2019s great to know!<br><br>", "<b>Username: coolguy40</b><br><br>As a tech professional myself, if he\u2019s going into computers, then it wouldn\u2019t matter where he goes because tech jobs are in very high demand. The 60k would just be a big unnecessary liability that would limit his choices. There\u2019s no benefit. Upon graduation, he\u2019s going to get a market-rate salary based on his experience level, no more no less. The higher companies pay, the easier it is to attract an experienced professional. There\u2019s no benefit for a company to pay more money for a Yale graduate, when they can hire someone who can already do the job.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CU123</b><br><br>As a Yale grad there will be much more opportunity outside of CS then at Clemson, if he decides to go that way (e.g. IB firms are always looking for CS grads to hire and Yale is where they would look first).  At Clemson you would end up in the grinder as @coolguy40 alludes to.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Agree with @CU123.  Summer internship opportunities that may lead to job offers later and at the very least will  provide good experience and will look good on a resume (and probably pay very well) may be easier to get from Yale than from Clemson.  My 2 engineer sons went to good schools, but the one at the top 20 school had fabulous and well paying summer internship fairly easily acquired through the school, whereas younger son, who went to a top 50 school, had to use connections to get his internships, which were not anywhere near as well paying. Both schools offered career fairs that were helpful as they graduated, but the  availability of those high paying internships at well known companies was definitely a benefit at the top 20 school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: coolguy40</b><br><br>Actually, tech companies don\u2019t look at Yale first. They generally look locally and regionally, because there\u2019s less cost and risk recruiting for an entry level job that generally has a higher than average turnover. That\u2019s true even with companies in Silicon Valley. It would be impractical and expensive, even for a major company, to constantly fly Yale graduates down to interview for entry level jobs.<br>I\u2019m going to do a little mythbusting. The reason prestigious schools have higher than average salaries for computer jobs is because they\u2019re on the east/west coast with a higher than average cost of living. A 100k starting salary in San Francisco is about the same as a 55k starting salary in Raleigh, NC. Either way you look at it, you\u2019re getting an entry level job.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Many of the entry level job offers follow a successful summer internship. And many job interviews  (at least the first several rounds) are done remotely, via facetime, etc.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SCMomofTwo</b><br><br>I may surprise a few here with our result. After much deliberation, pros/cons, revisits, discussions with current and past students of both institutions, and soul searching our ds decided on Clemson. He is at peace, and so happy with his decision! It was nearer to his support network, offered great opportunity, and provided an avenue to grad school that made sense to him. He will attend the Honors College! Thank you for all the input. We benefitted greatly from this discussion and debate.<br><br>", "<b>Username: maybearobot</b><br><br>I think he made a great choice.  All of the Clemson Calhoun grads I have known have been extremely successful, including med school and Ivy-league grad schools.  Not incurring the extra debt will also give him more options when he graduates.<br><br>"]}
