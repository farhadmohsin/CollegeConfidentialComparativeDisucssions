No professor in his or her right mind is going to give an A to everyone in the class, Additionally, some universities have formal or informal policies capping the number of A grades given. (D2's uni capped As at no more than 15% for the common freshman &amp; sophomore pre-reqs, for example.) How hard it is for you to get one of those coveted As is going to depend on the quality (not quantity) of the competition.<br><br>Do your high school stats (GPA, ACT/SAT) place you in the top 25% of the entering students at the universities in question? If not, you're going to have a harder time making the cut for As given the competition will be made up of students with stronger academic records and preparation than you.<br><br>For LORs, if the school uses a committee letter, then the committee will write a LOR providing the student meets the qualifications &amp; deadlines the health profession advising office sets out. (Now whether the letter is strongly positive is a different story....)<br><br>For universities that don't use committee letters, the individual has to solicit their own LORs from professors they have had for a class. Most professors will only write a LOR for students who they know well and who have done well in their course. It's singularly unlikely that it will be difficult/impossible to get LORs, assuming the student has made an effort to be involved in class and has met with instructors outside of class (office hours/recitations, etc). Writing LORs is part of professor's job.<br><br>", "<b>Username: twnz19</b><br><br>Any information on SLU pls<br><br>", "<b>Username: thumper1</b><br><br>@twnz19 you can take the required courses to apply to medical school at ANY college.

Classes may be curved<br><br>", "<b>Username: BunnyBlue</b><br><br>Yes. That is true. Going to a school in which the kids have higher stats means it is harder to get a high GPA. This is because, just as you said, so many colleges base their grading on a curve. So going to a college with brighter students makes it harder to get top grades, unless you are tippy-top bright and are still above the bell curve in ability compared to your classmates. We have seen that with our two sons, who are both in computer science and had almost identical high school grades and test scores. The one who went to the school in which students have a higher average SAT score is getting lower grades than the one who went to the college that was one step down in academic level. The one who is getting lower grades is still ok because you only need around a 3.0 average to be considered for jobs in engineering fields. I think for medical school you need to be at least in the 3.6 to 3.8 range (just guessing here, not sure.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: texaspg</b><br><br>I think Emory is a better choice for premed in terms of competition for grades. -This is all relative in terms of who might be matriculating to each school.<br><br>If you are a Washington native, not sure it truly provides better option than UW for instate residency.

In addition, these numbers only count those who applied to medical school for the first time, which would be after junior year at the earliest.

There's no definition of pre-med, and no school publishes the number of freshmen pre-med students, and then the number of those students who are still at that school and ultimately apply.<br><br>"]}
