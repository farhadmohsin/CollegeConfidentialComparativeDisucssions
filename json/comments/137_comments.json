{"title": "urgent help on umich vs uva for social sciences", "comments": ["<b>Username: qwertyz</b><br><br>Hi all,<br>I\u2019ve been slaving myself for the last couple days trying to decide between Mich and UVA, and quite frankly, I still don\u2019t know what to think. Some days, UVA appears better; other days, UM. I\u2019m planning on studying the social sciences, so political science, history, economics, philosophy, etc. with preferably a view toward law school or a year or two in industry.<br>Financial aid is relatively equal, though UM was more generous for my first year package as an OOS and low-income kid. I would have to take a total loan of 22K over four years vs. a total loan of 36K at UVA; work study is 3k per year for UM and 4k per year at UVA. UVA has a weird thing with my preliminary financial aid package where my current aid is about 10k short of the total cost for attendance (though I hope my official aid package corrects this), so if I do commit, there is a chance I could get screwed with an extra 10k in debt.<br>I get better AP credit at UM, whereas UVA doesn\u2019t accept credit for some of my AP tests. UVA has more academic flexibility between schools though, especially accelerated MPP, McIntire second-year transfer, etc. UM Ross and Ford are exclusive for majors and won\u2019t really allow me to double major, etc.<br>Campuses are beautiful in their own right, though I prefer UVA\u2019s mountainous/rural feel. Honestly, if UM switched campuses with UVA, I would probably choose UM in a heartbeat lol. School size distinctions are irrelevant since both are big state schools. I\u2019m not too worried about the cold, growing up in the NE. I would probably like to work in the Midwest/NYC, but placement in both locations at both universities are basically indistinguishable.<br>USNews ranks UVA for undergrad slightly above UM nationally and among public universities, so I might be able to get better undergrad education at UVA. On the other hand, UM has a huge lead in departmental rankings for social sciences; UVA leads in English but only by a margin. The feeling of history and tradition at UVA is nice for what I want to study (humanities/social sciences); plus they have a bunch of old looking statues.<br>Career placement is relatively equal. Both schools I need to work hard to land internships/secure a job. But career placement is the most important factor for me; I really don\u2019t want to be working at a Starbucks after graduation haha. The huge alumni network at UM is a plus, but size doesn\u2019t necessarily prove quality. In industry, I\u2019m probably looking to work for a private consulting firm, so this may be another factor.<br>Some differences I\u2019ve noticed between these two schools:<br>UM:<br>Huge powerhouse research institution, with basically the second most research funding in the nation (National Science Foundation); I would like to do research with profs, so this is a definite plus. UM is actually slightly more selective than UVA; if admissions selectivity trends are to be believed, UM will likely have less than 20% acceptance or just about 20% acceptance this year. School pride is amazing. For me, Greek life is not as prominent and dies off by second year. Worried about being placed on North Campus, but I\u2019ll be in RC or MCSP if I enroll so I should be okay.<br>UVA:<br>More of a focus on undergrad, I feel. The social scene is off-putting with the dominating drinking culture. Some students seem to not like it here very much and don\u2019t fit in as well (in contrast, I\u2019ve really heard nothing but rave reviews about UM). Some students don\u2019t have a good first year, which is a serious bummer. Clubs are exclusive, so I might not even be able to do what I like first year or I might have to settle. This seems like less of a problem at UM due to its size.<br>Honestly, what\u2019s holding me back from choosing UM is that UVA seems slightly more prestigious for undergrad due to its higher public and national rankings. UVA also seems to have more of a focus on undergrad education. UVA campus atmosphere has a greater emphasis on history, and it is nestled away in the mountains. If I choose UM, I feel as though it is perceived as less of an academic powerhouse and more of a sports/party state school in the eyes of the public. Idk, maybe I\u2019m just nitpicking, but they\u2019re so close for me that it becomes kinda meaningless.<br>I want to get a high-paying job out of undergrad, and it is what I care about most right now. I would like to have the best recruiting/career opportunities available to me after graduation.<br>Your thoughts?<br><br>", "<b>Username: sushiritto</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>Honestly, what\u2019s holding me back from choosing UM is that UVA seems slightly more prestigious for undergrad due to its higher public and national rankings.<br>\"\"<br><br>Just look at a different ranking like the Times/THE ranking where UMich is 28 and UVa is 51. Seriously, don\u2019t base your decision on ranking, especially since both schools are peers. Base your decision on fit, both academically and environmentally. Charlottesville and Ann Arbor are very different environments. They\u2019re both prestigious schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: J123D123</b><br><br>Very good synopsis of the two schools.<br>D18 would have had to look at all that you describe more closely had UofM met her need as much as did UVA.  They didn\u2019t so her comparatives were limited to her other Top Choice Schools.  Not relevant here.<br>That said D18 was specifically comparing the PPE program offering at UofM and the PPL program at UVA.  Both have to be applied into at some point and are equally competitive to get into at each institution.<br>The PPE program at UofM is superior ( course offerings ) for someone who weighs the Economics interests more heavily whereas the PPL ( course offerings ) at UVA is far superior to most all other schools as the offering has a ton of courses that appeal to the student with Law School as an Interest.<br>D18 might pursue an Economics minor at UVA to add to the PPL major another best option.  UofM doesn\u2019t offer PPL nor a minor that would cover the \u201cL\u201d.<br>A key point is UVA is very flexible after the fact allowing one to choose majors and take courses across majors.  D18 found this a deciding feature.<br>UVA is a tad closer to the real world for us.  A bit warmer with a real Spring and Fall and shorter winter.  One can say they don\u2019t care but it matters to many more than they realize over time.<br>D18 clearly wanted to avoid the whole drama of Excessive Greek Life.  She thinks things through readily and UVA is far from over the top with this like many of the real Southern Schools.  Not a worry.<br>For us cost help decide quickly.  Difference in meeting need based aid by $15,000 per year.  However if they were priced the same UVA was still the better fit because of the Program of interest.<br>Truly if you flipped Programs and Cost UofM would be the likely winner.<br>If you equalized programs and cost UVA would be the winner for D18.<br>Location Location Location\u2026<br>To be Honest UVA is practically taylor-maid to D18 with the PPL major so trying to avoid any bias here.<br>PS:  You can\u2019t go wrong with either choice if costs and program offerings are nearly equil.  For us it would be about $45,000 more over 4 years to attend UofM for less program wise.  D18 would have been very happy to attend a UofM I\u2019m certain all things mentioned being equil.<br>PSS:  The Location at UVA is the icing on the cake that makes it a much easier option to consider over UofM.<br>Longer Fall, Shorter Winter, Longer Spring<br><br>", "<b>Username: sushiritto</b><br><br>Changing majors and adding minors within UMich LSA is very easy. The plan for my kid is a major and two minors.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rjkofnovi</b><br><br>\u201cIf I choose UM, I feel as though it is perceived as less of an academic powerhouse and more of a sports/party state school in the eyes of the public. Idk, maybe I\u2019m just nitpicking, but they\u2019re so close for me that it becomes kinda meaningless.\u201d<br>You are nitpicking and so wrong at the same time. Michigan is the academic powerhouse of the two. It has virtually no academic weakness.  Recruiters and other universities know this.<br><br>", "<b>Username: J123D123</b><br><br>Both Colleges are Strong academically.  You cannot go wrong at either.  More school ( Public Policy, Engineering etc ) specific or degree major/minor specific in deciding between the two on this point is likely the only way to weigh the differences here.<br>That and the college Campus experience you seek most.<br>Either College will equally prepare \u201cone\u201d for graduate school or the real world equally well.  Though the major/minor options is key to your choice here as you will find your \u201cinterest\u201d matter most.  Always\u2026<br>Look at the Program specific offerings and the professors and make a few phone calls.<br>PS: Having no academic weakness does not pass the smell test.  Any student who excels say Straught A\u2019s at either school in there area of \u201cinterest\u201d will be highly reguarded at either school.  The differences will be student specific at the interview.  UVA will not remake you with prestiege over UofM nor vis-\u00e0-vis.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sushiritto</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>It has VIRTUALLY no academic weakness<br>\"\"<br><br>The operative word of the poster\u2019s thought is not zero weakness, but almost no weakness.<br>UMich has 40 LSA programs ranked in the Top 10 and someone else pointed out on another thread that there\u2019s probably another 10-20 programs right around that Top 10-ish ranking. For example, the math department is ranked #12.<br>https://lsa.umich.edu/lsa/news-events/all-news/lsa-in-the-news/forty-lsa-programs-in-the-top-ten\u2013says-new-u-s\u2013news-rankings.html<br><br>", "<b>Username: J123D123</b><br><br>I like what Forbes has to say about what it looks at in ranking colleges\u2026<br>\u201cThe Forbes list is notable also for the things it doesn\u2019t measure, like SAT scores and acceptance rates, statistics we call \u201cinputs.\u201d We think students are more interested in \u201coutputs.\u201d\u201d<br>Here UofM is Ranked 22 and UVA is ranked 34.<br>If you do like the colleges do in deciding on students it\u2019s more of Holistic approach that is individual specific when narrowing various schools.<br>Look at that Forbes 2018 list and for D18 any number of schools fall of the list rapidly.  The too small schools through Tufts go away.  The Military Academies go away.  Narrowing to leaving Vanderbilt, Rice, USC and John\u2019s Hopkins to choose from between UofM and UVA for D18.<br>Never considered Rice.  USC is across the country and just way too far away to consider.  John\u2019s Hopkins wasn\u2019t a good fit so she didn\u2019t even Apply.<br>Vanderbilt is the only one true school between UofM and UVA on that Forbes list that D18 would have considered from her own Holistic Perspective\u2026<br>So generic lists serve only one purpose.

Otherwise go to the cheapest.  There is no reason to incur more debt when law school is a possibility.<br><br>", "<b>Username: J123D123</b><br><br>All things being equil look directly at the program of interest at both schools and dig in deep.  D18 did and decided on UVA for her specific interest.  That said UofM was a close second among many options.<br>If D18 gets accepted off the Georgetown or NotreDame waitlist another Holistic decision will need to be made at that point in time and maybe a forfeit of deposit\u2026<br>Both UofM and UVA are Great Schools.  Both have their Strengths and Weaknesses.<br>PS:  You should call UVA and clearly understand your financial aid offer.  Im not so sure that $10,000 isn\u2019t already your responsibility.  It\u2019s kind of fuzzy they way you describe/understand it.  It\u2019s typically presented in Black and White.  So best to ask directly what they mean to best make your decision\u2026<br>While Villanova gave us a wonderful financial aid package they also worded the out of pocket costs to sound like some other sort of aid\u2026  so each school has its own nomenclature and it sounded nice the way they put it but that part was our responsibility.<br>Call UVA tomorrow and be clear on what\u2019s aid and what\u2019s your responsibility.  Also ask if it renews each year.<br>Neither school is worth more than $5,000 per year over the other to satisfy other than minor holistic differences all other things being equil unless of course you have some really great reason out of the norm like a dying to get into program of study\u2026<br>UofM may in fact be the better option financially as they do target certain specific cohorts whereas ( UVA ) across the board looks to meet need up to ones EFC for all students.

You have two outstanding choices from my perspective.  I went to UVA Law and have two First Year sons at UVA, but I love Michigan and its great sports traditions.  Also, Michigan offered me my first law school admit, which means it will forever hold a place in my heart.  Had my sons wanted to attend Michigan, I would have been thrilled (and in need of some major winter wear).<br>I\u2019m writing you, however, to offer my opinion that life on Grounds for First Years offers a much broader social experience than the stereotypes suggest.  My guys, too, were concerned about UVA\u2019s drunken-frat-guy-preppy reputation, as neither was interested in the party or Greek scene.   But once on Grounds they had no problem finding friends and activities outside that scene. Both are competing in a club sport, write for the school paper, and one auditioned for an improv group, made it, and has surprised all previous acquaintances by being funny.  They also volunteer coach a local kids\u2019 sports team and are members of clubs concerning media and film.  Outside of organized activities, they see more than their fair share of football and basketball games, play pick-up Spikeball, assemble intramural teams, attend music and arts festivals on the Downtown Mall, see Marvel flicks, hike Skyline Drive and the Blue Ridge, hunt for food trucks, go to speaking events re politics, law, comedy and the arts, dine on wings and sushi at the Corner, etc.  They\u2019ve had an amazing experience.<br>Again, I offer this description not to advise you to choose UVA over Michigan, but to let you know that with 14,000 students and 600+ clubs, it\u2019s not too hard to find likeminded friends at UVA.  Both are terrific schools, and as I\u2019ve said before, 90% of your college experience has nothing to do with the school you select but rather your readiness for college.  Do you attend your \u201cwelcome\u201d dorm and freshman events and make an effort to meet people?  Do you check out clubs and organizations and join the 2-3 that most excite you?  Do you speak up in class, go to office hours, and find advisors and mentors?  Do you attend class, do the readings, and supplement your legible notes?  Do you take advantage of the speakers, artists, and other random spectacles that visit your college?  These are the kinds of things that will contribute to a terrific four years, not choosing #18 over #25.  Good luck!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: GoBlue81</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>I would like to do research with profs, so this is a definite plus<br>\"\"<br><br>You can do research as a first semester freshman at Michigan under the UROP program.

My guys do a club sport, coach for a kids\u2019 team in that sport, write for the school paper, are involved in a film club that also hosts weekly strategy game nights, seem to be constantly involved in some intramural competition, and one of them performs improv with a popular group on campus.

Madison House is the volunteer center that can hook your kid up with short or long-term projects with other students who share your interests.  Through the outdoor center, you can take classes or weekend trips with kids who like hiking, fishing, climbing, etc.  Through the rec center you can take fitness classes or join an intramural team. And there\u2019s tons of academic, political, film, dance, acapella, cooking, quidditch and every other kind of club in existence.<br>I understand your concerns.  My sons shared them.  But like many UVA students, their biggest problem is there\u2019s just too many activities in which they\u2019d like to be involved.  And that doesn\u2019t count the quintessential UVA fun like hiking the Blue Ridge and Skyline Drive, festivals on the Downtown Mall, wings and smoothies on the Corner, apple-picking, day trips to amusement parks, and attending basketball, football and other D1 sports events.<br>Good luck with your decisions!!
