I made a thread before asking this but didn\u2019t know enough about my financial situation. Central Michigan University is full tuition and housing covered with a $500 stipend for books all 4 years.

While Michigan class size is about twice the size (7,000) as Central Michigan (3,500?) yet 8x as many Michigan students as Central Michigan students apply to med school. This shows that Michigan has many more students competing against each other for high gpa which is needed for med school. And the academic credentials (stat-wise) of the students at Michigan are much higher than Central Michigan. Michigan\u2019s ACT 25/75 percentile range is 30-33 whereas Central Michigan is 19-25. It will be much more difficult for you to maintain a high gpa at Michigan than it will at Central Michigan. Med schools are more concerned with high gpa and MCAT scores than they are with the particular undergraduate school you go to.

Admission to MD programs in the United States is incredibly difficult.  At a standard school, perhaps between 20-40% of students (sometimes even more at some schools) may enter as pre-med.  The VAST majority of them will switch because they change their mind or (even more likely) they will be forced to change their mind due to the rigors of the pre-med process with its many weed-outs.  Statistically speaking, you will VERY probably not make it.  This might sound mean, but it is the truth.  You may want to consider hedging your bets.  A Central Michigan degree, in most cases, is worth a lot less than a Michigan degree when it comes to contingency jobs/grad school programs that are popular for former pre-med students or pre-med students who will be applying (or re-applying) to med school later on (medical scribe positions, lab tech positions, good MPH programs, etc.).

But the undergrad school and the experiences there may matter for which medical school the student gets into.  I have seen this play out to some extent with students in my classes.  There is also some carry-forward from the undergraduate degree later in life.<br>romanigypsyeyes, if the OP were asking about the University of Michigan vs. a full ride at Michigan State, I would have to think very much longer about what to advise, and the University of Michigan might not win for an undergraduate pre-med.  The University of Michigan is higher-ranked, but UM/MSU are more like each other than either is like Central.<br><br>", "<b>Username: wis75</b><br><br>Most good physicians, even those who teach, do not want the extremely elite schools.

There is, as well, a non-zero probability that the applicant will choose a different major or a different career after being exposed to the far-ranging curriculum opportunities in college. One of the reasons for attending college is to discover possible career interests and alternatives, as well as aptitudes that can hardly be known in high school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: romanigypsyeyes</b><br><br>@QuantMech I\u2019m aware that MSU and CMU aren\u2019t similarly ranked. However, I don\u2019t put nearly as much stock in prestige as many on this forum do. I was told repeatedly when I was deciding between the two that I was an idiot for turning down U of M.<br>I think where you\u2019re comfortable IS important to a college decision.

He/she has the best chance of a higher gpa at Central Michigan and it is a full ride/zero cost/no debt! Central Michigan has a med school so the OP can have a chance to shadow doctors perhaps engage in research there. And he/she can stand out from his/her peers academically. In contrast, if the OP went to Michigan, I think he/she would face an uneven playing field\u2014he/she would be competing against one of the wealthiest student bodies (the 45% out-of-state students, most of whom are in the one percentile of family wealth, and who come into Michigan with some of the highest stats of any students in the country, and thus they have the resources to pay for private tutors for difficult premed classes, have family connections for medical internships and shadowing, & can afford the best test prep course for MCAT)\u2014-this would be the OP\u2019s competition\u2014 plus the competition against the highest achieving students from in-state Michigan high schools. So the OP faces an uphill battle right from the start against his/her premed classmates for earning top tier gpa and overall med school credentials which are needed to gain entrance to medical schools. Because medical schools will pick the best candidates from each school. The OP has a better chance of being the best med school candidate at Central Michigan. And if he/she changes his mind after freshman or sophomore year and decided against premed/med school, then he/she can likely be able to transfer to Michigan and earn that coveted University of Michigan degree.<br><br>", "<b>Username: QuantMech</b><br><br>romanigypsyeyes, I am not making a recommendation based on the prestige of the University of Michigan vs. Central Michigan.  My recommendations are always based on the quality of the educational experience available at the two universities (well, practically always).   There is essentially zero faculty movement between the University of Michigan and Central Michigan University.  The only counter-example to this would be that perhaps sometimes the Central Michigan University faculty take a sabbatical at the University of Michigan.  The courses delivered at the University of Michigan in my field are just substantially better than the courses at Central Michigan.<br>trackmbe3\u2019s post #58 is an example of what is wrong with the current medical school admissions process:  A student whose actual performance is at the same level is much more likely to have a high GPA at Central than at the University of Michigan (I think this is true).  That yields a higher probability of admission to medical school, presumptively.  But this is not necessarily so.  I know of one student with a 3.95 from a less competitive college who did not get into any medical school that offers an MD.<br>A student does not need to have family connections to participate in medically related research at the University of Michigan.  Family connections and wealth are being over-valued by trackmbe3.  While tutors can no doubt help, it is actually possible to do very well in classes at the University of Michigan without a tutor, by being reasonably intelligent and working hard.  A student would need to be able to purchase the course books on time, and I know that can be a challenge for some students.<br><br>", "<b>Username: QuantMech</b><br><br>If you go to<br>https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/education/md-program/our-community/students-faculty/admitted-class-profile<br>you can see the undergraduate colleges of the medical students at the University of Michigan in each year.<br>Clicking on the earlier year\u2019s data, you can see for example for the entering class in 2018, 47 were undergraduates at the University of Michigan, and two or fewer came from Central Michigan.<br><br>", "<b>Username: midwest_mom9</b><br><br>I am a professor and pre-med advisor at CMU. I disagree that the basic premed courses are defacto better at U-M. We teach many intro bio and chem courses in active learning classrooms with fewer than 100 students, using innovative and engaging pedagogy. When I toured Mich. with my son, the tour guide had never heard of active learning classrooms. It will really depend on the student as to which environment will work best for them to learn the material. We have many students who turn down Mich because of the full ride at CMU, and most do very well, going on to med and grad school. It is true, of course, that CMU doesn\u2019t have the cache of Mich, and if your aspirations include very selective med schools, then Mich. May be worth the cost. If you hope for an in- state med school, other than Mich., schools like CMU will prepare you very well for the MCAT and success.<br><br>", "<b>Username: wis75</b><br><br>Nice post above.  The truth is that the vast majority of premed students do not want the top few medical schools.  Remember- even the lowest standing graduate of the last ranked medical school will have earned the MD degree and qualify for licensure after meeting a state\u2019s requirements.  They all can be competent physicians.  This is unlike law schools and some other post grad programs.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ChoatieMom</b><br><br>Both my (retired) in-laws were faculty at CMU.  FIL chaired a department for many years.  CMU has made vast improvements in its programs in the decades since I first became related to this family and now has a very solid reputation.  My SIL pursued an MBA at Central and is now CIO for one of the largest counties in the country.  Many here post similar anecdotes from other non-U-M universities.  I believe engaged students can get where they want to go from just about any school.  CMU will do the job just fine for the OP if s/he stays on the pre-med course.  If money were no issue, I would say that U-M is the better choice for breadth of programs if the OP changes course, but money is an issue, so CMU seems a no-brainer to me.<br><br>", "<b>Username: toomanyteens</b><br><br>Full ride all the way<br><br>", "<b>Username: 3js3ks</b><br><br>I think that you have to look at the full picture of what both schools offer.
