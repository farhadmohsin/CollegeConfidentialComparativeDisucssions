I'm a first year humanities student and I haven't found it overwhelming, but know lots of people that have. The difference between Cal and a LAC is they will not hold your hand at Cal. You can have great access to professors, most of which are top in the field, but you have to put in the effort by going to office hours, talking to them after class, and actively participating in class. As far as class size, it varies dramatically class to class and major to major. Assume that most of your intro classes will be large and with upper division class size greatly reduced. There are opportunities for small classes in your first two years though (I've taken 2 semesters of Spanish with less than 20 people and 2 freshman seminars each with 15 people). All lecture classes have discussion sections led by Grad students that tend to have between 20-30 people in them. Like with getting to know your professors, it is on you to get involved on campus. I too came from a big high school so this wasn't a problem and I love everything I've gotten involved with. A lot of the social scene comes from clubs.

Prospective students must be incredibly confused. I understand why this is the case because my son just graduated from UCB. He worked harder than Ive ever seen a student work, but finished with an amazing education and great job prospects. Highly motivated, self directed students thrive at UCB.

My sophomore D - always academically driven - is doing very well as a STEM major at an extremely tough university. Working her tail off, but then she did that in high school, too. She's figuring out how to get what she needs from a large university with a lot of resources but not a lot of hand holding. Club director, undergraduate research, and a paid summer internship: not too shabby for a kid from a mid-level public high school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: LittleBear83</b><br><br>The class sizes really vary a lot by major. Philosophy is one of the larger Humanities majors, and has a mix of some classes that are around 15-20, and some that get up to 100. English is the same. But a lot of majors have much smaller classes - based on the interests you mentioned, I'd suggest considering Classics or Comparative Literature. The language programs are also really small, and once you get to the upper-division levels, you're basically studying literature but just in another language.<br><br>As someone else mentioned, you do have to make the effort to get to know your professors but they will be more than happy to help you. They love students who are passionate about their subject and want to go into academia. Also, you can take freshman seminars starting your first semester, and they're capped at 15 students, I think.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bigfandave</b><br><br>Im sorry....no way UCB isnt better than the best LACs? Youve just lost all credibility. UCB for Grad School makes much more sense. And what is the best way to get into UCB Grad School?

There is no way that going to an LAC could be seen as better, or could open more doors for you into grad school or jobs. UC Berkeley is by far your better choice. That $200,000 debt would be your parents, not yours, since students are limited in how much money they can borrow for undergraduate degrees ($5,500-$7,500 a year max).

Faculty hiring also tends to favor PhD school prestige in major, so you need to go to PhD school that is top ranked in major.
