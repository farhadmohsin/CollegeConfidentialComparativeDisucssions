You can get a great non-STEM education at either place.<br>Reputation/Prestige - top graduate schools and employers are aware of both schools.<br>Location - W&M hands-down, the winner. Nothing quite like being part of a historic Colonial restoration project.<br>Facilities and resources - Again, I don't think either school has a clear advantage here. Once you step off the mainly historic quads, the facilities get quite modern.<br>Value of cost - Here's where it gets dicey. You're probably paying OOS tuition for a public university at W&M. For essentially the same amount of money you would be sharing space with three times the number of total students (grad and undergrad) and larger classes than you would at Wesleyan. Also, not to put too fine a point on it - two thirds of your classmates at W&M will be from the same state.<br>Safety - Crime is a scary thing whenever it happens, especially on a quiet campus. According to Clery Statistics Wesleyan has a big lead in reported rape cases. Some people argue that it is because Wesleyan does a better job at encouraging people to report such occurrences. Either way, it's not a pretty statistic <br>Outcome/opportunities (chance to get into top grad schools/career development) - IMO, it depends on what you make of your opportunities (i.e., grades and test scores.)<br>Food and dorm - Wesleyan has an unusual graduated independent living approach to student housing with hundreds of small houses dotting the campus.

Wes is a much smaller school, yet sponsors more varsity teams. Furthermore, the bar for athletic talent is relatively low, since Wes is a Division III school. So Wes has lots of athletic participation: about 21.5% of enrolled students are varsity athletes. The rate for W&M is much lower, only about 8.2%.<br>If you are interested in following intercollegiate athletics as a fan, then W&M is better, because it is a Division I school with serious athletes playing on athletic scholarships. However, the difference may not be great as you might expect. W&M plays football at the D1-FCS level, which is still \u201cminor league\u201d as far as the average college football fan is concerned. W&M is theoretically eligible for the NCAA basketball tournament, but has never actually qualified. So W&M sports, while entertaining, aren\u2019t generally featured prominently on national media, as UVa or Virginia Tech games might be.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Corbett</b><br><br><br>Funk<br><br>If you are going to compare these two particular schools, you should really be aware of the pronounced differences in funkiness.

However, you can tour Williamsburg in about a day, then when the novelty wears off, you\u2019re out in the boondocks 2.5 hours from Washington DC. Middletown is roughly the same distance to NYC, but maybe a little less to Boston and fairly close to many other college campuses. On balance, I think I\u2019d prefer Wesleyan\u2019s location \u2026 but not for ~$10K/year more (if location were the only difference that mattered to me).<br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br><br>[QUOTE=\"\"]<br><br>Funk&lt;<br><br>[/QUOTE]<br><br>LOL.

It is so old and full of history \u2013 perhaps more than any other US school \u2013 that the campus is almost a museum. W&M students tend to embrace this heritage.<br>Wesleyan, on the other hand, has students that are known for rejecting tradition, and experimenting with new ideas, even ideas that may initially seem crazy. Funky = new, different, crazy; could be either good or bad. Wesleyan is perhaps funkier than another US school.<br>So these two schools \u2013 though both academically strong \u2013 have very different \u201cpersonalities\u201d.

Thank you then. Well, for international students from China, we tend to look at schools only by their rankings. And that definitely shapes our thinking process.<br>I probably portray myself as a pretty typical Asian/Chinese on this site, but I don\u2019t normally study a lot or very hard. I basically just muddled through my super competitive middle school in Shanghai usually in the top 30-40% without much dedication.<br>So what do I do for fun? I watch movies in the movie theatres, go to different types of concerts, see some drama or plays once in a while, play basketball and tennis sometimes, go to the gym to work out every day in summer when I\u2019m in Shanghai, try out different restaurants with family and friends, and most importantly, travel. I have traveled a lot with my parents and it has become a family tradition. I\u2019ve visited over 15 countries in Europe, Asia, and America by far. There\u2019s nothing like being physically present in a foreign land to discover everything that you might have heard other people talking about. I learned various cultures, removed stereotypes, and perceived my own country from a new perspective. I just love traveling. It has and will continue to help me become more cosmopolitan.<br>Hopefully that answers your question.<br><br>", "<b>Username: admissionsrep93</b><br><br>I highly disagree with some of people\u2019s descriptions on W&M. It is traditional, true, but their learning experience and philosophies require for great intellectual thinking as well as new and informed thought processes. Aside from that there are many flaws within Wesleyan such as a huge influx in tuition and only 2 credits of AP transfers. W&M is just the better choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br>Thanks, @jackwang0703 . I was worried that your head would explode at Wesleyan. But, far from it.

But I do think that Wes (for better or worse) is a significantly funkier place than the College of William and Mary, and that an informed decision about the two schools should include consideration of this point.<br>I would say the same thing if someone was comparing, say, Reed College vs. Washington & Lee. They are both highly regarded LACs, with comparable admissions standards, and each can be a great fit for the right person. But most people would have a distinct preference for one school or the other, and this is in part because one school is much funkier than the other.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jackwang0703</b><br><br>Now I\u2019m starting to consider the more diverse yet still fairly traditional, Richmond again, in comparison to W&M.<br>The reason I didn\u2019t completely take Richmond out of the list is that it has the best reviews on Niche in terms of quality of life including food, dorm, campus, location.<br>I\u2019m not sure about its academics though. I know it probably has the best business program among the three, but as far as academics and prestige in general, I think it is at a lower level perhaps slightly.

Richmond is absolutely incredible for what you would want to study, if that is buisness, and aside from that it is everything W&M is and more, just without the rankings for some odd reason, I do agree and see that. If rankings matter to you, do W&M, if not Richmond is an excellent choice!<br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br>@jackwang - Believe me, downtown Richmond makes Middletown, CT look positively cosmopolitan by comparison. You will either need a car for quick trips to Washington, D.C. or satisfy yourself with living in a bubble - a comfortable bubble - but, one that pretty much has to import all of its entertainment because hardly anyone majors in the arts. Subtract the approximately 1,100 business and marketing majors from U Richmond\u2019s student body and you have the smallest number of liberal arts students among any of the colleges on your short list.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jackwang0703</b><br><br>@circuitrider Oh really?

Their classes are nowhere near professional in the area of buisness and their studies are VERY liberal. I heard of a trump supporter who wasn\u2019t allowed to go to his classes because kids were rioting so much. While this is social justice, it is intense.

A majority of students from Virginia, but the rest from all over the world.<br>Wesleyan:  a small liberal arts college with small classes and a really personal experience; you will know your professors and classmates well. Delightfully quirky, outside-the-box students mix with a range of students, including everything from athletes to artists-- with some artists going on to do amazing things in film, TV, theater, etc. Close enough to New York City for a day trip on a weekend day. Students from a full range of states and countries all over the world.<br>How do you feel about a liberal atmosphere (not intolerant as one poster implied, but definitely an experimental type of place) with a great sense of community and small intimate classes, versus a larger-- though still not overly large-- school with a much more traditional feel and a mix of class sizes?
