Penn (along with Cornell) was the easiest ivy to get into back in the 1980s. It has been 30-35+ years since then. Also at that time Stanford was an afterthought to HYP. Look where it is now, vying for top spot with Harvard. Things do change over the decades. if you had looked at say 1920s-30s things would also be different compared to the 80s.  Penn improved tremendously starting at the late 80s and throughout the 1990s. And so did Columbia. Of course the characteristics and relative positions have changed.<br>Just being objective here. HYP still remains the top of the ivies but Columbia and Penn have made grater progress than Dartmouth, Brown, Cornell and for the past 15-20 years they have been consistently seen as stronger universities than Dartmouth, Brown, Cornell.

All of these kids had the opportunity to attend a flagship Big 10 school for less money, but the parents believed that NU, despite the higher tuition, offered a significant ROI. Most of the students from our HS who attend NU are very serious, pre-professional students who have a firm idea of what they want to do in their four years on campus and where they want to be when they graduate.

But you saw the little bit that you saw and then extrapolated that out.<br>The fact remains that when it comes to alumni achievements, NU is right there with the lower Ivies, so either the student bodies are comparable or whatever extra stuff adcoms select for don\u2019t actually matter in the real world.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PennCAS2014</b><br><br>So this really comes down to your own personal preferences. Despite what some of the people on this thread would have you believe, Penn and Columbia are indeed usually considered a notch above Northwestern and Dartmouth. But contrary to what a lot of 17 year olds think, that notch won\u2019t really mean all that much at the end of your time there. Here\u2019s where it will matter:<br><br>If you MIGHT want to go into business, there is no better school to attend than Penn. Because of Penn's one university policy, students across Penn's four undergraduate colleges (The College, Wharton, Nursing, and Engineering) all have access to the same exact career services and thus have access to all of the best recruiters and opportunities in business. Top employers come to Penn as a consequence of Penn's preeminent business school and they end up recruiting at all four of Penn's undergrad schools. And it doesn't hurt that you can take classes, join clubs, and do research across Penn's four undergraduate schools and its numerous graduate and professional schools, allowing you to add experience at Wharton or Penn Law to your resume, bolstering your chances even more. This is important because some firms only recruit at Penn, Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford. (http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/percolator/brown-and-cornell-are-second-tier/27565) The research from that study actually came from a scholar at Northwestern ironically enough. Thus, attending Penn gives you access to recruiters that won't even look at a northwestern grad. And I can speak from personal experience on this matter- because I was a student in Penn's College of arts & sciences who was recruited to work at an organization that only recruited in a meaningful way at Harvard, Penn, Yale, Stanford, Columbia, and Princeton (there are others here to be sure, just not in any significant numbers).<br><br>From the article: \u201cThey meet hundreds of applicants at career fairs. Rather than scrutinizing anyone\u2019s resume it\u2019s easier just to limit the pool to the top three or four universities. Do you really want to pore over the transcript of that kid from the University of Michigan? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier just to call the Harvard grad? In essence, what they\u2019re assuming is that the admissions offices at the super-elite schools have already picked the best of the best. Why second guess them?\u201d<br>Also from the article-- \u201cHere\u2019s what a top consultant had to say about M.I.T.: You will find it when you go to like career fairs or something and you know someone will show up and say, you know, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t go to HBS [Harvard Business School] but, you know, I am an engineer at M.I.T. and I heard about this fair and I wanted to come meet you in New York.\u201d God bless him for the effort but, you know, it\u2019s just not going to work.\u201d<br>For the most elite circles of business, pedigree matters (whether or not that\u2019s fair), and Penn has the connections, regardless of whether you\u2019re an engineer or a whartonite, etc., to connect you to the most exclusive opportunities. And Penn publishes comprehensive career services data to back that up-- you can easily compare it to any other school willing to make their data public.<br><br>Networking- People on college confidential just love being reductionist about the ivy league. At the end of the day, it's not just a sports conference, it's a networking opportunity. While you're still an undergrad, you will have a lot of interaction with the other Ivies by virtue of the fact that we kind of do everything together. Sure, our sports teams play one another and that's fun. But our student councils meet to discuss how they can work together. There is an Ivy League Latino conference. There is an ivy league inter-faith conference. There is a conference of first generation college students in the Ivy League. And the list goes on... Our student newspapers report on significant events at the other 7 schools. We participate in coordinated community service events. We host debate tournaments that are only for other ivy leaguers. Our literary societies host one another for intellectual discussions. Our secret societies and senior societies host mixers with each other. We go to each other's parties and spring flings. Our girlfriends and boyfriends and brothers and sisters and gender nonconforming family and friends all go to other ivies and broaden our networks so that when we leave college, we don't just know the kids we graduated with but we have a dense network of other HIGHLY motivated, accomplished and successful peers. It means that I can walk into any room of elite professionals in an American city (and many international ones) and be confident that I'll find someone there who went to Dartmouth or Princeton with whom I can bond over our shared ivy experience. It also means that any time I need an introduction to another professional, I am never more than one degree of separation from the person I'd like to meet because the network is so tight. And we don't stop building it after we graduate. Instead, the Ivy alumni clubs all have club houses within a few blocks of each other in Manhattan and they hold Inter-club events all the time (they do this in all of America's major cities as well and many international ones too- especially London). There are ivy-only career fairs and ivy only social mixers. There are even ivy-only speed dating opportunities. Your affiliation with the Ivy League opens doors that just can't be opened elsewhere. Going to any amazing college (like northwestern or georgetown) will open more doors than you can ever have time in your life to take advantage of; Going to an ivy opens those same doors and more. <br><br>In all honesty, an undergraduate education at Yale will be pretty similar in terms of quality to an undergraduate education at Vanderbilt. Your undergrad years and your success afterwards will genuinely be crafted almost exclusively by the effort you put into learning what you want to learn and doing what you want to do. But going to an Ivy (especially Penn, Princeton, Harvard, Columbia and Yale) will make your entrance into some of the most notoriously elitist and closed sectors of professional and social life that much easier. But if you don\u2019t care about those things\u2026 well, then the significance of the ivy league ceases to matter when comparing them to Northwestern.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Boothie007</b><br><br>I mostly agree with Alexandre\u2019s assessment<br>Notch above:  HYP, Columbia, Penn - Wharton<br>Same, but different:  Dartmouth, Brown<br>Basically the same:  Penn - Other, Northwestern, Cornell<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>Northwestern is an academic powerhouse on par with (at least) Penn, Brown, Cornell and Dartmouth in terms of overall undergraduate academic strength \u2013 and in STEM they\u2019re probably stronger than mighty Yale and Columbia (whose most impressive strengths lie elsewhere).<br>So yes, academically, Northwestern is quite comparable to the Ivies.<br>With that bit of Big Ten chest-thumping out of the way, I think that while it sounds like there will be about a $20k advantage for Northwestern over four years, if your family is comfortable paying the extra money for an Ivy \u2013 and if you feel that you are a better fit for one than you are for Northwestern \u2013 then by all means, choose the better fit.
