I think any school on your list (maybe except for West Chester) that you can go to without borrowing more than that is worth considering. People may say to save the money and use it for medical school, but you and your parents don\u2019t actually have any money. It\u2019s a question of whether when you apply to medical school (with a potential further debt of $200K) you have a debt of $27K or zero. It could be that the advantages of a number of those schools will be worth the difference. And if you end up not going to medical school, at least you\u2019d have a debt you could reasonably handle and a degree from a better school.<br>Borrowing $50K or $100K, for several reasons, is really not a good idea. If you don\u2019t get into medical school, you might not be able to handle that much debt and the banks might go after your co-signer.

Normally, I say take the full ride (or close to it) and take advantage of what you might see as a less desirable situation.  There are plenty of people, not just doctors but also faculty members, who started off at very modest schools.<br>That said, the ground is littered with the bones of hopeful pre-med students.  I am not trying to be negative, for indeed perhaps you have the determination, perseverance, and intelligence to successfully become a doctor.  At the same time, I remember very bright friends who were pre-med but ended up switching.  One switched to pre-law and is now a lawyer.  Another switched to dental and is now\u2013wait for it!\u2013a dentist!<br>I guess I\u2019m saying that one of the things you should take into account is how happy you will be at Cabrini, personally and in terms of academics, if, God forbid, there\u2019s a change of plans.  I feel like a hypocrite because normally I tell students not to get so hung up on the name or prestige of a place, and I still believe that, yet I\u2019ve never heard of Cabrini, and I know just about every school in this country (all of the other schools on your list, including Marist and West Chester, I am familiar with).<br>But perhaps Cabrini is a hidden gem.  I had to Google it to be honest: a small Catholic LAC.  The good news is that it is small, which means you should be able to get the personalized attention that you need.  In general, LACs have much higher acceptance rates to medical schools than large universities.  The reasons should be obvious.  Instead of being in an intro Bio class with 100 students, you\u2019ll be in smaller classes from the get-go.  Instead of hunting down a professor who doesn\u2019t know you (because you\u2019re one of many), you\u2019ll be able to walk up to your professor at Cabrini for one-on-one help.  LACs don\u2019t generate as much research as R1 universities, of course, but what research opportunities there are go to undergraduates since there are no graduate students to compete with.  I should note, however, that the higher rates for medical/professional/graduate school are mostly at selective LACs (not necessarily cutthroat but selective; a school like Beloit or Willamette or Dickinson would fit this description).<br>I sort of like the other options on your list more than Cabrini, though perhaps I am not following my own advice (caring more about name than opportunity).  Is it worth getting into debt?  For the most part, no.  However, moderate debt is the reality for most college students.  Is West Chester worth the extra 6K per year?  I\u2019m not sure, but Dickinson might be, especially if, say, you change majors.  The Dickinson education would be top notch (it\u2019s the strongest school on your list).<br>You do have tough choices, and I apologize that after all of this blabbering I haven\u2019t really helped you much.

I doubt West Chester is worth $24,000 more than Cabrini.<br>I think some of the better schools, like Northeastern, UMass, UVM, Delaware, or Dickinson may be worth the $27K in loans over Cabrini. But it depends if they also require much from your family, and whether that\u2019s an amount that would be hard for them to pay.

I have many friends who have graduate from both and gone on to have successful lives.  Granted the people I know have gone into business, nursing, music and teaching not pre-med. I do know a biology grad who works in pharm. research who is a WCU grad.<br>I realize that many posters don\u2019t know much about the area or these schools so I feel I have something to share here. The OP probably knows all of this but maybe it will help with those giving advice.   West Chester is a very well regarded PA state directional.  The state flagships in PA (Penn State, Pitt, and Temple) are EXTREMELY pricey for the average Pennsylvania family and out of reach for all but the tippy top students of those with low income or income insecurity.  They do not provide many scholarships for in state students except for the cream of the crop and those are typically pretty lean. They do not meet need. Most people here on CC have heard about the problems with PA higher ed.<br>This leaves plenty of average excellent students studying at our directionals and WCU is one of the better, if not best, ones.  It is in an outstanding location.  It is suburban but 45 minutes from downtown Philadelphia and 30 minutes from downtown Wilmington, DE. Plenty to do on and around campus.  It is no longer a small suitcase school.  It is growing, has a lovely campus, great dorms, lots of job opportunities nearby, a large (and growing) regional hospital in town 2 miles from the campus that is affiliated with Penn.  More and more often neighbors and friends of top students are sending their children to WCU for 3 years (on scholarship) for a physics degree and then on to Penn State U. for 2 years for engineering degrees on a 3:2 program.  They have degrees from both (physics from WCU and then engineering from PSU) for half of the price. I have heard nothing but great things about the quality of teaching there.   OP should not feel like they are left with bad choices if WCU and Cabrini end up the only reasonable choices.<br>Drexel will likely be out of reach financiall and they are well known around here for not honoring their first year aide in subsequent years.  Plenty of coworkers and friends who have had to try and get back merit $ that they thought was for all 4 years but is actually not. Great school but something to you should watch for if it seems like you can make it work in year 1 - make sure to ask them about this. Temple has been generous in the past but does not seem to be in the position to extend as much aide as in the past and the state flagships do not meet need.  If you could make Temple work, I might take on some debt (no more than the federal student limit) because of its size and proximity to world class medical centers in Philly.  I do not think Uof D is worth the money and the price differential for OOS is likely huge.  If they give you lots of $ it may be in play but I would not pay extra for it over any of the other choices - including Cabrini.<br>Cabrini is a very small and very specialized little school.  Caring people and personal service.  I know many teachers who came through Cabrini and loved it. It does have the feel of a suitcase school and lots of part time students which can account for the low graduation rate. I do not have any other first hand knowledge of Cabrini.<br>Keep us updated as your offers come in. I am pulling for you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Elly710</b><br><br>@bamamom2021 Thank you so much for the insight!! WCU for me is hand in hand with Cabrini, just a few thousand dollars more though.

Do NOT just ask for numbers/percentages.  Especially in a small school those are totally unreliable (they are in large schools too) and many schools consider Caribbean med schools to be just fine and dandy to include in their stats.  Not all pre-med students want to go to Caribbean med schools.  (Ditto with DO - they appeal to some, but not all and are often included in stats.)

Although at times my daughter still wishes she could have gone to Temple (or Pitt), I think West Chester is growing on her.  Her first semester wasn\u2019t ideal, as she had several professors/instructors that weren\u2019t very good.  She chose her classes/sections carefully for 2nd semester and seems to be happier with her courses.  She has joined the climbing club, which she really enjoys, as well as some other clubs.  She really likes the town of West Chester, which has a bustling downtown.  Not quite the city life she was craving, but very pleasant.   She is looking forward to living in an off-campus apartment next year, even though the traditional dorms are actually pretty nice and much less expensive than \u201caffiliated housing\u201d.  She wouldn\u2019t even consider smaller schools, so she picked the PASSHE school that was the largest (and arguably the best).  I don\u2019t know much about Cabrini so I can\u2019t comment on whether it would be a better choice than West Chester.  I live close to Carlisle and took classes at Dickinson as a high school student back in the dark ages.  It is an excellent school and I hope you are admitted there.

I\u2019ll make sure to carefully pick my courses and join a few clubs while I\u2019m there!<br><br>", "<b>Username: juillet</b><br><br>@OHMomof2 @Elly710 A 4/4 school refers to the teaching courseload of the professors. The first number refers to how many classes the teachers teach in the fall, and the second in the spring. Elite research universities may offer their professors a 2/2 or 2/1 load - meaning they teach two classes in the fall and one or two in the spring (or vice versa). Because they\u2019re only teaching 3-4 classes a year, they have more time to do research - which makes up the bulk of their job anyway. (Sometimes, if they win a grant, they can even buy themselves out of the few classes they do teach, reducing their courseload even more. I knew some professors at Columbia who only taught 1 or 2 classes a year.)<br>A 4/4 load, on the other hand, is one of the heaviest courseloads a professor can have. They\u2019re teaching four classes a semester, meaning that they don\u2019t really have any time during the academic year to do research. 4/4 loads are usually seen at heavy teaching schools, regional publics, tuition-driven private colleges, etc.<br>However, elite liberal arts colleges may have professors who have 3/2 or even 2/2 loads. Dickinson, for example has a 3/2 load - five courses a year - which is somewhere in the middle. This is because top LACs expect professors to also do research that they can involve undergraduates in; it also gives them more time to do individual mentoring and advisement to their students. That\u2019s how a professor can \u2018primarily teach\u2019 but still do research all year long. Very feasible for a professor at a top LAC or public honors/top regional college; not as feasible for a professor teaching eight classes a year at a public directional.<br><br><br><br>As to the dilemma: I am one of those folks that typically advises taking the full ride, but to a point. I think the OP\u2019s worry that Cabrini may not adequately prepare them for the MCAT and other medical school stuff is not completely unwarranted, since as was mentioned, Cabrini is going to be targeting their courses towards the average to below-average students they mostly admit. I think the statement that \u2018no school prepares their students for the MCAT\u2019 is technically true but not true in spirit: since the MCAT tests material that you learn in your college science classes, it follows that if you have better quality/better taught science classes that you have a better chance of doing well on the MCAT. While I don\u2019t always think higher-ranked/better-reputed schools teach better, I do think this is a different kind of comparison here.<br>But a more important point is one someone brought up on the first or second page that I really think bears repeating: A LARGE chunk of students who are pre-med before entering college are no longer pre-med by the time they graduate. Sometimes they find more interesting careers (both health and non-health); sometimes they can\u2019t get into medical school; sometimes they just don\u2019t like the pre-med curriculum, etc. While it\u2019s true that you should try to keep your debt load low if you do intend on med school, I think no student should choose a school solely on the expectation that they will go. I tell students to ask themselves: if it turns out that you don\u2019t go to med school after college (either not right away or never), and you end up doing something else, where would you like to go? Where would you like to have gone?<br>West Chester University is a pretty good school. I definitely agree with the advice to hold out for Dickinson - and also for Marist, which is also a great school. If it were me, I think I would pay the money to go to West Chester rather than attending Cabrini. But I agree that you should visit, sit in on some classes, talk to some professors, really soak it in.<br>I\u2019m not surprised that Temple and the OOS publics are too expensive; public universities rarely give much aid to non-resident students, and someone else has already discussed the issue with PA\u2019s state-related universities.

But since your interest is premed and I come from the premed section of CC I shall give you some points about premed.<br>Unless you have extensive volunteering/shadowing in the medical field, most of the HS students don\u2019t know what medicine or physician is or how to get to that status, therefore 75% of the entering college freshman  drop out of premed for one reason or the other before they hand in the application for med school. The reasons of drop out could be academic but they also could be non-academic related. Medicine career is not for everyone and you should pick a school that has premed but also has a variety of other subjects that could be interest to you. In other words, you should not use premed as a selection criteria for your college decision. To me WCU is a larger school and it is better known in PA community. WCU graduates has more employment opportunity if premed does not work out.<br>Based on you being waitlisted in Dickenson and Marist, I have an incline that medicine may not fit you. Unless you can excel in the college getting mostly As, your chances with medicine is not high. From this point on for you to get a fully board certified physician with specialty may take as much as 16 years and in that long period, other than you might pay very little in the Undergraduate stage, the medical schools are very costly and you have to borrow all the way. It is a little scary unless you absolutely committed. Moreover, there are millions of tests, standardized or otherwise are ahead of you. One slip and you are out of the race. I also see that your AP classes are mostly non-science and unless you have a high aptitude in science and biology, you will have problem in those weedout classes.<br>All in all, you should choose a larger school with more options other than premed or biology. Biology is the worst major to find a job if you cannot get into a health care professional school afterwards.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Elly710</b><br><br>@artloversplus Thank you for your advice! I was planning on switching my major at WCU from molecular biology to biochemistry, to give me a bit more freedom, should I decide med school is not for me. I will also be doing a month long internship in May, shadowing several physicians in pediatrics, maternity, geriatrics, and psychiatric wards at a well respected hospital in PA. I hope this will give me a bit of insight.<br>I see where you are coming from, I know my SAT scores and grades are not that great\u2026partly due to deeper issues, but I\u2019m certain I can pull through and really commit myself to getting top grades and doing the best I can.

Keep in mind that some years can be better than others in terms of the WL.  Also note that there is no order to the waitlist.  In general, the college will turn to the WL to accept students who best fill holes.  For instance, if the entering class is to heavily skewed toward women, a greater percentage of men might be chosen.  If a school is trying to boost its diversity figures, it might show a preference for URMs.  Diversity also means economic diversity, so that could mean trying to add a few students from lower-income families.<br>Finally, no one gets in off the waitlist without communicating with the admissions office that Dickinson remains that student\u2019s top choice and that she/he is interested in attending.  So figure that there will be some students who wrongly assume that by just accepting the WL that they are in the mix to come off the list.

I work in PA (public high school) and have literally seen thousands of students over the past 19 years.  Those who do well heading toward med school are those with a good work ethic (not choosing to major or minor in partying, but still making time to enjoy themselves with various ECs in college), not necessarily those with the highest scores on the SAT/ACT in high school (though low grades definitely aren\u2019t a good sign).<br>In an average public school (like the one I work at), there is generally only a \u201ctypical\u201d level students get education-wise.  An SAT score &gt; 1200 is often considered a great score among our top students - most of whom will attend various state schools - those college bound anyway.  When these students attend reach schools, it can be tough for them to compete because \u201call\u201d the students there have a deeper foundation than the one they were exposed to (already having great AP classes or similar), but at state schools (or similar level - state/public doesn\u2019t really make a difference in level of school) more students are entering at a similar foundational level.  Our top students with a work ethic still succeed and go on to med school if they continue to desire it (some definitely change their minds along the way).<br>It is definitely a good idea to shadow medical folks and volunteer at places like Hospice to get a feel for the real job.  That\u2019s true of any job IMO, but med school requires a bit of a commitment, so is worth the effort to be sure.<br>I wish you the best on your journey.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Elly710</b><br><br>@Hapworth Yep you are right, in my waitlist letter Dickinson said they only admitted 35 students off the waitlist, out of presumably 150+.

This 4 week internship I\u2019m doing at Bryn Mawr Hospital beginning early May, will definitly give me a new understanding to patient care and medical practice, while serving to reinforce my passion for helping others. I look forward to making the most of it!<br><br>", "<b>Username: parentologist</b><br><br>If you want to work in medicine, you will be able to do pretty much what a doctor does, by following the nurse practitioner or physician assistant track.  I had classmates in medical school who honestly weren\u2019t that bright, but had been very hard working high achieving students at mediocre colleges.  They go into med school, got through, and became doctors.  But they were VERY hard working.<br>Becoming a nurse practitioner or physician assistant takes about a tenth of the actual training hours, when you factor in that med school and residency are usually 90 hour/week training schedules.<br><br>", "<b>Username: UVAmom23</b><br><br>Good points above! I toured UT Austin and Rice with my son last week and at both places our tour guide started out premed and has switched so that is definitely common\u2026 I am married to a physician, and both my sister and sister-in-law are physicians. I would agree that work ethic is key! I did not figure that out until more than halfway through my undergraduate. The best advice I\u2019ve given my children I would give to you. The easiest way to do well in college is to not skip class! There\u2019s nothing better than sitting in the classroom, hearing what is being taught, and writing it down yourself.  Second, treat your weekday like a job. It is very easy to waste time in the middle of the day doing nothing. I discovered that if I went to the library between classes instead of to my dorm or apartment, it was much much easier to complete all my work and have a social life. Finally, you do not have to declare a difficult science major at most schools to be premed.   Depending on the rigor of your college, however, it may give you a better chance to get into med school.  My sister chose psychology because she needed a break after fulfilling the grueling premed curriculum.    At her college, psychology was one of the least rigorous. She did quite well, and got into the medical school of her choice.
