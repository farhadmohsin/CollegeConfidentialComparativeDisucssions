These are my options right now (the $ on the right is cost of attendance).<br>Amherst accepted    $45,590.00<br>Tufts   accepted    $28,542.00<br>Carleton    accepted    $21,997.00<br>Bowdoin accepted    $21,850.00<br>Emory   accepted    $19,004.00 (Also got into their Oxford side campus)<br>Davidson    accepted    $14,701.00<br>Also waitlisted @ UPenn, Vandy, WashU, Rice, Swarth, Brown, Duke, Brown, Olin (Really liked OLIN!!!)<br>For some context, my family would comfortable paying around $20,000 a year - any more would cut into my parent\u2019s retirement which I really don\u2019t want to do. I would like to study Computer Science but I also like History - want to do double major at the moment.<br>So my feasible options are Carleton, Davidson, Bowdoin, and Emory. Amherst and Tufts are too expensive, but I\u2019m appealing Amherst right now.<br>I know that Carleton\u2019s sciences is stronger than Bowdoin, but I also know that Bowdoin has many alumni connections at tech companies. I went on Bowdoin\u2019s flyout in the fall and I really liked the campus and the people. I was going to ED but my family was scared about finances. I also went on Davidson\u2019s fly out, but I didn\u2019t like the D1 athletics / bigger presence of greek life very much. However, it is a really nice LAC and it\u2019s cheaper too. But maybe they are front loading? Didn\u2019t get a chance to visit Carleton but I heard it\u2019s midwest friendly which I\u2019m a fan of.<br>So two big questions.<br><br>thoughts on which college I should choose?<br><br><br>do you think these LACs will give me a generous package freshman year only to give less the next few years? And my family's income will go about a decent amount up next year so any way to lock the package in?<br><br><br>", "<b>Username: frozencustard</b><br><br>What are your interests?  You mention science and technology.<br>If you were going to ED at Bowdoin and really enjoyed it and the money came in at a good spot, then you can\u2019t go wrong with that and it\u2019s a great school.  I would have defaulted to Emory for strength in sciences (they won\u2019t reduce your aid), but nothing in your original post indicates that you visited Emory or Oxford or know that it would be a fit for you.  You seem intrigued by Carleton.  Any way you could get out there for a visit?<br><br>", "<b>Username: alooknac</b><br><br>When comparing FinAid, you need to separate out need based aid from merit. Need based aid, anywhere, is going to change with changes in income.<br>Merit is usually renewable. Call the school to verify. Find out what GPA you need in order to keep a merit scholarship. Just because you had good grades in HS, don\u2019t assume maintaining a 3.5 at a high-ranked college will be a slam dunk. A requirement for 3.0 or 3.2 would be a better option.<br>If you study abroad, will the scholarship follow?<br>You can ask the school if all the aid is good for 4 years. Ask if it will increase if(when) tuition increases.<br>That\u2019s a great package from Davidson, and if you like it \u201cwell enough,\u201d it would be a good choice. There\u2019s a lot to be said for not being strapped financially, having money for travel costs, etc. I believe you will find that Davidson\u2019s retention and graduation rates are less than ideal. While I don\u2019t think you will become a statistic, it does have an effect on other students when 20% of the student body doesn\u2019t come back sophomore year.<br>Carleton and Bowdoin are in another league altogether, and if you get good answers about your FinAid and your family is OK with the financial stretch, I recommend going with one of them. I think you will find very high retention and graduation rates as well as education of the highest caliber.<br><br>", "<b>Username: nehiker</b><br><br>I\u2019m going to suggest that you seriously consider Tufts taking into account that it is strong for Computer Science (it has a School of Engineering) while I believe that the others are not that strong.  I know it is over the $20K, but for an extra $8K it seems like the best option for you.  Your parents would need to come up with an extra $40K or so which is not a big bite from a retirement nest egg. Does you COA include your student loans?<br><br>", "<b>Username: ScooterDee</b><br><br>Consider how you feel about winter and snow. Bowdoin winters are long, snowy and cold while Tufts, Amherst and Carleton will be about the same. Emory and Davidson have a much different climate.<br><br>", "<b>Username: barrons</b><br><br>Davidson has great and tough academics and nicer weather.

I\u2019ll follow up with those schools.<br>Emory gave me all merit aid. all other schools give all need aid.<br>I just checked the USNWR data for Davidson\u2019s retention rate and it said 95%.

I do know their CS / Eng is super strong, though, so I\u2019m sure I\u2019d fit in.<br>But I\u2019m not sure if 40k is worth it. The COA could go up for all I know so I\u2019d like to play conservative if possible<br><br>", "<b>Username: MA2012</b><br><br>If you got accepted at Emory I would choose that over Oxford campus unless you were drawn to the 2 year program and smaller campus for some reason. It is a larger research university compared to the rest of the schools on your list that are LACs. You can take some classes at Georgia Tech while at Emory.<br>Have you visited other schools on your list?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>Emory because it is all merit aid & you can take classes at Georgia Tech.<br><br>", "<b>Username: srlilly</b><br><br>@alooknac  Just curious about your source for Davidson\u2019s retention rate.

She and her friends, including some who majored in comp sci, got good jobs after graduation.  Minnesota\u2019s economy is good, and Carleton is close to the Twin Cities, where there are many job possibilities.  My daughter\u2019s financial aid decreased as our family income increased, but I expected that; we had high need and the school was very generous overall.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevestar888</b><br><br>@intparent<br>$250 refund! decent I think right!?<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>Sounds to me that Bowdoin was always your top choice and it came in at a do-able cost.

I sent an appeal to them but they said we need to see your parent\u2019s 2017 taxes\u2026<br>It might be because my parents have a business. colleges may interpret the income from that source in different ways.<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>This is a juicy choice. I think these are relative peers. Davidson\u2019s academics are not as well known as the other three, but somehow they hang around the top 10 of USNews, so they must be doing several things right.<br>Here are my impressions of each school. Some of this will be \u201cCaptain Obvious\u201d stuff, but even rhetorical info can help inform your idea of how well a school fits you:<br>Carleton<br><br>Lots of work.

The Oxford thing is not for everyone.  You go to a school for two years at a remote college 40 miles out and then move to the Emory College campus for your junior year.  If Emory College, that would be my choice and it\u2019s a very good experience going to school in a different region.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevestar888</b><br><br>@prezbucky<br>Nice summary!

Every school you list is fabulous, and you\u2019re lucky to have so many choices.  But Bowdoin is special in its alumni dedication.  It inspires tremendous giving (that\u2019s how I was able to go there\u2013my family was poor) and loyalty.  It has a terrific endowment.  I perceive (there is no doubt bias here) that the students are a tad more down-to-earth than at Amherst.  The food is amazing, and so are the dorms.  You can go abroad if things start feeling small.  You will be taught by full professors (as at several of your other choices). The weather is\u2026Maine.  You have to be able to like or ignore cold weather.  I don\u2019t love winter weather, but it\u2019s part of life in the Northeast.  The seacoast feeling is lovely, and Brunswick is a pretty and friendly town. Portland is close, Boston not too far.  I guarantee Minnesota is harsher, weather-wise.  I have visited Emory.  It is quite dissimilar than the LACs you mention.  It\u2019s a university, with all that affords\u2013more people, courses, bureaucracy, choices\u2026but I suspect if you do well at any of these schools, grad acceptances would be forthcoming.

In consideration of your biggest concern of need- and/or merit-based financial aids (FA) in attending college, you probably go to Emory due to the merit based money. Need based FA will be throughly reevaluated by college you attend every year.
