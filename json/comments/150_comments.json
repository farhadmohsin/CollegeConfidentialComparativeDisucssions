Physics gave birth to EE, and EE had to fight for it.  ME is responsible for a lot of the development in BM, but so are ChE, EE and the life sciences. As these field continue to develop, the interdisciplinary nature of BME becomes more complex and apparent. Sometimes the parents don\u2019t like to see the children leave home. They don\u2019t like the loss of control of their offspring and they don\u2019t like the competition for resources within the institution.

I\u2019m ex bain from JHU, and can tell you point blank all three \u201celite\u201d consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain, BCG) hire more than their fair share of JHU students.  I\u2019d also see what division of Goldman is hiring.  Hackathon usually constitutes their IT divisions - far from elite like their IB division which hires substantially from JHU (i\u2019m happy to name JHU alumni that are in Goldman\u2019s IB group from recent classes).<br>Lastly in tech, Google and Facebook and other elite firms also hire substantially from JHU.   I work for one of the former now.  It\u2019s unclear proportionally that they hire more from from Georgia Tech - I certainly don\u2019t see it at HQ.<br>I\u2019d choose JHU, bias and all.  When I graduated, I had my pick of grad schools with a full ride for Ph.D programs and my choice of jobs at graduation as well.  Ended up getting a Master\u2019s for free from MIT, but had McKinsey, Bain, and Google offers at graduation as well.  When I was choosing schools for undergrad, I was also offered a scholarship at Georgia Tech (Stamps) along with UMD (Banneker-Key) and UVa (Jefferson), but ended up paying a bit more at JHU and don\u2019t regret it in the least.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Greymeer</b><br><br>^<br>https://www.scribd.com/document/346963694/Hiringsolved-Ideal-Hire-Report-in-Tech<br>JHU not even on the list.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevensPR</b><br><br>@greymeer, I\u2019m talking about amongst the elite tech firms (Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Netflix, etc).  i can tell you Arizona State is not actively recruited at despite being top 10 on the list.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevensPR</b><br><br>@Greymeer and neither are Princeton or Caltech or Columbia which are powerhouses here in the valley so what does that say about your \u201clist\u201d exactly?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Greymeer</b><br><br>You work at 4 companies?<br>Also I wouldn\u2019t brag about elite consulting firms recruiting heavily at JHU.

Secondly, there\u2019s no way a Princeton or JHU grad would be less desirable than an ASU or NC State grad (vis a vis same grades - and not trying to be elitist here given quality of education).

GT used to have a much higher rate of acceptance than this and the school is still the same school just as many schools admit rates have decline substantially. Did these schools suddenly hire different professors and develop new curriculum?  No.  And by the way GT has always been a self selecting university as it is highly quantitative and rigorous.
