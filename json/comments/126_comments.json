{"title": "duke vs penn sneak in amherst", "comments": ["<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>I have the grateful opportunity to choose among these colleges as my place of study for the next four years. I\u2019ve looked at previous threads and they all say these two are so alike. They all are quite similar in what they present overall imo so I am quite torn by which one I should choose to attend. Some facts I am specifically looking for:<br><br>Strong economics (business track) and premed programs. I am currently applied as econ major at both Duke and Penn (Arts and Sciences), but there is still a very strong possibility I may look into premed / Biology as my future. The key is that I would like the option to switch between economics and premed should I need to do that. Overall seeking opinion on which departments are stronger of the two and provide better opportunity<br>Collaboration and faculty interaction. This is why I also brought up Amherst though its location does makes me slightly hesitate. I want to have good communication with my professors and know me relatively well. Duke has excellent FLUNCHes program that seems awesome, but both universities aren't humongous so I believe reaching faculty wouldn't be too difficult. Also, just want a quick two cents on how competitive both colleges are. I've heard high praise of collaborative work to nightmares like UC weed out classes cutthroatism..<br>Location does kinda matter. By campus Duke is far and away the best with the most pleasant weather but Durham seems much less exciting and engaging as a big city like Philly. I have visited both Duke and Penn on day trips, so I wanted an opinion of student life and if Philly has a massive advantage over Durham.<br><br>Also, please do NOT factor cost into this discussion, it will not affect my decision. I appreciate your comments.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>In terms of faculty scholarship, Penn places somewhat higher than Duke in economics: https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.usecondept.html.<br>Though not directly comparable to the above, this will give you a sense as to where Amherst places among its peers: https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.uslacecon.html.<br>Economics itself would be a perfectly suitable major for a pre-med student at any of your choices.<br><br>", "<b>Username: AlmostThere2018</b><br><br>Congrats on great options!<br>Duke is not known for being competitive \u2013 in fact they have grade inflation.

I think Cornell is the only Ivy that works students really hard\u2026<br>Duke has the nicer atmosphere and amenities \u2013 the campus is immaculate.  Durham is not large but it\u2019s a very hip and cool city with a strong night life, art scene, very progressive politics, etc.  It\u2019s the Brooklyn of the South, in my opinion \u2013 lots of hipsters and facial hair, lol!<br>Penn is more \u2018authentic,\u2019 urban and slightly gritty \u2013 though tbh I haven\u2019t been there in years.

Our pediatrician did this at Brown and DH\u2019s oncologist has an MBA, there are many links for a career in medicine.<br>Philly offers a lot of opportunities as an undergraduate: city opportunities affordable to students, good cheap eats at family owned restaurants, University City as a whole and Penn\u2019s campus. Penn students tend to work hard and then play hard within the academic club, sports club team, D1 team and Greek life social structures. Many many events are organized and scheduled. You will always have opportunities for fun and at the same time an understanding that research and academics come first. Exhausting, but a healthy way to explore, make wonderful life long connections and become an adult. Penn is referred to as the social Ivy for a reason. I would say that my children have a better experience in Philly (the gritt makes everything more affordable) than they would have had in Boston. Don\u2019t know the Durham area.<br>The STEM core classes are graded on a C curve especially SEAS and premed science classes. SEAS students say that premed CAS students tend to be more competitive for their A grades but that may be because engineering students learn early on that collaborating on problem sets and labs is the best way to learn their only survival path.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@AlmostThere2018 Thank you for your insight on both of these schools! To answer your question, I was still somewhat considering Amherst because of the opportunities with faculty I am able to engage in. I was just concerned that at these larger research universities that I would receive little to no interaction with my professors. Bottom line is I want to have strong letters of recommendation for Grad School, etc, and also just to have a stronger understanding of the material I am learning in class. Overall, it may come down to location. From your post it seems Durham is a little more lively than I thought, but I still feel like Philly would have more to offer. Overall it seems as if Penn is the better city but Duke offers the better college experience? Might have to flip a coin on this!<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@KLSD Thank you for your response! I just want to understand a little more about being a economics major and taking premed courses. Overall does that open the up the options to choose either a career in business or medicine later down the path, or is it mostly just \u201ceasier\u201d to complete premed requirements as a econ major as opposed to, say a Biology major? It is my wish to be able to explore in college a little, maybe the first (maybe second) year before committing to a track, so I just want to know by that premise if Duke or Penn jumps out more. Also, in terms of grit, would this be more of the overall student culture at Penn or is it the toughness that you need to obtain in order to be successful in Philly?

Yes, Philly has a higher crime rate, but Penn police dept is the second largest private police force and they do a terrific job of enforcing a wide area around University City.  There are multiple Philly public transportation options plus Uber.  I\u2019m not sure you can even compare a large northeast working class city to Durham.

If not, please do so.  I think that you will find far more \u201ccollaboration and faculty interaction\u201d at the undergraduate level at Amherst than at either of the large universities you are considering.  Also the town of Amherst, with UMass on one side and Amherst College on the other, has plenty student-oriented businesses and activities.  Nearby Northampton is another vibrant college town.<br>Amherst College offers both a strong economics major and excellent premed advising.  Since you are undecided about your major and your eventual career, you should keep your options open while exploring your interests.  As a first-year student you could start with an economics course and one or more of the recommended premed courses.  After a few semesters you will learn where your strengths and interests lie.  Then you can choose a major and decide whether to continue the premed courses.<br>Give Amherst some serious consideration.

And that lies the root to my reservations about choosing the college.

I just don\u2019t know if it is somewhat comparable to Durham in feel, though Durham is larger in size. Yes, this is precisely why I am still seriously considering Amherst in my options, due to the wide liberal arts education that sets up success in whichever field I choose.

All of you make valid points that makes it even harder to narrow down my choice haha  I think first order of business as pointed out by @AlmostThere2018 and @OHMomof2 is for me to either travel to Amherst Massachusetts asap or to take the college off the running. I\u2019ll try my best to do this in the next two weeks.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@JenniferClint I totally agree with your assessment. Just to know I would be matriculating into Penn Arts and Sciences, though I would be able to take some Wharton classes. I knew a good friend of mine whose sister transferred from A&S to Wharton, though I fathom it is quite difficult. Since you and @OHMomof2  seem to know Duke a little more, what do you both think about Duke\u2019s Focus and Engage programs and if they are valuable? I\u2019ve heard high praise for both.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@circuitrider In truth until I visit Amherst (in which it may sway my view) it would be a campus that has lots of activities and some social atmosphere/entertainment nearby. If I could go to a large for a weekend that would be great also. This puts a certain amount of flux into Durham in my mind. Charlotte is nearby (1.5 hours) but imo it doesn\u2019t offer the options like a Philly or Boston in Amherst\u2019s case. Admit days should clear more of this up.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@Penn95 Thank you for your insight! I was thinking quite closely along the lines as you mentioned. Philly just seems to have more to offer overall. For you, how is your experience at Penn and has it met/exceeded the expectations you looked for? I heard the social Ivy is magnificent but sometimes a little lacking in community culture and maybe too geared towards professional schooling and career outcomes.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@privatebanker I appreciate the advice. This past week has had me thankful of being able to have the opportunity to choose between these wonderful colleges and though I wished my instinct would choose one over the others, right now a three sided die would probably be the best solution <br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>@MrClutch007 I do have an undergraduate degree from Duke but I have also been a student at Penn and I am quite familiar with the school (I don\u2019t like to go into more detail for the sake of preserving my anonymity).<br>Penn may be marginally higher ranked in a plurality of fields but we should really focus on the fields you are interested in. According to US News, Penn is ranked 6 spots higher for Econ but Duke is ranked 13 spots higher for Biology. These are graduate rankings so take them with a pinch of salt but they speak to the strength of certain departments.<br>If you are desperate for Ivy cache, you should go to Penn. I would argue that the Ivy label is becoming less important as people are starting to recognize the value of individual institutions. There may have been a time when people would reflexively pick Dartmouth or Brown over a school like Chicago or Northwestern because of the Ivy cache. That is no longer the case.<br>Duke has a world-class medical school in Singapore and an up-and-coming liberal arts college in China. It is a school with global ambitions (Penn is too but Duke has always been less risk averse than its staid Ivy peers). This willingness to push the boundaries and try new things has always appealed to me.<br>Taking classes at Wharton is a nice touch and is something that should influence your decision. You will also be competing against Wharton students in the internship/job market. That is also something to consider.<br>Unfortunately, I did not take advantage of either of those programs. I do know several people who participated in Duke Engage. Most of them had very rewarding experiences in interesting parts of the world. The FOCUS program allows you to take a multidisciplinary approach to understanding a broad topic like \u201cGenetics and Genomics\u201d or \u201cGlobal Energy\u201d. If you are interested in any of the topics covered, it is probably a great way to learn more about the topic in question (in a small group setting). A program called Bass Connections allows multidisciplinary teams of students to work on real-world problems in a semi-structured setting. It is worth checking out. https://bassconnections.duke.edu<br>Finally, since Penn95 pitched Penn to you, let me end by listing a few reasons why I\u2019d lean towards Duke as a pre-frosh. 1). Smaller student body - more personal attention; 2). Greater undergraduate focus (think Yale vs Harvard); 3). More resources per capita - nicer facilities on average, etc.<br>I am partial to Penn and to Philadelphia. I definitely won\u2019t begrudge you for picking Penn. Having said that, you will have your entire life to experience a cool city but it\u2019s going to be hard to recreate the quintessential college experience after you graduate. Let your heart lead the way!<br><br>", "<b>Username: OHMomof2</b><br><br>You tagged me about Duke but I don\u2019t know anything about it other than a visit my own senior year (didn\u2019t apply).<br>As far as Amherst visits, there are two in April, one is a day and one is a weekend.

I went to grad school at Penn, so don\u2019t have the undergrad experience to compare.

I would say the central reason behind my tough decision between these two colleges is that they are so similar to each other overall. I don\u2019t think the Ivy prestige sways me at all now, and I agree in 2019 these strong non-Ivies are equal if not more prominent in career outcomes than those colleges. Both you and @havenoidea mentioned the advantage of being able to take Wharton classes but also having intense competition from them. I would agree, but in a sense I feel that recruiting will also trickle down to more opportunities in Penn CAS as a result of the talent in the ever-connected Wharton.

Btw even Chapel Hill is quite nice when I visited UNC. And that\u2019s fine with me  To your third point, I would say for Penn the college is basically integrated into Philly, so that bubble college life is going to feel drastically different from this standpoint.

For cost, there is basically no difference here among these colleges, although Amherst may have not fully understood my financial need. I think at this level of institutions we are talking about an Ivy or not won\u2019t make or break any career application, so that brand prestige alone is a non-factor imo.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@Fifty Thanks for the tip, I\u2019ll definitely do my best to check out Amherst! Yes, with these colleges I agree it\u2019s more on individual performance as opposed to what the institution offers for future success. I\u2019m just carefully evaluating where my next four years should be spent <br><br>", "<b>Username: austinmshauri</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>For cost, there is basically no difference here among these colleges, although Amherst may have not fully understood my financial need.<br>\"\"<br><br>Do any of these schools require parent loans?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>@MrClutch007 : Re: your post #38 above: While there is no wrong, poor or bad choice among your three options, I think that Duke University offers an experience that mixes the best of all three schools.<br>There will be plenty of time to enjoy big city life after your undergraduate years.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@austinmshauri All have unsubsidized Stafford loans.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@Publisher I agree with your point. It was probably one of the reasons I didn\u2019t apply to any schools in NYC since I knew that I was likely going to spend quite some time in the city when I graduate. Compromises are good!<br><br>", "<b>Username: HPTD12</b><br><br>Yes certainly around the immediate campus area at Penn I felt safe.<br>I do strongly encourage you to visit Amherst too.  It is very different and you may really like the vibe.   Even if you do not attend, years later you will be glad you made the journey.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>@HPTD12 Good point. Live a life with no regrets. Amherst will be on my priority list!<br><br>", "<b>Username: scalable</b><br><br>Tough choice, but go with fit! Opportunities from all three will be essentially the same, so the differentiator will be the environment. If you want a bigger city, think about Penn, although most graduates from Penn/Duke/Amherst go to the city anyways so you may enjoy this time in your life to enjoy something more serene and collegial. Duke and Amherst will be more collegial for sure, with the edge in terms of school spirit and campus energy and community going to Duke. In terms of student body size and subsequent undergrad attention, Penn is the largest with slightly less attention, followed by Duke, then Amherst with the smallest size and most attention. It looks like it depends what you want. Big city, more people in college years but sacrificing some intimate academics would be Penn. Small area, tight knit community and personalized experience would be Amherst. If you like aspects of both, probably Duke is the winning fit.<br><br>", "<b>Username: HPTD12</b><br><br>so @MrClutch007  what have you decided?<br><br>", "<b>Username: MrClutch007</b><br><br>Hello everyone and @HPTD12!! Sorry for the hiatus on replying, but it is only fair for me to tell everybody what I have decided after all the advice I have received. That being said, I\u2019m so thrilled to attend Duke next year! Overall, I judged size of school with location and ability to help reach the careers I want to pursue. Duke was a balanced blend of all of these factors, and the Research Triangle is among the fastest growing regions in the United States. With a favorable location and a medium sized undergrad enrollment, I feel that I will be able to access my professors without problem.<br>To all of you at CC, thank you so much for all of your help in this process. This community is often labeled by outsiders as \u201ctoxic\u201d, but I really feel that everyone is here to help each other navigate through one of the most trying, but also rewarding endeavors in life. I\u2019ll try to employ some of what I\u2019ve learned these past few years to help others, just like you all have helped me  Have a great summer y\u2019all!<br><br>", "<b>Username: AlmostThere2018</b><br><br>Appreciate you coming back to let us know your decision!<br>Congrats to you!  I predict you\u2019ll love it for all the reasons you mentioned, and Durham really is an awesome city. Have a great four years and do pay it forward.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Defensor</b><br><br>You made an excellent choice! Congratulations!<br><br>", "<b>Username: elena13</b><br><br>Congratulations and best of luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>Congratulations!
