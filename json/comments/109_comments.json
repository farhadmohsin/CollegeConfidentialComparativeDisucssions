I can also say that I know MAYBE 1 or 2 people from my graduating class at UIUC in the MechSE department that didn't have jobs.

You will always have a lot of local companies coming to recruit banking on the fact that a lot of people want to stay put. However, one of the key differences between a top tier school and lower tier school is that at the top schools, employers from all over also come to recruit, and lots of them!<br><br>For example, there are more new graduates hired from UIUC at Microsoft than any other single company, including places like U. Washington. That is because of the fact that UIUC has a very well known and renowned CS department. That means graduates are in demand even to companies outside of the Midwest. This is true of any school with a very well known department, and the more departments they have that produce in-demand graduates, the more likely it is that far away companies are going to come since they can come and recruit from multiple departments.<br><br>At a school like Illinois, where just about all of the engineering departments are very well known, there are tons of national and non-regional companies coming to recruit in addition to all the regional ones that every school gets.<br><br>I know tons of people, myself included, that had many job offers from companies on the East and West Coasts, for example.
