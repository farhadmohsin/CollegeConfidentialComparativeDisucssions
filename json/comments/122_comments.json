Carleton was by far the weakest college on her final list in CS.

She got exactly the job she hoped she would coming out of college.  Carleton in fact did not have the faculty to meet her needs fully, but what it did was to fund her to do summer research with CS faculty at a major university elsewhere.

Carleton, Swarthmore, and Vassar are all basically seen as peers here.  Swarthmore is the snootiest of them, and the most high-pressure, but Carleton is also seen as a very high-quality academic environment, and Vassar, too.  Oberlin is also very popular, and well-respected, but somewhat less intense than the other three (not necessarily a bad thing).  I probably know more people, ages 30-65, who went to Oberlin than people who went to Swarthmore, notwithstanding that Swarthmore is a 20-minute commuter train ride away, and Oberlin is about 600 miles away.
