As many on here have already said, the rankings aren\u2019t necessarily all they are cracked up to be, but if you look at the US News & World Report rankings for best undergrad aerospace engineering programs, MIT is unsurprisingly at the top.  However, #2 on the list is Michigan (tied with Georgia Tech, another public university).  These are both ranked higher than even Stanford and Cal Tech which come in at 4 and 5.  Michigan is certainly no slouch in engineering, that\u2019s for sure.  So, does it make sense to pay $150K (or more based on one\u2019s income) just to go to the #1 university over the #2?  I can\u2019t see it.

It\u2019s my understanding that with MIT you can get credit for certain AP classes as well, but that it doesn\u2019t mean you can graduate earlier, it just frees up another slot for you to take an elective.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 1NJParent</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>If the equity compensation was in stock options, then they should have a strike price the same as the market value as of the grant date.
