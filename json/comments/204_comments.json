BM\u2019s campus is lovely. I think it\u2019s one of the prettiest in the country and the dorms are great.

My ability to provide concrete advice is limited by my lack of/tangential knowledge as to several of the colleges she is considering. But for what it\u2019s worth\u2026<br>Our daughter is a freshman at Carleton, intending to major in Bio with plans of attending medical school. Like you, Carleton gives us a small amount of need-based aid. Although she never looked into Bryn Mawr (we did circle the campus by car!), she did apply to Haverford last year. We also had looked at one women\u2019s-only college \u2013 Mount Holyoke, where we toured, stayed in their guesthouse and where she interviewed and attended a class. But she quickly dismissed the idea of a women\u2019s-only college as she just did not see the point of attending one.<br>Bryn Mawr to my mind is less of a women\u2019s-only college due to its close interplay with Haverford. A colleague of mine who graduated from Bryn Mawr (Classics/Greek) about 10 years ago commented to me that Mount Holyoke would be a stronger science choice for our daughter than Bryn Mawr. Yet Haverford is only a mile away.<br>All of our daughter\u2019s applications were filed regular-decision, as we wanted the ability to evaluate our ultimate costs for each. Although she received $24,000 of wonderful merit aid to attend one LAC strong in sciences, Carleton clearly become her first-choice college as we progressed. She is challenged, happy and doing well at Carleton \u2013 and we are managing it financially\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: nostalgicwisdom</b><br><br>I can speak a little about Scripps and the other Claremonts. The Claremont system is incredible- really easy to cross-register in, rich social life, 7 dining halls, and all the employment opportunities hosted by one school are open by all schools. So you get a LAC experience, but with the resources seen at a larger university. Being a Claremont student means you get access to the alumni networks of all the 5 Colleges. It\u2019s a much more intimate system than the one Smith is in. Carleton and Pomona are very similar to each other, so if she desires a more intellectual student body, she can make friends at Pomona easily or take their classes. Not to say Scripps students aren\u2019t very bright and motivated themselves.<br>There are a few medical center nearby, and a lot within an hour to an hour and a half drive of Scripps. A lot of students intern at the nearby Pomona Valley Hospital, while some go further to USC Medical Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and UCLA. Having a car, or finding a carpool buddy, is critical, because while public transportation exists, it takes a really long time. Here\u2019s a full listing of places she could work at: https://www.kecksci.claremont.edu/prehealth/Volunteer/Premed.asp<br>Keck\u2019s acceptance rate to medical schools is very high- nearly twice the national average. I think all of these schools will report similar pre-med statistics. So premed outcomes aren\u2019t something you should worry about. One big problem is that Keck is oversaturated with majors, and a number of students have been locked out from taking some courses simply because there isn\u2019t enough room. You may want to get a Keck Sci student perspective on this. I haven\u2019t heard of this happening at other LACs. Research opportunities are definitely there- I worked at Pomona over the summer and the 5C\u2019s host summer research get-togethers, and there are a lot of kids from Keck in the summer. One really nice thing is the HHMI program, which will enable her to do research at Harvey Mudd or Pomona too if she so desires. You\u2019re getting research offerings not from just Keck, but also Mudd and Pomona.<br>The smog issue is overblown, especially in the colleges themselves. SoCal has taken efforts seriously to combat smog in the last few years, and the air quality is much better than before, though it is worse than the US average. I went to Pomona a few years ago, and had friends coming from Vermont, Maine, and New Hampshire, and they never complained about the air quality. I actually can\u2019t think of a single day in my four years where the smog was getting in the way, though there are a couple of days when you can see it hanging near the mountains. I\u2019m not from California.  The bigger natural threat is earthquakes- California is due for a major earthquake within the next 30 years, and the Claremont Colleges are right on a fault line, though there is a great earthquake preparedness system across the colleges.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Snowball_City</b><br><br>Smith is walking distance to a hospital.

You know, I had no idea private colleges gave out merit-based scholarships anymore! I was sure private school was a lost cause since we are at that cursed, upper middle class threshold. Income and assets (= Bay Area home) too high for meaningful need-based aid, but too low to afford that kind of tuition without major loans. Pretty awesome. Now, it may be a reality. I think my D would thrive at a small LAC in a way that might be difficult at a UC Berkeley or UCLA.<br>Any thoughts on Oberlin along the same lines?<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@nostalgicwisdom - I just saw one of your comments on another thread about CMC in which you say that Keck is where people go to take \u201ceasy\u201d science classes. I can believe that Mudd and Pomona have more challenging science classes given their selectivity, but is Keck really that weak in the sciences?<br><br>", "<b>Username: nostalgicwisdom</b><br><br>No, Keck is not weak in the sciences at all, and AISS- the combined bio/chem/physics class at Keck- may be one of the most challenging curriculums available at the 5C\u2019s. The thing I\u2019ve heard is people taking intro pre-med physics at Keck because it is better taught there than Pomona and less rigorous than Mudd (nearly everything is less rigorous than Mudd, though). It was wrong of me to generalize to all of their classes, and I regret my lack of maturity in the past (I think the comment was three years old, for reference, right when I was a young student at Pomona)<br>One thing I\u2019d want to look into is how overcrowded Keck is. I\u2019ve heard of students getting locked out of required courses because there is so much demand. The STEM majors at all 3 schools are growing and because that home for science isn\u2019t growing any larger (whereas Mudd/Pomona have built new facilities), it\u2019s getting quite constrained. A current science major at Scripps would be able to answer this for you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@nostalgicwisdom - Thank you for that clarification. That\u2019s helpful. Wife and D are visiting Scripps next week for the admitted students day, so D will look into the over-enrollment issue you raise. I\u2019m also curious to find out how they prioritize registration each semester. Still trying to figure out which will be better for science, Scripps/Keck or Bryn Mawr/ Haverford (she got into both Bi-Cos, but given the merit scholarship, Bryn Mawr is looking more realistic, even though she really liked Haverford). She\u2019ll visit Bryn Mawr & Haverford in a couple of weeks.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WISdad23</b><br><br>We visited the eastern women\u2019s colleges on your list and Whitman. I am a psychiatrist too, FWIW. I would vote Bryn Mawr. It is a gorgeous campus, STEM strong, they have one of those 5th year pre-med booster years (forget what that is called), part of the consortium, and access to Philadelphia (which has several media schools). Haverford is also excellent.<br>Whitman is a very nice school but quite a bit different than Bryn Mawr. My only knock on Whitman is its remote location and the transit time to visit.

After $$, the key is really how your daughters respond to the environment. The thing about LACs is that they can be very alike on paper- and have a completely different feel.  Consortium or no, you live, eat, sleep and breathe on your home campus- and it is amazing how differently different kids react. I know (and also have) kids who have known within minutes of getting out of the car that it was not the place for them. Equally, I knew before one of my collegekids which college she would pick before she did- b/c I saw how she responded to the place.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>Is there any grade deflation going on at Bryn Mawr? I heard rumors. Because my D is thinking about being a pre-med, this is critical to know. It\u2019s one of the main reasons she is leaning away from UC Berkeley and UCLA.

Don\u2019t expect them to hand out 4.0s like candy, though.<br>For pre-med, I would suggest having the prospective student reach out to the pre-med advising office to get answers to your questions from the source.

I disagree with the philosophy that having students compete for a limited number of high grades on a curve is \u201cmotivational\u201d in any positive or healthy way. In fact, this grade scarcity creates an atmosphere that is downright toxic. Why should one student\u2019s success mean another\u2019s failure? That\u2019s my point. Now, the problem is, how to deal with comparisons between professors and consistency year over year when you have criterion-reference grading. I think even when you grade on a curve, pre-determining the grade distribution is not the best way to go. Too often, that is what instructors do.<br>I\u2019m hoping that given Bryn Mawr\u2019s honor code philosophy of not discussing grades and rankings among students, the college discourages professors from pitting students against each other in their grading policies. Anyway, thought someone might have firsthand knowledge and comment.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Springbird</b><br><br>@BobShaw<br>My daughter toured Smith, Wellesley, & Bryn Mawr several times each and was accepted to all of them (currently a Smithie), but Wellesley is the only place where grade deflation came up among the three.<br>Also, found this article in a Bryn Mawr/Haverford publication which doesn\u2019t reference grade deflation in the traditional sense, but rather mentions frustration with the wide gap between a 3.3 and 3.7 on the 4.0 grading scale:  https://ehgazette.blogs.brynmawr.edu/2016/01/31/grading-our-grading-system/<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@Springbird - Thank you for that information. That sounds like a general issue with distinguishing plus and minus grades on the grading scale. However, this reminds me of another matter: tell me if I\u2019m wrong, but there should be no difference between a 12-point grading scale and a 4-point grading scale, correct? (Assuming plus and minus grades are treated the same way in both cases.) The Claremont colleges and Carleton use a 12-point scale whereas the Bi-Co schools use a 4-point scale. Using 12 points simply allows you to assign a whole number to each letter +/- grade. For example, 10.0 for a B+ rather than 3.3. Am I missing something?<br><br>", "<b>Username: MinnesotaDadof3</b><br><br>@BobShaw: Just to add my 2 cents \u2013 I do like the numerical GPA grade distinctions inherent in Carleton College\u2019s grading system (where our daughter is a freshman).  For example, while a \u2018B\u2019 represents a numerical grade of 3.0, Carleton assigns a 3.33 to a \u2018B+\u2019 and a 2.67 to a \u2018B-\u2019.  This seems fair, as there is as much of a difference in academic performance between a 'B-\" and a \u2018B+\u2019 as there is between a \u2018B\u2019 and an \u2018A-\u2019. Yet some other grading system might well assign a 4.0 to an \u2018A-\u2019 while giving a 3.0 to a \u2018B+\u2019, thus falsely creating a large numerical gulf in GPA between those two rather small differences in academic performance.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Springbird</b><br><br>Wow!  I wasn\u2019t aware that there were such a variety of grading systems!  That sounds like it could be an entirely new topic on its own.  <br>@BobShaw I got the sense that Bryn Mawr students work hard for their grades.  Not in the same sense as grade deflation like at Wellesley, but rather that Bryn Mawr classes are challenging and require a lot of effort.  That blog I cited above makes no mention of the traditional sense of grade deflation there, indicating that that is not a practice at Bryn Mawr.<br>Their post-bac program would seem to indicate that the school has a lot of experience with med school apps.  Is your daughter self-motivated?  Does she enjoy spending time doing problem sets and labs?  Is she one to go to professor office hours and chat with profs after class?  Will she reach out for help if she needs it?  If so, she will likely do very well in terms of GPA with all of the supports that a school like Bryn Mawr offers.<br>I second @doschicos that the feel for the school will likely be important.  If your daughter is happy at her school, she is more likely to do well.  What is she telling you?<br>@mom2collegekids is an expert on pre-med (her S went to Alabama on scholarship and then med school).

Very \u201cprogressive\u201d (i.e. liberal), which is somewhat interesting given that it\u2019s in Ohio. The college also has a famous music conservatory, which means there is a great cross-section of students. The drawback in my opinion is that it is relatively isolated. This contrasts with Smith. It\u2019s a women\u2019s college but part of the 5-college consortium, of which Amherst has a stellar reputation.I found Smith\u2019s campus to be beautiful and everyone there to be very helpful.

Carleton\u2019s NPC just came down to within a couple of thousand of the merit schools. Haverford (which also gave my D a late Magill-Rhoads Scholar designation) isn\u2019t quite as good, although it is substantially better than the initial award. In any case, this suddenly makes my D\u2019s #1 Dream School, Carleton, closer to reality.

However, she didn\u2019t like Haverford as much this time around, compared to the first visit (when she interviewed and toured). I hate to criticize Haverford since it is a good college, and it may be a good fit for many students. But it\u2019s important to share different perspectives on this forum for other parents and students to read. My D had some reservations about the social vibe at Haverford, which is surely a factor of the Fords she was grouped with. It just didn\u2019t click for her. Also, while Haverford looks diverse on paper, it didn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d diverse to her, if that makes any sense. There were quite a few African Americans, but they didn\u2019t seem to be mixing as much with the White and Asian students in the dining hall or walking around campus. She also heard from students that cliques form around \u201cCustoms\u201d groups, and this can be good or bad depending on the individual who is put into such a group. You either feel like you belong or you don\u2019t, and if you don\u2019t (which happens to a lot of URMs, apparently), you will have a more difficult time making friends at the beginning of your first year. She had expected Haverford to be more inclusive. On the other hand, the faculty she met at the \u201cacademic fair\u201d, especially in the Haverford Biology department (including the chair), were great. The Career and Professional Development advisors were also great. If she goes to Bryn Mawr, she will take classes at Haverford for sure (like everyone else). Less important: Fords (and Mawrtyrs) said that Bryn Mawr has the better food and dorms.<br>The Fords my D liked, she liked a lot. She met a few helpful Haverford students in Bryn Mawr classes who had nice things to say about Bryn Mawr as a college and Mawrtyrs as students. And there are students at Haverford who have an incredible amount of respect for Mawrtyrs, saying that they are some of the most intelligent and independent-minded women they know. These Fords also happened to be very helpful, kind, and friendly. They were honest about what is good and bad at Haverford. My D can see herself developing strong friendships with these students. These were the kind of people who attracted my D to Haverford in the first place. I also met and chatted with very intelligent and respectful Haverford students. It looked like students, in general, are serious about their studies.<br>Unfortunately, my D also met Fords \u2013 almost exclusively women \u2013 who badmouthed Mawrtyrs at every turn. They were obsessed with trying to prove how Haverford is Swarthmore\u2019s equal and Bryn Mawr\u2019s superior because of acceptance rates. They said things that hinted at jealousy of Mawrtyrs as \u201ccompetition\u201d for men at parties. This same group of women also happened to be trying to make out with men\u2019s track and field athletes left and right. This group turned off my D in a major way. In contrast, at BMC, the only criticism she heard from any Mawrtyr about Haverford is that they didn\u2019t feel Haverford is as inclusive or as diverse as BMC is nowadays. Any other prevailing attitudes about Haverford were well-hidden. Maybe Mawrtyrs are more careful about publicly criticizing their brethren down Lancaster Ave, or the amount of alcohol in your system makes a difference. Most Mawrtyrs she met didn\u2019t seem to give a hoot about rankings and such, but they were extremely proud of their intellectual environment and quality of education, and the strong bonds they shared with the other Seven Sisters alumnae. My interpretation: Bryn Mawr doesn\u2019t seem to have any insecurity about its standing as an institution. They are proud of their history and their mission as a women\u2019s college, and they don\u2019t care so much about comparisons to their Tri-Co partners.<br>Another contrast: the hosts at Bryn Mawr were strict about making sure visiting students didn\u2019t linger outside the dorms too late. Even first year students acted like parents when it came to making sure the visitors were safe and stayed out of trouble. At Haverford, my D and others were taken to parties where students were getting hammered. Apparently, alcohol is huge on campus, and some interpret the honor code to mean they can do whatever they want (according to current students, mind you \u2013 I am not telling you my opinion, only what others said to my D). A byproduct of not having RAs (honor code): several women my D met had moved their beds out of their own rooms and into their boyfriends\u2019 rooms, where they slept every night. And they bragged about their nightly \u201cexploits\u201d. This actually shocked me; I had never heard of moving beds around. Maybe it happens at other colleges, I don\u2019t know. They\u2019re consenting adults, so who am I to judge? But not my D\u2019s cup of tea and totally unexpected.<br>The one thing Mawrtyrs did complain about: Bryn Mawr can sometimes feel too quiet and lonely. Not as much going on with respect to typical college social activities as they have at Haverford, according to Mawrtyrs my D spoke with. I\u2019m sure if the program had happened on a Friday or Saturday, there would have been more social events planned. We saw this at Scripps too. Seems like at women\u2019s colleges, at least those that are in close proximity to co-ed colleges, the women go off-campus to party while protecting the tranquility of their own territory. Not a bad thing for me, as a dad, I will admit. I want my D to have an environment where she can study for four years without too many distractions. For her, this was a mixed bag, although she doesn\u2019t drink.<br>I found it interesting that Haverford chose to have their event on a Sunday, when there were no classes going on. All the planned events promoted school spirit. They were putting temporary tattoos of black squirrels on everyone. (Was funny to walk into Bryn Mawr with those tattoos on.) Class visits were not \u201cofficially\u201d part of the Haverford program. This was a big contrast to Bryn Mawr\u2019s Monday program, where students were assigned two classes according to their expressed interests on the registration form. Haverford seemed to emphasize the social aspects of college life while Bryn Mawr emphasized education and informal social bonding. BMC\u2019s structure also allowed my D to bond more with her admitted class, resulting in new friendships. At Haverford, her interactions were primarily with existing students (which is not a bad thing, just a different experience).<br>At the end of the day, my D had to go with her gut feeling, and based on this, Haverford was crossed out from the list.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>Her experiences at Haverford don\u2019t echo what I know about the school, but glad she got familiar with the campus as she\u2019ll spend at least part of her time there as a Bryn Mawr student, which is what I was trying to glean. Glad your daughter found her fit at Bryn Mawr. It\u2019s a great school! Plus the merit scholarship will save you a ton anyway, so count your blessings and your dollars that she didn\u2019t prefer Haverford.  With her interests in music, CS, and the sciences, she\u2019ll likely wind up taking advantage of Haverford\u2019s offerings while availing herself of all the benefits of Bryn Mawr.<br>Although your daughter doesn\u2019t drink alcohol now (given her age) don\u2019t be surprised if that might change or even overnighting in a guy\u2019s room or visa versa. Kids change a lot in their college years and such behavior isn\u2019t unusual at any colleges (absent BYU and a few others), even women\u2019s colleges. Went on back in my day, too. <br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@WISdad23 - Good advice, but did you drop a 1 by mistake? She\u2019s going in with the assumption that it goes down to -17 deg F! Nothing a heavy coat, thermals, gloves, and a hat can\u2019t solve. I explained to her why I like saying a poorly designed website is \u201cslower than sap on a cold Wisconsin morning,\u201d and that MN may actually be colder. She doesn\u2019t mind the cold, likes rain, and loves snow. As a figure skater, she is excited about the tradition of turning the Bald Spot into a rink in the winter. You can\u2019t do that in CA! And while Boston isn\u2019t as cold, she trudged through the streets for an entire day in temperatures approaching 0 deg F one rare winter day. Right now, it\u2019s going into the thirties at night, in Northfield. Last time we visited, it was only November and fairly chilly.  What is nice about Northfield is that it gets more sunny days than New England.<br>I think it\u2019s important for her to experience something different during college. A small town in the frigid, rural Midwest is as different as it gets. But as she wrote in her essay for Carleton, the warmth of the people she met more than compensated for the cold weather. Besides, there must be a good reason why 9-10% of the student body (second largest group by state) choose to put up with the climate when they could have easily stayed in California. <br>Let\u2019s see how the final visit to Carleton goes this week. Moment of truth.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>@doschicos - Yeah, it\u2019s just one person\u2019s perspective and experience. Hard to generalize. As for extracurricular activities, well, we\u2019ve done our best to raise her well. Now she\u2019s on her own to lead her life as she pleases. Parenting!<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>I\u2019m sure most Haverford kids are confident and self-assured, but there might be a reason for the defensiveness and insecurity of the kids who were so concerned about being Swat\u2019s \u201cequal\u201d: apparently Swat kids have been known to refer to Haverford as their \u201csafety school\u201d. Now obviously that is ridiculous, as no school with Haverford\u2019s admissions stats can ever be considered a safety, for anyone, but still\u2026 I can see how this teasing could grate one\u2019s nerves and stir the cauldron of competition, insecurity and jealousy.<br>I think Haverford is awesome academically, myself.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>As a parent of a former Tri-Co student whose kid and friends of kid could care less about whether a fellow classmate was a Swattie, a Ford, or a Mawter, I think for many (most!) it is a nonissue. I just want to give a different perspective because I have never sensed any real rivalry or animosity amongst the different colleges, quite the opposite really. My kid had friends from different campuses, teammates, classmates, participated in shared ECs. I never heard any stereotyping or comments at all. Students were judged on what kind of people they were not what campus they resided on. I really don\u2019t think it is an issue on any campuses more luck of the draw on who one might have met at an accepted student event. Given the overlap of majors and with many different clubs and such, students attending different cultural events on different campuses, it has always appeared to me to be quite a collaborative relationship.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>Well, D got back from Carleton, and after spending a day trying to justify why NOT to go to Carleton (mainly the food), she chose Carleton. Was even better the second time around. No fanfare, just an ordinary day, but she was able to visit several classes, meet multiple professors, socialize with MANY students (some of whom took her to coffee or lunch), and meet with the pre-health advisor (who herself went to Smith and told her how great Bryn Mawr is, assuring her she would not make a wrong decision either way). She also met a parent who has one kid at Carleton and one at Bryn Mawr (and loved both). In the end, it boiled down to Midwestern charm. My wife, who wanted our D to stay close to home, thought the people they met at Carleton and in Northfield were the nicest people they had met at any college. A stroll through \u201cThe Arb\u201d closed the deal. It also helps that we discovered a strong connection to the local alumni network through a friend. I think my D is going to start a campaign to fix the Asian cuisine at Carleton. Seriously, how hard is it to make teriyaki beef?  We need to supply some good recipes for Indian, Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese food to the dining services (Bon Appetit?).<br>Carleton was the last college she visited before applying, became her first choice at some point, and was the last college she visited before making a final decision. Like a good marriage, sometimes, when you know, you just know, and dating only confirms you were right the first time. Thank you, all, for all the valuable advice. I am so happy this is over.<br><br>", "<b>Username: collegemom3717</b><br><br>Well done to all of you, @BobShaw! once you come out the other side the path often seems so clear, but I think that there is a merit to the struggle to get there- I think they learn a lot about themselves as well as about trade-offs and the general complexity many adult decisions. Hope she has a wonderful adventure at Carleton!<br><br>", "<b>Username: BobShaw</b><br><br>Thanks, @collegemom3717 . Very true.<br><br>"]}
