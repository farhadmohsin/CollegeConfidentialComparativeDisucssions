Students can take almost unlimited classes as satisfactory/no credit . The deadline to drop a class is at the last day of classes. Also with no distribution requirements, students are largely taking classes they are excited to be in, rather than to fulfill requirements.<br>Brown only gives grades of A, B and C with no A- or B+, etc. so if a student doesn\u2019t get a 4.0 in the class, the next possible grade is a 3.0. So some students who are not getting As and in some cases, even Bs, will drop a class at the end of the semester rather than taking a grade that will substantially lower their GPA. Brown also does not give Ds and Fs. Any grade lower than a C and it\u2019s as if the class never existed on your transcript.<br>The A-B-C grade system also sometimes result in the cutoff for an A being a little more generous than at a school where the next lowest grade is a 3.7 rather than a 3.0. but, there is a degree of grade deflation as well when the student with a 3.6-3.7 average in the class gets a B/3.0 as a final grade.<br>GPA inflation is not the same thing as grade inflation in individual classes.  The quality and quantity of work that is required to get an A in a class at Brown is not at some lower level than its peer schools. Like many peer schools,   most classes  at Brown don\u2019t have a bell curve distribution for assigning grades, so if 60% of the students do A level work then 60% of the students will get As.
