I was just wondering what people's thoughts are when comparing the two. I'm currently undecided and not leaning towards any specific field or major (unhelpful, I know). I like that they both offer a strong liberal arts education, and I could see myself attending either of them<br><br>", "<b>Username: moooop</b><br><br>Boston &amp; DC are both fascinating cities, but they have little in common.

Unless BC is significantly cheaper, it should be a very easy decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ab2002</b><br><br>@hzhao2004 I completely agree. Georgetown is absolutely amazing.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ccfk1221</b><br><br>gtown!<br><br>", "<b>Username: 3sonsmom</b><br><br>I'll send some love for BC! We went to Accepted Student Day yesterday, twins have it in their top two. We've never been to Georgetown honestly. Both in top three Catholic colleges.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lrose00</b><br><br>@MYOS1634 currently waiting on my aid to be processed by gtown, hopefully they do it soon! Also waiting on an appeal from BC because their aid was not great. Right now I wanted peoples opinions regardless of COA.<br><br>@hzhao2004 @ab2002 @ccfk1221 thanks for the feedback! Can you give any specific reasons why you would pick Georgetown over BC? BC has been my first choice for over a year probably. I wasnt expecting to be accepted by Georgetown so I havent really considered it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>BC factors real estate assets very heavily - basically they expect you use HELOC for your college costs.<br>Georgetown is generally considered the most prestigious among both and among the \"Ivy+\" colleges (similar to Ivies although not in the athletic league, like Northwestern, UChicago..)<br><br>", "<b>Username: ab2002</b><br><br>@lrose00 Well, it's in Washington D.C. for one. Washington is pretty hard to beat. There's so much history, and there is tons of stuff to do. At BC, you're pretty far away from downtown, so you won't have a ton of opportunities to go downtown. It's about two hours from Boston. Georgetown is literally eight minutes from the White House. Personally, I believe that the education at Georgetown will exceed BC. This may be biased, because I absolutely LOVE Georgetown and its vibe.<br><br>", "<b>Username: evergreen5</b><br><br>\"\"At BC, you're pretty far away from downtown, so you won't have a ton of opportunities to go downtown.

Great school but Ivy plus is Stamford, U Chicago, MIT, and Duke. All 8% acceptance rates or lower.<br><br>Please stay factual.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lrose00</b><br><br>@ab2002 BC isnt that far from Boston, but its true that Georgetown is closer to Washington. I love Washington and Boston, so that isnt really helpful either lol. I do love the historic aspect of both cities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lrose00</b><br><br>@MYOS1634 would you say that Georgetown also heavily factors in real estate?

Most of this thread is fake news except for warblersrule's post #15.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@wisteria100<br><br>Great choices. Congratulations. We have the same choices but admitted students day(s) pushed it clearly to Boston College. Facilities. The vibe of the kids and smiles. Commitment to core and core renewal was excellent. My D is a premed and total STEM focus. Having a commitment to liberal arts for all as part of the educational process is important to her. No wrong choices here for you. USNWR has Gtown at 20 and BC 30. Forbes and elsewhere are similar. BCs business school is even better. PreMed counseling center is better at BC in our opinion as well. Know folks who went through both.

We split with one son each and also attended freshman experience, psychology, residential life and I went with science son to the chemistry section, Entertaining, knowledgeable professor and a current senior highlighted the support for medical school application process. The hike to the dorm tour was a challenge but the students handled it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tR5674</b><br><br>Half of BC's campus is within city limits. Half hour to downtown on trolley. 15 minute walk to Cleveland Circle.<br><br>Georgetown is a 5 minute walk to great stuff but a half hour subway to the mall. Anyone saying that DC has more opportunities than Boston is confused.<br><br>No bad choice here.<br><br>", "<b>Username: wisteria100</b><br><br>I asked my D this question as we visited both recently and she likes both. She picked Gtown, but said BC felt like it had stronger community aspects. Since BC is getting not a lot of love on this thread, Ill agree with @privatebanker that faculties and campus at BC is better and it seems friendlier and less stressful.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mastadon</b><br><br>In terms of financial opportunities.<br><br>Boston is a top ten global financial center, DC is top 50.<br>Both have access to NYC.<br><br><url>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Financial_Centres_Index</url><br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>The dorm was a hike.

Good luck at Georgetown @wisteria100. Shell love it!<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@3sonsmom Yes we were in the SRO core lecture. Thought the two profs from different disciplines co-teaching the class was very novel. Also the small class staying together for two semesters with reflections discussion at night over dinner was interesting too. What did you think?<br><br>", "<b>Username: par72</b><br><br>Agree with other posters that Georgetown has the stronger academic reputation and better alumni network.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 3sonsmom</b><br><br>@privatebanker We were impressed with so many choices in the core classes. I want one of them to take \"your brain on theatre\" (I believe that was it). Two unrelated courses with the professors and the discussions, team building, our group liked the idea.

It just said \"Georgetown Scholarship\" for part of the award. If you have not already contacted your individual financial aid POC, I would do so now to make sure that your package is in process. The financial aid POC was great, and told us when a decision has been made and when to expect it. There are listings by last name on the web site. My son is currently weighing Georgetown SFS and UVA. Will be headed to GAAP on 4/20. Decisions, decisions. Good luck.<br><br>", "<b>Username: irishfan21</b><br><br>Boston College... I visited both but ended up only applying to BC out of those too, I loved the vibe there and didn't; quite feel it at Georgetown.

They gave me 21k. It would be possible for me to go there if they gave me 10 or 15k more, if I took out a little bit in loans. Does anyone think going to the financial aid office in person and asking for more money would be successful?<br><br>My family has a unique financial situation and I explained that to my advisor in our emails but she didn't seem sympathetic.

Also worth mentioning ..<br><br>Is going in person more successful when asking for more money?<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>No, but you can go if you wish - you need to highlight information that wasn't provided or that wasn't clear.

Im not sure if that counts<br><br>", "<b>Username: VAMom23</b><br><br>I have been discussing FA with Georgetown over the last few weeks. Siblings only count to reduce the EFC at Georgetown if they are enrolled in an undergrad program. Feel free to go in person, but I don't get the idea that there is a lot of flexibility from the FA office. They have been responsive, but not budging. They advised us that they do not consider scholarships awarded from other universities. We received a good package, but year 4 is making it look impossible because my EFC will go up 40% (GU explained that they split the EFC between two kids as 60/40)<br><br>"]}
