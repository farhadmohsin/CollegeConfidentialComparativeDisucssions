He will have to pay full price for Yale(60k) and in-state for Michigan(~15k, he received some scholarship dont know the name) which if attends Yale will leave him with a extremely large student loan. He will most likely do something business related so it makes the decision ever harden considering how good Michigan's business school is.

If he's going to be stuck with 150k in loans, that will probably compound to closer to 200k-250k by the time it is repaid.

That is a lot of money. The OP clearly stated that his friend will have to take a significant student loan, so money is a concern. This is not a straightforward decision. Yes, Yale (which is on par with Harvard, MIT, Princeton and Stanford) is a better overall university than Michigan, but no way is it $180k better if much of that money will manifest itself in the form of debt. The alternative in this case is Michigan (which is on par with Cornell, Northwestern, Penn and UVa) not some second rate university. Choosing Yale would not be unwise, but it is not obvious either. This is a very personal decision, and there is no right or wrong. It really depends on one's priorities. Financially, Michigan is the more rational choice. Going to Yale will most likely not make up for the $180k spent on tuition rather than being invested soundly from day 1. But there is something to be say about having gone to Yale for college. It is indeed a special experience.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CHD2013</b><br><br>Good points bluebound. There's clearly a lot to consider with strong arguments on both sides. Posters taking extreme positions should back them up in a better way than we've seen above. For example:<br><br>Alexandre - you say \"but no way is it $180k better\" and then later in you post say going to Yale would not be unwise and that it is a persona decision. After starting by admitting it is not a straightforward decision you contradict yourself with strong statements and then a balanced evaluation of the other side of the argument.<br><br>rjkofnovi makes stronger statements with no balance. Frankly, the statement is flat out wrong. You've made the point that the decision is completely clear. I can assure you that many people that went to Yale and had career earnings of many millions of dollars realize they may not have had that type of opportunity if they had gone to Michigan. For example, if you look at the educational background of senior partners at many private equity shops you'll see a very limited number of schools represented. Coming from UM would significantly reduce your job prospects at these firms where the average senior employee an make north of $5 million per year. In that context, $180k in student loans would b e considered a very wise investment.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\"Nobody gunning for Yale goes to Michigan.\"<br><br>Nobody? So certain are we? 25% of Michigan's incoming class had a perfect 4.0 unweighed GPA, was ranked in the top 5% of their high school class and most of those students scored 1500+/33+ on the SAT/ACT, and yet not one of those 1,500 incoming Freshmen was \"gunning\" for Yale? That's a remarkably astute observation. I suppose those gunning for Yale do not apply to any target schools...either that or Yale must really suck for those 1,500 freshmen not to have even considered applying.<br><br>For a sense of perspective, Yale is generally rated anywhere from 1-5 while Michigan is generally rated anywhere from 6-20. Woefully flawed ranking methodologies and unethical data reporting practices may cloud the issue and severely distort some rankings, but most people involved in graduate school admissions or corporate recruiting aren't fooled.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Pat1120</b><br><br>\"Lifetime earnings of avg Yale grad isn't $180k more than avg Michigan grad?

The average Michigan grad is slightly less intelligent, and much less interested in prestige and income. If your friend got into Yale, he is likely in the top 20% of students at Mich.

On USNWR it's #28, Forbes ranks it #30, Business Insider rates it #20.<br><br>Actually,that is not accurate. If anything, most undergraduate rankings have Michigan ranked among the top 20, including Forbes. Forbes ranks Michigan #30 overall, but that includes LACs. Among research universities (and I was only talking about research universities when I said Michigan would be rated among the top 20), Michigan is actually #20 according to Forbes, not that I think highly of the publication. As you pointed out, Business Insider, which you also mentioned, also rates Michigan #20. Washington Monthly ranks Michigan #12. Jack Gourman ranks Michigan among the top 5 undergraduate institutions in the US. In fact, the USNWR is the only ranking that I know of that ranks Michigan out of the top 20. The only constant between all those rankings is that none of them is reliable.<br><br>The USNWR has a methodology designed with private universities in mind. For example:<br><br>1. The USNWR does not include state appropriations and their impact on financial aid in their Financial Resources Ranking. Michigan's financial standing is clearly among the top 15 in the US, arguably among the top 10. Its endowment of $8.4 billion is 6th largest in the land. When you factor in the $300 million in state appropriations, it is like adding $6 billion to the endowment. Other than HYPS, I cannot think of any university that has more financial resources than Michigan. Even on a per student basis, Michigan would be among the top 15 (with no real difference separating #10 from #15), and that would not take economies of scale and efficiencies into account.<br><br>2. Alumni donation rates. Public universities cannot solicit their alumni as aggressively as private universities do. Until recently, public universities did not even approach alums for donations while elite private universities have done so for ell over 100 years. Given the difference in philosophy and practice, it is not possible to compare public and private universities with each other. That being said, in recent years, Michigan has been blessed with generous donations from alums. In fact, if one were to look at donation size per donor, or even total donations per alum, Michigan would probably be among the top 10 or top 20. But given the differences in approach to soliciting donations...and reporting them, this criterion should not be part of any ranking that includes private and public universities.<br><br>3. Faculty resources rank is one of the most questionable. Private universities take such liberties in reporting class sizes and student to faculty ratios that it is impossible to trust this segment of the ranking. Most private universities pretend that graduate students do not exist and do not include graduate students in their calculations. Having student to faculty ratios in the 6:1 - 8:1 range may seem impressive, but if those universities included graduate students as do public universities, their ratios would increase to 11:1 or 12:1. Still excellent, but no longer impressive.<br><br>There is no doubt that if the USNWR improved its methodology and audited data for accuracy and consistency, public universities like Cal, Michigan and UVa would all be ranked among the top 20.<br><br>\"The New York Times has it out of the Top 100 Global Universities according to corporate recruiting.\"<br><br>The link you provided was not based on any survey conducted by the New York Times, it merely posted it. The link you provided above is based on a survey conducted by a French HR consulting firm, and the vast majority of the firms surveyed were European, with a few European-based firms in South America and North America included. The first year the survey was released, MSU was ranked in the top 50 while Michigan was not ranked in the top 100. The second year saw MSU drop out of the top 80 and Michigan jump in the top 100. It is fairly evident that many of those Europeans confused the two and rated MSU under the assumption it was Michigan. Eliminate confusion from the survey and Michigan would be ranked among the top 15 US universities. Not knowing the exact name of the University is not their fault. It is confusing to many Europeans that two universities can have the name \"Michigan\". That is not to say that Michigan does not have a very strong reputation in Europe. The Times and the QS rankings, both released by British institutions, rank Michigan among the top 15 US universities. According to the Times, Michigan's reputation ranking is #12 in the World and #9 in the US. Any US-based corporate recruiters' ranking would definitely have Michigan among the top 15, if not among the top 10, depending on the industry.<br><br>Ironically, the WSJ did conduct a survey on employer sentiment, but I am not sure you will like it.

I think Gerhard Casper (Yale-educated scholar, once dean of Chicago Law school and president of Stanford University from 1992-2000 said it best in his letter to the Editor if the USNWR:<br><br>\"...I am extremely skeptical that the quality of a university - any more than the quality of a magazine - can be measured statistically. However, even if it can, the producers of the U.S. News rankings remain far from discovering the method. Let me offer as prima facie evidence two great public universities: the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and the University of California-Berkeley. These clearly are among the very best universities in America - one could make a strong argument for either in the top half-dozen. Yet, in the last three years, the U.S. News formula has assigned them ranks that lead many readers to infer that they are second rate: Michigan 21-24-24, and Berkeley 23-26-27.\"<br><br><url>http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/president/speeches/961206gcfallow.html</url><br><br>Dr. Casper's opinion is fairly standard among the educated elites.

Your assumption that the confusion would not life Michigan from whatever ranking it had among US universities to the top 15 US universities assumes that there is a significant difference between Michigan's ranking (say it was #50 among US universities) and #15.

Just yesterday a few posters said \"the undergraduate lectures [electives] are a complete waste of time.\"<br><br>Intro-level lectures at Michigan seldom exceed 500 students. 600 or 700 lectures are virtually unheard of. And those large, intro-level lectures are quite common at all large research universities. Do you think those classes that enroll 400 or 500 students at Michigan will magically enroll only 70 or 80 students at Columbia or Harvard? Intro level lectures at Columbia and Harvard often enroll 200 students, some enroll as many as 300 or more students. Once you have more than 100 students, you can no longer boast of having a small classes. At that point, you will invariably move to a lecture-based format. Class size and faculty attention are not going to be the forte of any research university. If one wishes to have intimate, discussed based classes and the full attention of the faculty, LACs are the only way to go.<br><br>That being said, large lectures (anything over 100 students qualifies as large) are only common Freshman year. Typically, intermediate and advanced classes that Sophomores and upperclassmen take usually enroll fewer than 30 students (often fewer than 20), except in very popular majors such as Econ, Political Science and Psychology, where such classes will still enroll 50-150 students, but again, that is going to be the case at most elite research universities. Bottom line, one does not go to a research university if one wants an intimate classroom experience and the devotion of the faculty. Again if those are priorities, LACs are the only way to go.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\"You guys are so deluded it's incredible.\"<br><br>Classy as always.<br><br>\"The lifetime (business) connections you make attending Yale are easily worth $100,000.\"<br><br>First of all, in this case, the difference is not $100,000, it is $180,000. Secondly, if you want to talk about lifetime, saving $180,000 over four years of college is not exactly $100,000 over a lifetime is it? In fact, it will likely amount to well over a million dollars over a lifetime. I am not sure any connection is worth that much. In fact, most would agree that networking is vastly overstated. Just because you know many successful individuals will not make you successful. As you will one day painfully find out, connections will not stick their necks out, or go out of their way, to help you. Most people save their precious few connections for themselves and their children/family. The are not about to blow a possible favor on some college acquaintance. As Trinity has demonstrated via data published by Ross and Yale respectively, Ross grads outearn Yale graduates significantly. It is safe to say that employment opportunities for Ross grads are fairly good, even compared to those of Yale grads.<br><br>\"The abundance and quality of job offers that are avail to you as a Yale student simply don't exist in Ann Arbor, period.\"<br><br>Really? And are those extremely rare job offers that \"do not exist in Ann Arbor\" open to all Yale grads or only a select and lucky few? Care to name some of those firms that only recruit at Yale and not at Michigan? I have a list of all universities that recruit at Michigan (Ross and the CoE), but I am curious which firms recruit exclusively at Yale...and how many Yalies they actually hire.<br><br>\"Yale undergrad is ranked 25 spots higher than Michigan's undergrad for a very good reason.\"<br><br>In academic circles, Yale undergrad is only considered 5-10 spots better than Michigan undergrad. A ranking must truly manipulate data to stretch it to 25 spots. And even if the ranking you are alluding to were accurate, in a country with thousands of universities, 25 spots is hardly significant.<br><br>\"I'd be happy to post my acceptance letter from December.\"<br><br>Congratulations! But I am confused about something. Clearly, you believe you can do much better than Michigan. If Michigan does not match your standards, and clearly money is no factor in your case, why waste your money there? Why not attend a university worthy of your talents? I think you will be miserable at Michigan.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Vladenschlutte</b><br><br>\"\"That being said, large lectures (anything over 100 students qualifies as large) are only common Freshman year.

I recruit for IBanking at Ross and graduated with UM BBA in the 1980's. There is no huge IB recruting advantage Yale over Ross, in fact, certain firms favor Ross kids for being better versed in team type activities. However, certain IB firms are very close to Yale given senior mgmt ties. You will find that Yale places really well in sales and trading IB jobs given those ties. But for a straight-up Analyst position in Corp Fin for IBanking, there are probably slightly more Ross hires than Yale hires street-wide each year. The best mgmt consulting gigs, however, go to Yale. And on the east coast, you can't deny the overall Yale connection as being a difference maker. So I would recommend you sole-search a bit ... are you 100% sure you are East-bound after graduation and then plan to stay to maximize that Yale connection? If not, then Ross may be a better choice given its larger global alumni network and strong national recognition of the Ross BBA (and no debt!). Living in NYC with $180k in debt would be no fun ... but then again, working 100 hrs a week doesn't give time for much fun anyway. The IB analyst job is all about getting on a steep learning curve and building skills ... where you studied undergrad won't be that important 2-3 years down that road anyway. However, if you are 100% certain that the East Coast thing is what you \"want for a lifetime\" then Yale might be worth the extra money for that old-world, Ivy connection that can open some unique doors in NYC. The Michigan connection is strong on the east coast, but Yale has enjoyed a generational head-start that has higher-powered connectivity.<br><br>"]}
