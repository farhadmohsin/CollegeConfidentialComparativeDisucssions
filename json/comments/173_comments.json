{"title": "vanderbilt full tuition vs northwestern", "comments": ["<b>Username: COLLWGE1227</b><br><br>Hi,<br>My daughter is currently in crunch time trying to decide between two amazing schools - Vanderbilt University and Northwestern University. At Vanderbilt, she has received the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship and we, as a family, would be paying a lot more if she attended Northwestern. She loves both schools, but can\u2019t decide whether Northwestern is worth all of that money out of pocket. She wants to study the natural sciences (not sure specifically what yet) and eventually go on to medical school. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>No I would not pay the extra money personally or advise my children or friends that either<br><br>", "<b>Username: tk21769</b><br><br>Why is this hard?  You have a choice between 2 peer schools, she loves both, but one is much less expensive. You haven\u2019t given any reason to prefer Northwestern. So go with Vanderbilt and don\u2019t look back!<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>If she loves both I\u2019d go with Vandy.  Save the money to help her pay for med school (or anything else she ultimately may decide to do).<br><br>", "<b>Username: COLLWGE1227</b><br><br>@privatebanker @tk21769 @happy1 Thank you all for the responses! It truly means a lot! While she does love both schools, she slightly does prefer Northwestern for the quarter system and the ample amount of opportunities in the greater Chicago area that\u2019s a little closer to home. She tells me that she wouldn\u2019t mind either one though and thinks student life will be fine wherever she goes. Would you all take into consideration prestige for the \u201cnatural sciences\u201d program between the two schools as well?<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>I see no meaningful difference in prestige between Northwestern and Vandy.<br>If she strongly prefers Northwestern and you can comfortably (no debt, no hardship) manage undergrad as well as med school then by all means go for it.  If money is an issue especially with grad school in her future then I\u2019d opt for Vandy in a heartbeat.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Sorry. I don\u2019t have any insight into that other than what statistics etc  can be found online.<br><br>", "<b>Username: simba9</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>Would you all take into consideration prestige for the \u201cnatural sciences\u201d program between the two schools as well?<br>\"\"<br><br>No. I know Northwestern is a great school, but I don\u2019t really associate it with the natural sciences.  Economics and journalism come to mind when I think of Northwestern.<br>When I think of Vanderbilt, I think of health sciences first. That\u2019s probably because the medical school is such a big part of the campus, and when I visit my daughter in Nashville, there are always stories on the news and advertisements about the Vanderbilt Hospital.<br><br>", "<b>Username: COLLWGE1227</b><br><br>Thank you all for the responses so far - your insight truly is so helpful. Anyone else feel free to share their thoughts!<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>Northwestern is stronger overall academically, but not six-figures stronger. The slight differences in quality/prestige are not worth that much money, unless she hated Vandy, loved NU, and you had money to burn.<br>In my hair-splitting undergraduate private U tier system, Northwestern is one level above Vandy. One level isn\u2019t worth that much money unless, like I said, she is way in favor of NU and you can easily afford the cost difference.<br>For perspective, here\u2019s where I have them in my hair-splitting, anal-retentive tier system:<br>Tier 3:<br>Brown<br>Cornell<br>Dartmouth<br>Duke<br>Hopkins<br>Northwestern<br>Tier 4:<br>Emory<br>Georgetown<br>Notre Dame<br>Rice<br>Vanderbilt<br>Washington U<br>\u2026 and maybe CMU.<br>My tiers are based mainly on academic rep/quality, endowment, and (I\u2019m embarrassed somewhat to say) a small drop of prestige. But mostly it\u2019s based on academic rep and quality, as well as i\u2019m able to ascertain. I\u2019m strongly considering replacing prestige with undergraduate focus.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JayZee21</b><br><br>Choose Vandy!<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>I have posted on this topic elsehwere, but you need to keep in mind that medical school is an astounding amount of money, perhaps approaching 400,000 for a private medical school by the time medical school rolls around.  And you can\u2019t work in the summer and much of the aid is loan based, if any.  Log onto the medical school sites to see the tution now.  Now, I firmly reject the advice that you should invariably go for the cheaper school, because the primary basis to reduce medical school costs is to get into a highly competitive low cost school (Baylor) or a free medical school (Case Western speciality school) or an MD Ph.D or merit money.  So, if you are choosing between Yale and Alabama, go to Yale.  Yale is far more likely to get you a low cost medical school.  But here, there is no discernible basis to think that Vanderbilt/Northwestern split, whatever it might be, would result in a better shot at merit money in medical school.  And both would give you a fighting shot at one of the low cost options.  I would absolutely bank the money from the CV scholarship to pay for over a third of medical school and if you are fortunate enought to get merit money or something similar, you might be able to go almost free.  Good luck.<br>One more point, I did not appreciate until recently how crazy medical school admissions and finances are, despite having ample reason to know.  Although you need to enjoy the college experience, going to medical school does require a four year plan, including knowing how you are going to get in (many admission rates are sub-5%, that is, as hard to get in as Harvard undergraduate) and how you are going to pay those big bucks.  It is worth logging onto the medical school websites to realize that they do count parental income, even for a 26 year old \u201cchild\u201d.  On the other hand, not to be too much of a pessimist, right now is an amazing time to be involved in medicine and the journey, well expensive and difficult is worth it if it is your dream.<br><br>", "<b>Username: happymomof1</b><br><br>Can you even pay for Vanderbilt with this scholarship and no loans other than the standard federal student loans?  Would your family need to borrow more than that?  Start there.<br>If Vanderbilt\u2019s costs are easy to cover, how about the cost of Northwestern?  How secure is your daughter\u2019s college fund?  Is there the equivalent of four years at Northwestern sitting in a 529 or the like? Or would you need to cobble together the money every year from multiple sources and tighten your belts?<br>Provided Vanderbilt is possible without huge strain for the family, this looks pretty much like a no brainer to me.  The savings are significant and could go a long way toward helping with the costs of med school or just with helping your daughter launch into life after colege.  They also can give your daughter financial freedom while in college to take an unpaid or poorly paid internship that she really likes instead of having to pin down the best payong summer job or part time school year job that she can find.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>If I take prezbucky\u2019s list for fun and honestly reorder it for pure, \u201ccountry club\u201d prestige - as I call it.

But looks like most perspectives here illustrate that point that there is not a significant enough difference between Northwestern and Vanderbilt. And the CV scholarship is impressive.  So if she loves both schools and plans for med school then take the money and run to Vandy.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@waitingmomla <br><br>", "<b>Username: StanfordGSB00</b><br><br>@prezbucky - I agree with prezbucky\u2019s grouping. Vandy is a great school but it doesn\u2019t have the historical reputation that Northwestern has. Remember that as of 2-3 years ago, Vandy was a school ranked in the 18-22 range, competing with the likes of Emory, Rice, etc. Northwestern has been in the 9-13 ranking spot for the last 30 years. High school students are very impressionable by ranking shifts year-to-year but it takes DECADES to change perceptions. And if you take the average ranking for the last 20 years, Vandy is a top 20 school and certainly not a top 15 school. Based on attending Stanford for my MBA and living / working in NYC at a prestigious investment bank / mega private equity fund: my ranking would be.<br>Tier 1A: Duke / Northwestern / Brown / Hopkins / Dartmouth<br>Tier 1B: Cornell - I put this here because its selectivity is significantly less than the others. Ask anyone in a high-prestige job in NYC on Wall Street or ask students at top private prep schools (Dalton, Horace Mann, Trinity, Andover, Exeter, etc, ), they will put Cornell a step below the others. As of just a year ago, the average SAT at Cornell was almost a 90-100 points lower than Duke and Northwestern. That\u2019s significant. Cornell is really a hybrid of a private ivy league and a top tier public university like Michigan, given its state subsidized schools. Part of prestige relates to exclusivity and selectivity and Cornell is the least selective of the schools in Tier 1A and 1B.<br>Tier 2: Georgetown / Vanderbilt / Rice / Wash U / CMU<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>Maybe we can revise it to say that \u201cPrivate Cornell\u201d belongs with Duke, NU and the rest, while \u201cPublic Cornell\u201d belongs with UNLV, or at least the hotel school does. <br>In all seriousness, though, I have Cornell up there primarily because their academic rep seems to be pretty strong across the board, similar to NU and Duke. They aren\u2019t as selective, but my tiers aren\u2019t looking at that too much \u2013 they\u2019re based mostly on perceived academic quality/rep and endowment (the ability to spend money to benefit students\u2026).<br><br>", "<b>Username: mamaedefamilia</b><br><br>Weather is better at Vandy, just saying!<br>Seriously, great campus, wonderful for pre-med and I imagine that being a Cornelius Vanderbilt scholar comes with some nice perks and extra opportunities.  Given the differential in cost, I vote for Vandy!<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Both are great schools but the Cornelius Vanderbilt is quite an honor. Go for it!<br><br>", "<b>Username: COLLWGE1227</b><br><br>Hi all, thank you so much for your responses to the intial question!

The CV Scholarship is a great honor and and that nearly $250K of scholarship money will come in handy for med school. Given that she \u201cloves both schools\u201d there\u2019s really no reason to pay such a huge premium for her to go to NU (unless you truly have money to burn).<br><br>", "<b>Username: katliamom</b><br><br>You have a choice:<br>A new top-of-the-line Mercedes in blue, for almost free\u2026 or a new top-of-the-line Mercedes in green for tens of thousands of dollars.<br>Which do you pick?<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>The Cornell Hotel school is not only private but its alums give more than any other school to Cornell.

Again, everything on this site, including my comments, should be taken with skepticism.<br><br>", "<b>Username: IWannaHelp</b><br><br>Go to Vandy. Natural science and premed are not the fields you would want to spend much more for. The ROI isn\u2019t typically there to justify it even when the two schools are not peers.

The other thing that would lean to NU is that if you switch majors, NU is a little better across other majors, esp if you\u2019re considering engineering.  Say you start out pre-med, and you decide biomed engineering is better and you really like econ or history and would like to minor in it. NU would be the place to attend then.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CallieMom</b><br><br>@COLLWGE1227 , just about all the feedback you have received is consistent. Unless your child is repulsed by Nashville and Vanderbilt, I fail to understand why there is even a question.<br>Northwestern is not significantly more prestigious. They are not renowned for \u201cnatural sciences\u201d.  Vanderbilt has a first rate medical school and I can attest they are doing some really interesting and important research. Being close to the medical school is a huge plus. Your child might be able to shadow at Vandy Medical School or take some upper level courses or help with research over the summers.<br>Additionally, and just as importantly, it is crazy competitive to get accepted to medical school right out of college. If she needs to work and gain extra experience to beef-up her application post BS degree, having contacts and connections at Vanderbilt is a huge plus. She might be able to get some great job for a year or two in one of their many specialty clinics while she studies for her MCATs and applies to med schools.<br>The thought of my child being saddled with the cost of medical school at over 350K (not including the add\u2019l deferred interest costs if she choose to specialize in a field requiring many additional years of commitment) is not just concerning but flat out nauseating.<br>One other factor, if she is the recipient of the Cornelius Vanderbilt Scholarship, that is a feather in her cap for future admissions to graduate/medical school.<br>So, I would counsel my daughter simply: \" if you got, use it!\".  In other words, take the darn scholarship!<br>What are we missing?  Why is there even any question about not saving tuition costs now?<br><br>", "<b>Username: IWannaHelp</b><br><br>@CallieMom<br>Please see my post above. Northwestern is renowned for chemistry.
