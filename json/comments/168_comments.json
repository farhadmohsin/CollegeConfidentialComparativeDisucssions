{"title": "washu vs bowdoin", "comments": ["<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>Hi all, I was admitted to both schools (among others such as UCLA, Wesleyan, BC, YaleNUS) and they\u2019re my top picks right now. I\u2019m having a really hard time deciding because I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll fit in at both schools.<br>I\u2019m an international student and I want to study political science/philosophy (something in the humanities). I\u2019m quiet in a bigger crowd but really can\u2019t stop talking when I\u2019m with my friends. I chose to apply to WashU as the academics are stellar and the vibe seems to be super friendly (really important to me because as a transitioning international student I don\u2019t want to be homesick). What I\u2019m looking for in a school is a tight knit community where everyone\u2019s really friendly to each other, and a place where people have passions and are genuinely interested in intellectual conversations, etc.<br>One thing is I\u2019m afraid Bowdoin would be \u2018too small\u2019 and a bit rural.<br>I was leaning quite a bit towards Washu, However, I joined one of the WashU Girls group chats and the entire chat history was filled with the girls talking about dabs, juuls, vaping, weed, etc. I have nothing against drugs and stuff but I don\u2019t want to go to a school where that\u2019s the biggest \u2018thing\u2019 if you know what i mean? And I\u2019m not sure how huge greek life seems to be on campus\u2026 A lot of people in the facebook groups are planning to rush.<br>I guess I\u2019m looking for personal experiences/insights into how my situation would determine a leaning towards a certain school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hamurtle</b><br><br>WashU has the higher rated PoliSci program, but it comes down to the following:<br>(1) Educational quality<br>(2) Financial affordability<br>(3) Overall fit<br>I would ignore the GroupMes.  My son is in a bunch of them and barely checks them at all.  And my advice is to not check/post at all.<br>There isn\u2019t a big drug culture at all on campus.  St. Louis is definitely not Berkeley-we never noticed anything of the sort during our visits.<br>As for Greek life, it\u2019s not that pervasive.  You are under no pressure to join.<br>WashU is a collaborative environment.  My son isn\u2019t a PoliSci major (actually Biology/History) and is in multiple study groups.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Chipotbae</b><br><br>I wouldn\u2019t worry at all, that\u2019s definitely not the prevailing culture at WashU. I\u2019m also a part of those exact same chats and groups, and if you look at the roommate spreadsheet (which is still a fraction of the incoming students) you\u2019ll see a lot more variety in partying preference.<br>Wherever you go people will be into different things, but WashU actually has a great student culture where you\u2019re not pressured or expected to do things you don\u2019t want to do. I and the girls I\u2019ve talked with so far are more into pizza and movies (but to each her own, of course). And no matter how much people want to party, we\u2019re all going to get our butts kicked by hard (but engaging and cool!) classes and have to study a lot.<br>Like @Hamurtle said, WashU is super collaborative, and GroupMes don\u2019t provide the whole picture  Best of luck with your decisions!<br><br>", "<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>@Hamurtle the price of both schools are the same to me. I\u2019m struggling to evaluate fit though. What are some good ways to do that? I\u2019ve looked online at the classes, talked to some students\u2026 But it\u2019s still a struggle to see how I fit in there in the mix.

My wife\u2019s home city in China is has a population of 6 million but it\u2019s not that cosmopolitan in comparison to Beijing/Shanghai (it\u2019s a Northeastern rust belt dump of a city).<br>If the OP is used to \u2018big city life\u2019 so to speak, Maine is going to be a major cultural shock.  Even St. Louis is way more different than most American cities.  It\u2019s not as rushed as San Francisco/Los Angeles/New York.<br>WashU has an active Chinese students association.  Also if you\u2019re not used to Western food, there are better options to get Asian groceries in St. Louis than heading to a Chinese grocery in Boston every other weekend.<br><br>", "<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>@Hamurtle nah I\u2019m cool with western food haha  Well I live in HK which is kind of like New York. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the more physical aspect of culture shock (location, food, etc) that\u2019s freaking me out or the fear that I won\u2019t vibe well with the people there.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>\u201cAnd on the flip side St. Louis is fairly close enough to Chicago.\u201d<br>I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d consider 4.5 hrs driving close.

I feel like I\u2019m someone who thrives when I have really deep and meaningful connections with my friends and peers.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kiriel</b><br><br>@reindeercoffee  I would say so. It\u2019s not like a big state school where people bond over large sports events or whatnot but I\u2019m quite close to my friends that I have made in clubs and I see the same across others involved in greek life and other student organizations. The people here are all incredibly friendly so I don\u2019t think most people have any problems making meaningful connections with their peers.<br><br>", "<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>@Kiriel I hear a lot about how great washu is for premeds (and I don\u2019t doubt it!), but what would you say about the humanities courses at washu? (namely polisci and philosophy). Are they \u201cgood enough\u201d or would it be comparable to a humanities oriented LAC?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kiriel</b><br><br>@reindeercoffee Hi, although I\u2019m not too familiar with Washu\u2019s polisci or philosophy programs I will do my best to answer your questions. I would say that Washu artsci does follow a \u201cliberal arts\u201d curriculum meaning that they place a heavy emphasis on well-roundedness being STEM or the humanities. I have a few friends doing polisci and are interning at various congressional offices so if you\u2019re looking to go into politics Washu is a great place for that. If your plan after undergrad is to go into grad school, Washu is also very good as Washu has really great name recognition in academia and I have heard good things about grad school placements from all majors. Feel free to dm me with any further questions. If I can\u2019t answer them, I can try to ask some friends.<br><br>", "<b>Username: college_query</b><br><br>My S graduated from Bowdoin. We used to live in the Midwest and had also toured WashU. Both are wonderful schools and you are fortunate to have such great choices.<br>Bowdoin is small, and was smaller than my S\u2019s high school, but my S loved it there and made great friends he still keeps in contact with and gets together with.<br>The town of Brunswick isn\u2019t what I would call \u201crural\u201d but is a nice little college town. There is a train station and it\u2019s easy to get to Boston. As far as transportation, the closest airport is Portland. When my S was coming back from breaks, he usually found other Bowdoin students to share a taxi with. Since he graduated, there\u2019s a new Metro Bus that connects Portland to Brunswick.<br>St. Louis is obviously a different kind of place - the metro area is over 2 million. You can take the light rail commuter train from the airport to the campus. The WashU campus is very nice.<br>Both schools rank very highly for campus food.<br>Two of my S\u2019s former roommates are in graduate school at UCLA and Harvard, so if your future plan is graduate school, I think either place would prepare you well.<br>I think the decision comes down to: would you prefer a small town in the northeast, or a larger city in the Midwest?<br><br>", "<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>@college_query Wow thanks for the reply! Right now I\u2019m sure that academically I want to go to Bowdoin but socially I\u2019d fit better in WashU (from talking to people in my class and such). But I feel like the social aspect might be hard to judge because maybe I just haven\u2019t interacted enough with kids from my Bowdoin class!<br>One thing that has been on my mind is the \u2018hookup culture\u2019 that has been extensively written about in Bowdoin. It\u2019s probably hard to judge as a parent but would you/your son agree that this permeates the social atmosphere? Because if so It seems a lot like my high school right now (nobody in serious relationships, just hookups that become awkward social run ins) and it\u2019s not the environment I want to be in. However, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m letting something \u2018insignificant\u2019 on the grand scheme of things get in the way of the \u2018smart option\u2019. Also, Bowdoin seems to be super sport-oriented and outdoorsy which isn\u2019t something I\u2019d describe myself as. That, and the concern that the international student support won\u2019t be as extensive as at a bigger school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>The majority of colleges will have a hookup culture these days. Some participate, some do not. I can promise you people hookup at WUTSL as well.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Bowdoin is very small which has plus factors and negative factors. It is really nice but the school year weather wise  is a short fall and the rest is winter. Maybe a brief touch of spring for the next few weeks. They have a great outdoors club that attracts almost the whole school but it\u2019s winter sports and hiking for the most part.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>@reindeercoffee : In your case, the safer bet appears to be WashUStL even though both are outstanding options.<br><br>", "<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>@doschicos yeah, I understand that. It just seems to be the overwhelmingly prevalent culture at Bowdoin, from what I\u2019ve read many times over in their student newspaper and others who worry about it too on CC<br><br>", "<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>@Publisher I think so too, and I think talking to my friends they\u2019ve realized that too. As i\u2019ve mentioned before I already know I prefer Bowdoin academically and WUSTL socially, and it\u2019s really down to which one I value more which I\u2019m unsure of. However a significant barrier right now would be with my parents, who are decidedly on the Bowdoin camp because of the better academics and \u2018grad prospects\u2019. I do agree that humanities wise, it has the edge.<br>I had a talk with them tonight (lots of tears involved) and it really comes down to the fact that yeah they understand that social life is a big part of college but \u201cschool is school\u201d and the expenses they\u2019re paying for me to study in the states should come with a good \u2018return\u2019 if that makes sense.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>What makes you & your parents think that the academics are better at Bowdoin College ?<br>To the best of my knowledge, this is not accurate. Both are outstanding schools with respect to academics. WashUStL is a much larger school, a university as opposed to a small liberal arts college, which offers a larger variety of courses & social opportunities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>Both are fine academic institutions. It\u2019s not like WUSTL is some faceless school with big classes. You\u2019ll get the LAC-like small classes there as well. I think you should base your decision on fit.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>I am sad for you. Your parents are making the best decision for you in their minds. It\u2019s becsuse they love you and want all the best for you in life. If they can find an advantage for you the they want you to have it.<br>The problem is that wash u in some circles, especially anyone with New England or NE roots doesn\u2019t know the school very well. Or USNWR moving bowdoin up the most recently has made a surge in interest.<br>It\u2019s more about a top LAC versus a top small university. Wash u is just as good. But a bit different. There are other rankings out there. Find some that project how great wash u is and show them. Also they are top 20 in the most crowded category with heavy weights hypsdg and the ucs etc How would bowdoin rank if rated against that group. Very high but not number 3.<br><br>", "<b>Username: reindeercoffee</b><br><br>@Publisher I mean that for my major polisci (Govt and legal studies) it would be better at Bowdoin. I think that the two are definitely on par with each other academically, but just as how if I was Premed the choice would easily be WashU, Bowdoin has the edge on g&ls<br><br>", "<b>Username: mamaedefamilia</b><br><br>@reindeercoffee  Congratulations on your acceptances - there is no bad choice here.<br>My daughter considered both schools, we toured both, and she liked both for different reasons.  Here are my impressions:<br>Both places have smart, qualified, motivated students and strong faculty so there\u2019s no bad choice on the academics.  Wash U is larger so there are more faculty and more courses available.  I don\u2019t know about the Poli Sci department at Bowdoin but the one at Wash U has an excellent reputation.  Humanities overall are good quality - it\u2019s much more than a pre-med program.<br>Wash U felt somewhat more pre-professional and applied than Bowdoin.  This is a matter of degree, not an absolute.<br>Bowdoin\u2019s student body feels quite preppy and sporty, although Bowdoin also cares about diversity - being an early adopter of test-optional admissions reflects that commitment.<br>Wash U has a LOT of Asian and Asian-American students, which may be a plus for you.<br>Food is fantastic at both (at least by Western standards).<br>Hookup culture - you will find it anywhere.  And you will find students that are more geared towards serious relationships.  And you will find students that have yet to date.  Chances are, if you don\u2019t party, it will be easy to avoid hookup culture.<br>Partying you will find anywhere but also it\u2019s easily avoided.  Both campuses will have outside speakers, concerts, and other events that don\u2019t involve drugs or alcohol.<br>Social media is not representative of student bodies as a whole.<br>Location: Access to Wash U is probably slightly easier.  You\u2019d likely fly in to Chicago and then a domestic flight to STL.  Public transportation (light rail and buses) is very good.  For Bowdoin, you\u2019d probably fly into Boston and then to Portland by train or air (Portland is a smaller airport with fewer flights) and then from Portland take a shuttle or train to campus.  St. Louis is definitely more urban (although Wash U is more suburban, surrounded by upscale residential neighborhoods and a shopping/restaurant/club area called the Delmar Loop which is within walking distance of campus).  There is also a huge and beautiful public park nearby with free zoo, museums, etc.  Given its a large metro area, internship opportunities nearby are likely to be more abundant than at Bowdoin.  Bowdoin is a small, safe, charming town.  If you like outdoor recreation, mountains and coastline are easy to access and the Bowdoin Outing Club is very active.<br>Both campuses have rail service right next door.  From Bowdoin you can take a train to Portland - medium-sized, picturesque, and nearby, or Boston, larger and farther away.  Light rail from Wash U can get you into the city of STL and from there, points farther afield.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>Bowdoin College is a great liberal arts college. But I am not sure that I agree that Bowdoin is clearly better in your desired area of study\u2014I don\u2019t know. I do know that political science & government is the most popular major at Bowdoin & probably a very strong department, but that doesn\u2019t mean that WashUStl is not strong in those areas.<br>As you know, one school has 1,800 undergraduates & the other has almost 7,000 undergraduates. The larger school should have a wider variety of course offerings.<br>An important factor in favor of Bowdoin College is the 12 school exchange program which allows Bowdoin students to study for a semester or a year at other member schools which includes Dartmouth College, Amherst, Williams Mystic Seaport Program, Wesleyan, Wellesley, Smith, and 5 other schools<br>The other schools are Connecticut College, Mount Holyoke College, Trinity College, Vassar College & Wheaton College\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: college_query</b><br><br>I can\u2019t really comment on the hookup culture at Bowdoin, but I assume it\u2019s probably similar at most college campuses.

So he wasn\u2019t dating anyone at Bowdoin during his time there.<br>My S is not outdoorsy at all, and was not an athlete, but he does love cold weather. He had never been in the state of Maine before he did a trip the summer before his senior year of high school, but fell in love with Bowdoin and applied ED.<br>I think both schools are academic peers. My S did a minor in Government & Legal Studies (majored in History and a foreign language) and really enjoyed his time at Bowdoin. He is still on the east coast, finishing his second year of law school, and goes back to Bowdoin for homecoming and graduation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hamurtle</b><br><br>History, Philosophy, and Political Science are highly rated at WashU and I would make the call for WashU over Bowdoin.  But it\u2019s OPs decision ultimately.<br>Somebody did mention the transportation factor.  St. Louis is closer to Hong Kong than Boston and Lambert International doesn\u2019t have as many flight cancellations as Logan International.

I bet very few people in Hong Kong/Asia in general have heard of Bowdoin.  Unless  you\u2019re going to law/graduate school, a Political Acience/Philosophy major isn\u2019t going to open too many doors in Asia.  Not that there is anything inherently wrong with that.<br>I admire someone who\u2019s breaking the Asian STEM stereotype, but unless OP is related to Li Kashing or the Ho family, there isn\u2019t much of a future unless the correct school is selected.

For many international students, an American degree is prestigious.
