I think you are putting the cart before the horse.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Eeyore123</b><br><br>Trying to have $70k in free cash flow in 2-3 years is going to be tough. Never underestimate your ability to spend what you earn. If you would have told me in high school that I would be earning what I am today, I would think I would have a lot more spending money. The problem is your feeling of wealth is very localized. If you are making $200k/ but everyone around you makes $300k, you will feel poor. If instead you are around people making $100k, you will be rich.<br><br>", "<b>Username: donnaleighg</b><br><br>Entry level CS jobs from great schools (or even not so great schools) may well pay over 100k, which sounds like a lot, but they are almost always in cities where the cost of living makes it hard to save more than 10k or so (after taxes). Just a fact of life. I know, both my kids are in that situation. Not complaining-- they are debt free, but there's not a whole lot of room to pay off debt.<br><br>", "<b>Username: millie210</b><br><br>All the schools youre interested in have career services offices. Why dont you just email them, explain that youre from India, love their school, but want to be realistic about your ability to find employment in the US after graduation and ask them what the current situation is for Indians w/o us citizenship or a green card who want H1-B visas?<br><br>Please do not tell them how youve got to make big money right away.<br><br>"]}
