The decision will become more clear when you have all the cards laid out in front of you.<br><br>Duke and Georgia Tech engineering grads will be offered comparable jobs at comparable pay. Engineering employment is highly market driven...new engineering grads are paid a similar starting salary, with possible premiums for better grades. The difference between Duke and GT is not large enough for you to command a larger starting salary, based on school quality alone.<br><br>If possible, visit both campuses.<br><br>", "<b>Username: FellowCCViewer</b><br><br>Does overall prestige matter to you?<br><br>", "<b>Username: UCBChemEGrad</b><br><br>IMO:<br><br>Duke > GT<br>GT Engineering > Duke Engineering<br><br>I think this is the OP's dilemma.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bluedog</b><br><br>Dana is correct according to my understanding. I graduated from Duke with a degree in biomedical engineering. Georgia Tech definitely has a higher regarded/higher ranked engineering school than Duke partially because GT offers 12 undergraduate majors, 20 masters degrees, and 16 PhD degrees in 9 different departments, while Duke offers about third of that - only 4 undergrad/PhD majors in 4 departments. So, it's not really a true comparison. Georgia Tech also has over 7,000 undergraduate students in engineering, while Duke has only around 1,200. The sheer volume of research would clearly be larger at Georgia Tech since they have so many more students and faculty so more people would be aware of GT's program.<br><br>However, you should really be comparing on a department-by-department basis. For example, if you are interested in biomedical engineering, Duke is widely seen as having one of the best programs in the nation (ranked 2nd in USN&amp;WR to JHU). If, however, you are interested in aerospace, industrial, or nuclear engineering, it is obvious you should choose GT since Duke doesn't even offer these programs. From personal experience, I can tell you that at Duke, the BME, ECE, and ME departments are top notch with great faculty and research opportunities (more than 2/3 of undergrads do research). The Civil Engineering department is kinda seen as a joke compared to the others and undergrads like to joke that students there are just in Trinity (the arts &amp; sciences school at Duke). Although the Civil Engineering does have a few great faculty members - notably Henry Petroski and Earl Dowell. But civil is seen as a notch below. The Princeton Review just ranked Duke's graduate engineering school second in the nation so it is definitely seen as prestigious. If you aren't sure what type of engineering you want to go into, well, then other factors will have to be weighed. I tend to think that a lot more Pratt graduates go into business than at an engineering school like GT, although plenty still stay within engineering. So if you might be interested in business down the line, Duke might be a better choice. Obviously, cost, prestige, campus culture, athletics, campus, liberal arts academics, job opportunities, graduate school prospects, etc. should play a role.<br><br>I think the job placement is probably very similar, although I'm sure there is a more diverse array of engineering firms that recruit at GT since there are just so many more students, while particular niche firms continually recruit at Duke as well as the major ones. But, I'd venture to guess it's not <i>significantly</i> different.<br><br>I personally wanted to get an engineering degree in the context of a great liberal arts education. I chose Duke over the engineering schools at Penn, Columbia, Michigan, and Illinois. So, I was kind of in your same situation. Cost is also a factor obviously - I was from IL and IL is widely seen as a great engineering school, but I wanted to expand my horizons more and get out of the state. Plus, they didn't even have a biomedical engineering department (14+ departments and no bme?!?), and Duke gave me lots of fin aid money (obviously, still more expensive than in-state IL).<br><br>Anyways, good luck with your decision! I'd probably apply RD to both since it seems like you are undecided. Don't go into ED without being 100% sure of your choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lvilleslacker</b><br><br>Um...<br>\"The Princeton Review just ranked Duke's graduate engineering school second in the nation so it is definitely seen as prestigious.\"<br><br>what?

See <url>http://www.princetonreview.com/grad/research/articles/find/pdfs/EngineeringPressRelease_Sept_20_2006.pdf</url> and for the rankings see <url>http://www.princetonreview.com/grad/research/articles/find/engineering.asp</url><br><br>According to PR,<br>1. UC-SB<br>2. Duke<br>3. UVA<br>4. Mich St<br>5. Johns Hopkins<br>....<br><br>I agree that list is pretty strange now that I look at it. Besides the details about the PR ranking, my point was merely to say that Duke is seen as a fairly prestigious engineering program, and is especially up-and-coming. It is not seen as an annual engineering powerhouse such as MIT, Berkeley, etc. because it doesn't have the same history, does not have nearly as many departments or faculty, etc. Of course, MIT and Cal Tech are seen as more prestigious for the vast majority of engineering programs (BME being the exception).<br><br>Anyways, Duke engineering rocks. They treat you like gold, the students are very intelligent and motivated, and they give you free beer on Friday during E-kegs....I loved it. But you can't go wrong with GT either. Definitely very different schools, overall, though, so you gotta go with what you like.<br><br>Also, note that there is about a 25% dropout rate for engineering nationwide (I think it's about 20% for Duke). So while you might not think you would want to transfer out in a million years, I know a bunch of people who did, and you might want to consider what school would be better for you if that did occur. On a similar note, like 40% of Duke freshman are pre-med (I'm making up this number), and by the end, the number is much less.<br><br>", "<b>Username: icy9ff8</b><br><br>Georgia Tech is a much better school for engineering. Lots of brilliant students at Georgia Tech. As cost is a concern, apply RD to both. Your concern regarding brighter students at one school versus the other are unwarranted.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lvilleslacker</b><br><br>i'm sorry, that list is absolutely ridiculous.<br><br>the schools i named, mit/calt/stan/berk/carn AREN'T EVEN ON IT.<br><br>You're seriously going to point to a ranking in which those schools are not considered the top 20 in the country for engineering?<br><br>Yes, it's BME is quite well regarded. but overall, duke engineering is not held in highest regards; it is certainly not number 2 in the country. It's prestige comes from the strength of the student body and the university overall, not because of its engineering strength in particular.<br><br>", "<b>Username: UCBChemEGrad</b><br><br>^ Gee, don't rip on the guy...It's not his list. He was merely pointing out the strength of his school.<br><br>He even agreed that the list looked \"pretty strange\".<br><br>", "<b>Username: wobudong</b><br><br>If your stats are good enough for Pratt, you can go to GaTech free if you are a Ga resident. Maintaining the grades to keep the Hope at GaTech, however, is a challenge. If you keep the Hope for four years, the difference in cost will be about 160,000. My son had the same decision. His sister and brother in law were both Duke grads, the latter BME. Son opted for GaTech for ME. GT engineering can be overly demanding academically and GT certainly does not have the social life that Duke offers due to GT's dismal female/male ratio. If you are convinced that you want to be an engineer, however, GT does not take a back seat to anyplace. When my son interviewed for jobs his senior year, not a single company asked his GPA. It seems that surviving GT engineering was more than enough.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lvilleslacker</b><br><br>alright, I apologize for coming off as a bit aggressive.

I merely mentioned it in passing with a 20-word sentence in the middle of a paragraph in the middle of a 564-word post (or 3.5% of my single post) because I recall hearing that Duke was ranked second. It's not like it was central theme in my post. To be perfectly honest, I had never actually looked at the complete list until you and another person called me a liar. That's all. You can disregard those 20 words in my original post and read the other 544 words that talk about attractive aspects of Pratt. Both GT and Duke are great - can't go wrong with either really. I think rankings are generally stupid and overemphasized anyways. Cheers!<br><br>", "<b>Username: UCBChemEGrad</b><br><br>^ Haha...did you actually count the words in your post?! And calculated a percentage to boot...LOL<br><br>You truly are an engineer...:D<br><br>", "<b>Username: bluedog</b><br><br>^^ Yes, yes, I try. :) I didn't actually count the words by hand - I used a MATLAB algorithm that counts words instantly by measuring the spaces between text after taking a screen shot using WinSnap.<br><br><br><br>Nah, I'm just kidding...I used Word Count in MS Word...Took me like 5 seconds, which I thought wasn't too much time to prove a point.

Somehow, the Duke engineers even had a higher range on the VERBAL section of the SAT than Trinity (700-770 vs. 680-770). So, overall SAT range for Duke engineering was 1450-1570, meaning 25% of engineers got 1580+ (note: Duke doesn't really care about the writing score and counts it the equivalent of an SATII score).<br><br><url>http://www.admissions.duke.edu/jump/applying/who_2011profile.asp</url><br><br>According to GT's own admission's site, the SAT range for matriculating students was 650-730 for math and 1250-1400 overall for the class of 2011 (still, quite good).<br><br><url>http://www.admiss.gatech.edu/studentstats/</url><br><br>", "<b>Username: danas</b><br><br>bluedog...<br>A common mistake, you are quoting the figures for accepted students at Duke, not enrolled.<br>The College Board's figures ARE for the class of 2010, though.<br><br>", "<b>Username: luckybug38</b><br><br>you dont add up low 25% of math and verbal to get low 25% of composite math-verbal score.
