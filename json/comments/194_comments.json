{"title": "amherst vs harvey mudd engineering vs medicine", "comments": ["<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>Hey everyone,<br>I\u2019m a Canadian student who just graduated from a NE boarding school this past spring.  I\u2019m currently taking a gap year and will be applying to college in a month\u2019s time.<br>I\u2019m a competitive swimmer and I\u2019m being recruited to Amherst College & Harvey Mudd College.  I haven\u2019t decided yet what I\u2019d like to focus on in college, though I\u2019ve narrowed it down to either medicine or engineering.<br>I know these two LACs are pretty different, so I\u2019d appreciate opinions on where I should apply ED.<br>Amherst: I\u2019m especially attracted to the Open Curriculum and research opportunities in the Consortium.  Given my experience at my high school, I think I\u2019d enjoy the social scene a bit more, too.  I talked to the swim coach and he offered to support my application (he said that in his time at Amherst, only one student who\u2019s had his support & applied ED hasn\u2019t been admitted\u2026 basically if I decide to apply ED, I should be accepted).  If I go to Amherst, I\u2019d start on a premed track with med school admission the ultimate goal.<br>Harvey Mudd: my parents and I feel that having an engineering degree from here is valuable, and it\u2019s nice that I\u2019ll be able to start working right after undergrad rather than having to go to grad school.  I\u2019m also interested in Mudd\u2019s Clinic Program, the Claremont Consortium and the supposedly collaborative environment.  I\u2019m still waiting to hear back from my pre read, but I had the coach\u2019s support last year when I considered applying ED, so I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ll have his support again this year, should I apply ED.<br>Does anyone have advice for me, given that I\u2019m still unsure of what career I\u2019d like to have?  I\u2019ve always been attracted to medicine, but I know the road\u2019s long and expensive.  STEM was my strong suit in high school, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to handle the rigorous engineering program at Mudd.  Any other things I should consider, apart from cost (Amherst will likely be a bit cheaper, but I think a Harvey Mudd degree will \u201cpay back\u201d quicker, so my parents aren\u2019t too concerned with the tuition fees)?<br>Thanks in advance!<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>If you think you want to go to med school, I\u2019d skip Mudd.  Being an athlete on top of the need for a very high GPA is almost impossible there.  My kid just graduated from there.  She mostly loved it, but the workload is grueling, and they don\u2019t really have grade inflation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: simba9</b><br><br>Why is swimming an issue if you\u2019re not getting an athletic scholarship?<br>I agree that if you\u2019re interested in med school, forget about engineering at Mudd. But if you\u2019re more interested in engineering than medicine, it\u2019s hard to beat Mudd.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Corbett</b><br><br>Amherst is great for pre-med, but maybe not so good for engineering. The only way to get an engineering degree at Amherst would be through a 5-year program, where you spend years 3 and 5 at Dartmouth. Such programs are commonly offered by liberal arts colleges, but rarely utilized in practice;. Amherst says that only one or two students per class go that route.<br>http://www3.amherst.edu/~waloinaz/engineering.html<br>HMC is great for engineering, but maybe not so good for pre-med. HMC does offer common pre-med majors, like biology and chemistry, although they are less popular than engineering. However, it may be difficult to maintain a high GPA at Mudd, as noted above, especially if you also want to swim competitively:<br><br>\"\"<br>Prospective pre-medical students considering Harvey Mudd should realize that the College\u2019s technical requirements are considerably more demanding than in typical pre-med programs<br>\"\"<br><br>https://www.hmc.edu/biology/programs-and-courses/pre-med-preparation/<br>So while both paths are theoretically possible at both institutions, you should assume that Amherst sends far more students to med school than into engineering, while HMC sends far more students into engineering than to med school. So in practice, these two schools may not be the best choices if you are truly undecided and want to keep both options open.<br>There are few LACs that are good for both pre-med and engineering. Swarthmore would be an obvious pick, or Smith if you are female. If you can swim competitivelly at a low Division I level, then Bucknell or Lafayette. If you want to stick to Division III, then maybe consider small DIII universities, like Tufts or Rochester, as well as LACs.<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>Why is swimming an issue if you\u2019re not getting an athletic scholarship?<br>\"\"<br><br>Lots of students want to continue their sport in college, and compete at the DIII level because it is something they love and are good at.  I think it is perfectly legitimate to want to swim in college.  BUT\u2026 I do agree that having it as a driver for where to apply is maybe short sighted.  As @Corbett says, neither is ideal for what the OP wants.  Honestly, I suspect it would be grueling to keep the needed GPA for med school at Amherst as well (not quite as much as Mudd, but still super challenging \u2013 not much time for anything but sport and studying).  I also think Swarthmore is a risky choice \u2013 again, VERY difficult academically (my kid picked Mudd over Swat, but liked both because she wanted the highest level of academic intensity she could find).  I wouldn\u2019t pick a top 5 LAC in general to do a sport and pre-med \u2013 stiff competition for the grades you need there.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br>Harvey Mudd has a core curriculum that covers many of the pre-med course requirements; the remaining ones can be taken as electives, regardless of major.  However, the academic intensity is high (regardless of major), and the large core curriculum (including HSA requirements) means that cherry picking courses that you are most likely to get A grades in is more difficult.<br>In contrast, Amherst has no general education requirements, which means that you can cherry pick courses that you are most likely to get A grades in to boost your GPA for pre-med purposes.  But there is no native engineering degree program.<br>You can do pre-med as an engineering major at many schools, but the high volume of non-overlapping requirements for most types of engineering and pre-med course requirements can make it difficult to fit all of the course work into four academic years of normal course loads.  Adding intercollegiate athletic workload makes that even more difficult.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Much2learn</b><br><br>@ccthunderfin<br>You might wish to consider a small D1 schools that would offer both and provide flexibility like Lehigh or Lafayette. They are very challenging academically, but just a bit less intense than the most difficult schools. There is real value to attending a school where you can change your mind later, should you decide to switch, or even do both.<br>Also, a bio engineering major would not need many added courses to meet the pre-med requirements.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Corbett</b><br><br>If you are torn between medicine and engineering, then biomedical engineering seems like a possible fit. You could start in a BioE program to see how it goes. If you liked the engineering part more, you could stay in BioE, or you could switch to a more traditional engineering discipline. If you liked the biomedical part more, you could switch to a traditional pre-medical program.<br>You would find both biomedical engineering and DIII swimming at at smaller universities like Tufts, Rochester, Case Western, RPI, or WPI. Bucknell would be a LAC option, but they have DI swimming. Tufts competes in NESCAC, the same DIII league as Amherst.<br><br>", "<b>Username: juillet</b><br><br>Well, just based on your post here, it sounds like you actually like specific features of Amherst. The only things that seem to attract you to HMC are the fact that you can have an engineering degree and the Claremont Consortium - but Amherst is in the Five College Consortium.<br>You can also start working right after undergrad from Amherst - you don\u2019t need a graduate degree just because you don\u2019t go into engineering. Most college students do start working right after college, especially from a college like Amherst.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ThankYouforHelp</b><br><br>Reading your post, I don\u2019t see any indication that you WANT to be an engineer.   If you actually do, then don\u2019t go to Amherst.  It\u2019s a fantastic school for everything that it offers, and opens doors to graduate schools, professional schools, Wall Street, and other careers at the level of the Ivies, but it does not offer engineering.  If you want to be an engineer, go to Mudd.<br>You need to make that decision first.  The rest will fall into place.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SwimDad99</b><br><br>@intparent One of the key reasons to pursue swimming at Amherst and HM is because it\u2019s the coaches who will get him admitted. Otherwise both schools are a reach for just about anyone. Of course, once he\u2019s admmitted and given the swimming thing a fair effort (say, for one year) he could quit.<br>I would just advise the OP that a promise of support from Coach Nichols at Amherst is worth a heck of a lot more than a promise of support at HM. As you point out, Nichols gets his guys admitted. HM and the other Claremont McKenna colleges have a reputation for over-promising to prospective athletes on occasion \u2014 the process of athletic support has been in place much longer and is more established in the NESCAC. And, of the five schools in the consortium, Harvey Mudd is the one LEAST interested in sports and in supporting athletes at admission. If you were truly driven to study Engineering, then I\u2019d encourage you to assume a bit more risk and apply ED to Harvey Mudd. But given your ambivalence, I think you have to factor in the difference in coach support between the two schools (and more generally between the NESCACs and the five colleges of the consortium) and go with the bird-in-the-hand, Amherst. I\u2019d hate to see you lose the nearly certain ED admission at Amherst and then fail to secure admission at HM. After the ED round, you\u2019d be SOL at Amherst. Coach support in the NESCAC works only in the ED round.<br>If you do decide to apply ED at HM, I\u2019d encourage you to line up support for EDII. Middlebury could help you there. And you\u2019d really like Coach Rueppel.<br>Good luck!<br>p.s. You might also grow your short list to include Pomona, CMC, Williams, and Swarthmore.<br><br>", "<b>Username: artloversplus</b><br><br>What is your safety? None of the schools discussed here are safety schools, not even matches, other than you are a recruited athletes. As a premed, you should not go to a school if your stats are not at least top 25% of the entering class. To me, you should work on some  thing much lower to survive the premed weed out. Perhaps some thing like your IS public, they should have swimming as recruits.<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>Getting into a college where your admission is questionable to start with, and adding the pressure of athletics in top of that is not a recipe for getting the necessary grades for me school.  Although international student admissions to med school in the US are a whole different kettle of fish that someone else may be able to speak to.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SwimDad99</b><br><br>\u201cGetting into a college where your admission is questionable to start with, and adding the pressure of athletics in top of that is not a recipe for getting the necessary grades for me school.\u201d<br>I\u2019m surprised that an experienced CC poster would make that statement in reference to top LACs, @intparent. Admission to Amherst or HM is \u201cquestionable\u201d for virtually everyone. The admission rates at those schools are in the mid-to-low teens, and even extraordinarily well prepared students are rejected by the hundreds every year. Additionally, nearly half of the students at these top LACs are varsity athletes. Are you really suggesting that these talented young people can\u2019t handle sports and a pre-med major? Most would find that proposition laughable \u2013 my own son among them.<br>Now if you\u2019re talking about DI athletics at the Big Ten or SEC level, then you may have a point. But these are D3 programs that work extraordinarily hard to create an environment where student athletes can flourish. And they do \u2013 often while juggling pre-med courses.<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>I agree that admissions to those schools are very selective, and the OP may be as qualified as any other applicant.  But SOMETIMES athletic recruits are in the lower end of the applicant pool in terms of test scores and or grades.  They are hooked, so can get a slight edge there.  If the OP falls in that category, honestly, and wants to get the grades needed for med school, it might not be the best choice to be competing against (1) students with somewhat higher academic qualifications, and (2) students who don\u2019t have the same commitment to a time intensive EC.<br>I suspect it is easier at Amherst than Mudd.<br>https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=students-study-most<br>This isn\u2019t an exaggeration.  My kid worked insanely hard just to pass her classes there.  No way could she have stacked a sport on top of it (and her GPA was still not med-school worthy).  Her friends who were athletes really struggled to keep up, too.  Mudd is a great school.  But it is not a great place for pre-meds to start with.<br>Most schools have some students in premed who don\u2019t do much but study.  There is something to be said for going to a slightly easier school if that is you chosen path so you can keep the needed GPA.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SwimDad99</b><br><br>@intparent \u2013 Yes, that all makes sense. I\"m sure there are special cases \u2013 even at D3 \u2013 where it would be very difficult for a student athlete to juggle their sport plus pre-med (or Engineering). And it doesn\u2019t surprise me that Harvey Mudd might be one of those special cases. It\u2019s exceptionally rigorous. But Williams, Amherst, CMC, Pomona, Middlebury \u2013 these are schools where the large pluralities of the students are varsity athletes, and most chose D3 just so that they could find the right balance between sport and school. And, by all accounts, most do that very well.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ThankYouforHelp</b><br><br>Sports at either of these places will be an activity, not a lifestyle.  School always comes first.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@intparent, yeah if I go to Mudd I won\u2019t be doing anything pre-med related.  I\u2019d be do engineering there.  That\u2019s why I need to decide between pursuing medicine or just doing engineering.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@simba9 it\u2019s not an issue per say; I just included it in my post since it\u2019s my \u201chook\u201d for admission into these selective schools.  Both schools in my opinion have a good balance of academics and athletics, and I\u2019m hoping to swim all 4 years in college.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@Corbett thanks for the info.  Yeah, I read into that 3-2 engineering program a bit but it doesn\u2019t seem very popular.  I\u2019m actually in contact with Swarthmore\u2019s swim coach right now, but it\u2019s not need blind compared to Amherst, so it\u2019d be more expensive.  I\u2019ve also heard it\u2019s extremely academically rigorous, which turns me off - if you have any opinions about that, I\u2019d love to hear them.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@intparent Just want to clarify that swimming is not dictating where I\u2019ll be applying, the only reason I mentioned it is because it\u2019s my \u201chook\u201d to get into these colleges.  I\u2019ve met both coaches and would be happy swimming at either program.  As a side question, I know Swarthmore is very hard (which is why despite getting interest from the coach I\u2019d rather not apply there), but is Amherst that difficult?  By no means am I saying that balancing a sport & having a 4.0 is easy, but I thought it\u2019s doable to try pre med and play a DIII sport.  Would love more info if possible, as I\u2019m considering just staying in Canada to do pre med instead (though most universities here grade harshly, too!).  Thanks.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@ucbalumnus Yep, I definitely wouldn\u2019t do pre med at Harvey Mudd.  Out of curiosity, if I was 100% set on medicine, would you suggest just staying in Canada to do the requirements (much cheaper, but I heard most universities here grade harshly, too)?  Thanks.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@Much2learn Thanks for the suggestions, though I probably wouldn\u2019t apply to those schools since I\u2019m international and I\u2019d be paying full sticker price for an education I could receive in Canada.  And yeah, I\u2019ve considered bio engineering before.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@Corbett I\u2019ve heard job prospects for bioengineering aren\u2019t great-- is that true (this is assuming the med school path doesn\u2019t work out and I just land up with a bioengineering degree)?  I probably wouldn\u2019t apply to those schools since I\u2019m international and would be paying full tuition.  Thanks again though.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@ThankYouforHelp yeah, that\u2019s the main thing I\u2019m still trying to decide.  My parents are sort of pressuring me to do engineering since they don\u2019t think I can last through the next 15 years of becoming a doctor.  They think engineering will just be 4 years and then I can start working.  Certain aspects of engineering (especially sustainable/env. engineering) have appealed to me, but I have never had shadowing experience / classes for engineering, so I don\u2019t know much about the field.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@SwimDad99 Thanks for your comments, think I\u2019ve seen you post in the Athletic Recruit section on CC before\u2026 does your kid go to a NESCAC?  I didn\u2019t mention this in my original post, but I applied to Harvey Mudd RD last year, though ended up getting waitlisted.  At my interview back in the summer of 16 the Dean of admissions said that if I applied ED with coach\u2019s support & no asking of FA, my chances of admission were \u201cvery good\u201d.  Didn\u2019t end up doing that in the end, but I think that if I hypothetically apply ED this year I have decent chances.  I do agree with you that Amherst is a probably slightly safer bet.  Funny you say that, I was in contact with Coach Rueppel until Amherst offered me.  I talked to Swarthmore a bit, but I prefer the culture at NESCACs.  Was in contact with Coach Kuster, but they\u2019re not looking for breaststrokers this year.  Not really interested in Pomona or CMC.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCThunderfin</b><br><br>@artloversplus my safety is just going to school in Canada.

Is it better to just stay in Canada?

Just engineering.  And my stats are 35 superscored ACT, 2 subject tests &gt;700.<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>From your comments above, I feel like a few things should be clarified around financial aid.  Unless you are a US citizen, likely Amherst is the only school on your list that will \u201cmeet need\u201d for you.  There are only 5 schools in the US that are need blind and meet need for internationals, and Amherst is on that list. Mudd (and Swat) are not.  I know for a fact that Mudd is very specific in saying this to international students that you very likely will NOT get your full need met.  I think Swat will be the same.  You mentioned being need blind above \u2013  that means a college won\u2019t reject your application because you need FA, but it has nothing to do with whether they will offer enough aid for you to attend.<br>Also, I get the impression you want to go to med school in the US.  There are a small number of med schools in the US that treat Canadians like US citizens in admission, but nearly all consider them international.  It is extremely hard for international students to gain admission to US med schools (and to finance that education).  I\u2019d suggest you research that further before embarking on that path.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SwimDad99</b><br><br>@CCThunderfin \u2013 Sounds like you\u2019ve got this all well in hand. Yes, my son is a swimmer at Williams and loves it. Of the NESCAC schools we visited, I liked all of them \u2013 Williams, Amherst, Middlebury, and Bowdoin. The coaches were terrific at each school. We really liked Swarthmore, too, and the new coach there, Karin Colby, was terrific. But we shied away from Swarthmore for the same reason you mentioned \u2013 the academic environment seemed a bit intense. Of course, Williams and Amherst are pretty intense, too, but Swarthmore does have a special reputation in that regard. My sense is that Harvey Mudd shares that reputation.<br>It sounds like you\u2019ve gotten the assurances you need at HM \u2013 that your odds of admission are very good. But, as for Engineering, my own personal experience is that there is no undergraduate major more intense. Those who choose that major learn a lot, get a strong degree, and find work. But they don\u2019t have much fun in college. If you\u2019re shying away from Swarthmore because of its academic intensity, then I\u2019d suggest you keep in mind that an Engineering major at HM would be VERY intense \u2013 probably much more than most students at Swarthmore experience. Pre-med at Amherst would be intense but manageable. Of course, I\u2019m just \u201csome guy\u201d with an opinion, but I\u2019d encourage you to give this Engineering some additional thought. I\u2019ve had a dozen or more friends who attempted Engineering in college quickly move on to something else. Even our valedictorian was pulling very low grades at Notre Dame while attempting Engineering \u2013 moved on to something else after the first year and found success. And if you ran into trouble with Engineering at Harvey Mudd, I\u2019m not sure what your other options would be. One last plug \u2013 the NESCAC appears to be a terrific place to swim. And Amherst is a great college town, among the best in the US. If you do apply to Amherst, there\u2019s no harm in reaching out to Rueppel and asking if he would support you for EDII.<br>As for whether to attend a top school for med school, you\u2019ll get lots of opinions here on CC. Some suggest that it doesn\u2019t matter AT ALL where you go \u2013 so long as you have the GPA and the MCAT scores. My sense is that these elite LACs are great places to go pre-med. And if you succeed, you\u2019ll have your pick of top medical schools. And if you don\u2019t succeed \u2013 or simply change your major as a great many do \u2013 you\u2019ll still graduate from one of the top colleges in the country (with a terrific education), and you\u2019ll have wonderful options going forward.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tenniswimvball</b><br><br>Re: Post 10, although HM is not interested in sports, the teams are a combination of HM, CMC, and Scripps.
