What I see too often is the college bound kids prioritizing name brand and prestige before quality as their decision making. The truly smart ones among them would choose Princeton for undergrad (or Williams and other great LAC's that offer quality undergrad education, for that matter) and then Stanford (or other \"prestigious\" universities) for grad program.

Financial aid does enter into the equation but when we are talking about HYPS the financial aid differences are bound to be negligible and each school tends to match the FA given by another.<br><br>@CA94309 Harvard benefits because it has the strongest brand name of any institution in higher education and a very long history of being perceived as the ultimate dream school. Stanford benefits because it is quickly approaching Harvard in brand prominence, is at least equally as strong or better in all fields, but it has a cooler/hipper brand and is seen as the future and something different from Harvard.

About two or three decades ago, I remember, whenever Harvard loses in an athletic event, the students would yell at the opposing team, \"it's okay, you'll work for us when you graduate\" or something to that effect. Harvard, being dismayed at such asinine attitude displayed by its students, put a stop to that and rightfully so. Fast forward to today, it's the Stanford students who are more likely to display such attitude than any other colleges nowadays. I also remember receiving a copy of Harvard Magazine about two decades ago that featured all the failed Harvard graduates, those who ended up driving taxi cabs and high rise window washers in NY and other cities after graduation. The point is you can go to whatever college you think is the BEST of them all and don't amount to much, or become the next Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Barack Obama, or whatever.

Reputations, USNWR rankings, and such seep into their consciousness like ivy. Having said that, though, we've had some quality discussions on what's best for him from all different angles, from his choice of study to his long-term goal.

I don't think that the quality of student fundamentally changes the quality of education provided by the school. Academic quality is primarily a function of teaching quality, class size (though it's more of a factor to some than others...), research opportunities in applicable fields, close academic contact with professors, and academic resources available. You might say that smarter students will improve the quality of classroom discussion and academic output, but again, they are paying to be taught. The onus is on the school to teach them, not vice-versa.<br><br>Obviously HYPSM are of roughly equal quality regarding students, teachers and resources.

While I was there, most of my classmates were from HYP, Berkeley, and Stanford. While they all had the finest minds, one of the biggest impressions that I had at the time was how humble those students from HYP were. One student, in particular, stood out from the crowd. While I was busy playing ping pong after dinner at the International House at Berkeley, I'd see him walking across from us with his violin case and going into the sound-proof, music practice room that was adjacent to the recreation room. I think he was younger than me, but I was his secret admirer. He comported himself with class, with humility, with a self-defacing air about him. He just went about his business; I didn't see him mixing with the crowd, but he always looked content and happy. I learned from the I-House booklet that he graduated from Princeton. I told myself, at the time, that when I eventually get married, I'd like to have a son like him. At the time, ironically, I had NO IDEA that my son is now headed to Princeton.<br><br>I then went on to a grad school at Harvard. There, too, I didn't come across anyone who I'd label as arrogant or a braggart. All the students I met either at my grad school or at the undergrad events, never did I ever feel a sense of shame like I do with certain folks on this forum. They all comported themselves with a sense of quiet confidence yet without the inferiority complex mixed with a tint of the Icarus Complex. People who possess true confidence with themselves and comfortable with who they're don't go around trying to prove everywhere that they're better than others.<br><br>A few decades later, when my son was applying to colleges, knowing that he was within the range of any top schools in the nation with the quantitative scores with the talent and EC's to go with, we had the decision to make as to which colleges to apply to. He was easily considered the top violinist in the state as he took all competitions that were available in the state. He secured the concertmaster position at the major city orchestra in the state, all-state, as well as the national level orchestra. He was accepted to all music camps in the nation that he applied to, including the prestigious Heifetz International Music Camp at the age of 14 and the Aspen Music Festival at the age of 16. Even though he had a very realistic shot at Juilliard or the New England Conservatory of Music, he didn't want to pursue music as a career, so we passed auditioning at any of them. I was happy, as I saved a bunch of money.<br><br>Perhaps because of the fact that I did earn a grad degree from Harvard, when time came to his college applications, his order of priorities was: Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Stanford, in that order, among the \"national\" universities and Williams, Pomona, and Amherst among LACs. He applied to 16 colleges in all, and this period was his most stressful time of his life applying to all these colleges while taking 8 most rigorous IB courses while, at the same time, preparing himself for the next concerto competitions, recitals, concerts, and auditions. He averaged about 4-5 hours of sleep a day during this time period. He slept when I was driving him to violin private lessons an hour away and he slept on the way back. When he began writing college application essays, he started with the ones that he desired the most, namely, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, Dartmouth, Williams, and down the list. He specifically targeted those colleges with a great music degree program or a great music performance opportunities with subsidized private instructions. Harvard (with NEC nearby), Princeton (with the Royal Conservatory of Music in London opportunity) and UPenn (with the Curtis Institute nearby) and Dartmouth (the only college with the \"Music Study Abroad Program\"), easily rose to my son's top target. In retrospect, I think my son got so exhausted with everything going on that he turned in lousy essays to all the rest of colleges that he considered a \"backup.\"<br><br>Interestingly, he got either waitlisted or rejected by those colleges he paid the least attention to with essays (including WashU of SL and Vanderbilt, both which he didn't even bother sending his music supplement) but accepted to those that he spent the most time carefully composing his essays. Essays, it turned out, are really important! Out of his top choices with the great music programs, he was accepted to all but Harvard, namely, Princeton, UPenn, Dartmouth, Williams, Amherst and Pomona. Although he was accepted to Duke, as well, it really didn't have the kind of music program that my son desired, so it didn't really have any significant role in the final decision making. While both my son and I respected Stanford, given my son's undergrad needs, it also didn't have much of a significance. In fact, my son only applied to Stanford because one of his best friends in high school practically begged him to. He wrote half-hearted lousy essays to Stanford, and that was that. Ultimately, what came down to was Princeton and Williams. As I've mentioned elsewhere, I was all for Willams simply because of my opinion that it offered the best undergrad education of any top colleges out there, including HYP and Stanford. Sure, it, unfortunately, lacked the recognition that it truly deserves, but I do know how to detect quality as opposed to hype. My son, on the other hand, chose Princeton. Knowing that I'm not the one who's going to college and also knowing that Princeton had the best reputation for undergrad education and focus among national universities, we reached a happy compromise.

Both schools are amazing with some of the brightest and most humble students and professors that my DC have encountered. I won't repeat what others have written, but some things to considered about Princeton vs. Stanford are: semester system vs. quarter system (depth of study vs. taking 1/3 more classes w/the quarter system - lends itself to more interdisciplinary studies); undergraduate focus with 2/3 undergrad &amp; 1/3 grad students vs. 1/3 undergrad &amp; 2/3 grad students which provides more grad courses available for undergrads; 4 seasons climate vs. basically 2 season climate; smaller suburban campus w/gentle hills and walkable vs. expansive campus (bikes everywhere); traditional, studious, and quiet campus vs. contemporary, active, and busy campus (Stanford has LOTS of events and conferences happening every day); grades focus in a post-grade deflation class environment vs. less grades focus (though still important) - leans more towards grade inflation; quite scholarly &amp; theoretical (adding to knowledge) with more traditional opportunities for application vs. scholarly &amp; theoretical with lots of opportunities to apply knowledge in Silicon Valley, industry, NGO's (it is not uncommon for Stanford students to take a quarter or more off to travel or work/intern,); required Junior Paper and Senior thesis vs. optional Senior thesis. IMO, Princeton seems to be more serious and purposeful in tone (east coast culture?) versus Stanford has a fun and even wacky tone at times (notice Stanford's band) that has fueled the entrepreneurial and innovation school spirit. The campus vibes and culture are different at each school but the caliber of the people are similar. Both schools have an extensive and active alumni network but Princeton is famous for its annual reunions where alumni can return every year instead of every five years. Besides these comparisons and your area of academic interest, do check out the extracurricular activities that each school offers.

Let's look at the numbers.<br><br>Stanford and Princeton admitted 2,050 and 1,890 students respectively this year. We'll assume you're right and Stanford wins 75% of its cross-admits with Princeton (Parchment suggests it's 66-78% at a 95% confidence interval, but whatever). The question is: how many students were actually cross-admitted?<br><br>I'm going to guess maybe 500, and likely far fewer, after you knock out the athletes, legacies and other hooked candidates particular to each of the two schools, and adjust for the fact that many kids won't apply to Stanford or Princeton because they prefer the other coast, they don't like something about one of the two schools, they got in early to one and didn't apply anywhere else, or for any other reason. As well, it goes without saying that some number of students are admitted to Stanford and denied by Princeton, and vice versa. They've both got single-digit admit rates and non-identical institutional needs and preferences, and having 30-40k applicants increases the randomness inherent in the process, so many applicants won't get into both.<br><br>Accordingly, out of the 500 overlapping students, we can assume that maybe 350 went to Stanford and 150 went to Princeton, for a net difference of 200 - and Stanford and Princeton have class sizes of roughly 1,525 and 1,350 students respectively. So what you're saying is that because roughly one out of seven Princeton students is supposedly taking the place of someone Princeton would rather have had but went to Stanford, for any number of reasons, Princeton has lower-quality students and inferior talent relative to Stanford.

I wrote a pretty extensive post the other day reasoning back from the disclosed numbers of students in the various subgroups actually enrolled at HYPSM, and taking account of the Stanford faculty senate numbers on cross-admits (which I have some questions about, but whatever), to try to understand how these schools could have similar admissions processes but also high yields and relatively small numbers of cross-admits; you can find it here (see also my follow-up post below it): <url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/discussion/comment/20623381/#Comment_20623381</url><br><br>S and H each year admit about 2,000 applicants and expect to lose 20% of them, principally to YPM but also to a wide variety of LACs, state schools, specialized programs at other top-twenty unis, etc. I believe only a small minority of students are admitted for sheer brilliance, and therefore that those most likely to be cross-admitted are a mix of high-performing URMs, athletes and other kids with particular attributes that make them institutional priorities (which might be anything from being the President's daughter to being a published author to being the star student in an underrepresented state to being the child of a fabulously wealthy oligarch, and any number of other things), plus some number of kids with interesting personal stories (e.g., the quadruplets who were on the Today Show the other day, all of whom were cross-admitted to H and Y and at least one of whom was also cross-admitted to S). And then, of course, there are some who are great students and leaders, who wrote essays and got recommendations that impressed more than one of HYPSM.<br><br>Also, bear in mind that each school admits many kids who fail to get into any of the other schools, either because they don't apply there or they're denied. Maybe one year only one school needs a tympanist (who is therefore denied at the other schools), or maybe that S legacy didn't make the cut at HYPM. Or maybe that kid who got in early to H called it a day and didn't submit any other applications.<br><br>So let's say 200 kids are cross-admitted to H and S, and many or most of them come from the groups I cited above. If 120 of them go to S and 80 of them go to H, as opposed to 110 and 90, or 100 each, does anyone really believe that it affects either school to a significant degree? Particularly when a lot of them are choosing on the basis of geography? And, big-picture, when each of these schools is admitting 2,000 kids per year, 80% of whom are going to accept their offers and only 10% of whom are cross-admits with the other school in the first place? I don't.<br><br>So, to return to my restaurant analogy, the largest group of Stan's customers come from the western part of the city, while most of the customers of Harry's, Yvonne's and Peter's come from the eastern part. All the customers of all the restaurants are either very diligent in speed-dialing to get their reservations, or they're preferred customers known to the maitre d'. As groups, everyone in any one of the restaurants is very similar to everyone in any one of the others. They're all very much the same kind of people, in other words, but a lot of them greatly prefer to eat in their local restaurant, or are partial to some dish that they believe is prepared best in one of the restaurants. Some of them are willing to drive across town to go to their preferred place.<br><br>A small number of them get reservations at multiple places and choose among them. If many people were getting multiple reservations, and everyone were choosing Stan's, then Harry's, Yvonne's and Peter's would have a problem that could affect their business. People would say that the crowd was much better at Stan's, and there could be a cascade effect wherein all the devotees of the restaurants in the eastern part of town would try to defect to Stan's. Nothing like that is happening, though - there are lines out the door, the food's great and the conversation is sparkling everywhere.<br><br>In conclusion, I hope the management of Stan's, cheered by the number of reservation requests, doesn't get complacent and start under-investing in food, decor and chefs. They may not fully realize how fortunate they are to be the only great restaurant in their neighborhood. Also, the other restaurants prepare many kinds of excellent food, and are working hard to raise their seafood game...<br><br>", "<b>Username: TiggerDad</b><br><br>\"If 120 of them go to S and 80 of them go to H, as opposed to 110 and 90, or 100 each, does anyone really believe that it affects either school to a significant degree?\"<br><br>The answer is, of course, no. But I'd even go further by asking the question: if any of HYPSM suddenly lost the entire class of 2021 just admitted due to an alien kidnapping or whatever, would it have truly lost something by replacing the original class with the next batch of student body given today's depth of outstanding applicants knocking on its gates of entrance?<br><br>", "<b>Username: ewho</b><br><br>@DeepBlue86 I am a badger with previous life in the mountains in China.<br><br>One day on a mountain, there were two monks trying to cross a river.
