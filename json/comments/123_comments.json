I\u2019ve begun combing through the websites, looking at course catalogs, internships, study abroad opportunities, etc. Kenyon (no surprise here) offers an extensive list of creative writing classes, while Colby, though offering some (I sat in on one during my visit), certainly appears to offer many fewer. Much appreciated advice!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: capaldifan</b><br><br>Both are absolutely amazing schools, so I can understand why this decision is a difficult one for you.  Both are on my daughter\u2019s list as well, and she will be applying ED2 to Colby if she doesn\u2019t get into her top choice (Bowdoin).  She ranked Colby ahead of Kenyon for some of the same reasons other posters have mentioned: slightly bigger student body, Jan term, and new athletic center.  She was also impressed by their career counseling department - they have a very dedicated alumni network which is great for internships, etc. She also liked that Colby is looking to strengthen it\u2019s  relationship with the town of Waterville, so some great things are happening there.  In the end, I think it was about \u201cvibe\u201d for her - she liked the outdoorsy, athletic vibe at Colby a bit more than the creative vibe at Kenyon (but as I said, she loved both schools). You really can\u2019t go wrong either way!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>These colleges are more similar than they are different and you won\u2019t go wrong at either one. Kenyon is known for having excellent English and creative writing classes. It\u2019s professors get consistently high marks. The campus is renowned for its beauty, though Colby has the views. Colby\u2019s Jan Plan is a bonus. It\u2019s a shame Kenyon doesn\u2019t offer something similar. Both colleges get an A+ on Niche.<br>I agree that Kenyon has a somewhat more creative vibe and Colby has a more outdoorsy vibe. Personally, as I only have my daughter\u2019s perspective, I would go for Kenyon over Colby. She applied to Kenyon and was accepted. She didn\u2019t apply to Colby because she felt it was a little too preppy for her.<br>If it makes any difference, Kenyon might have a little more name recognition nationally than Colby, if for no other reason than a US president attended. Consider also potential future jobs.

Kenyon had about 3 wheels and tiny, narrow space squeezed into a community arts space. My kid who was excited about continuing with ceramics in college as perhaps a studio arts minor was very disappointed in the ceramics opportunities at Kenyon.<br>\"\"<br><br>That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you so much. I will absolutely take that into my decision. Much appreciated!<br><br><br><br> doschicos:<br>\"\"<br>I\u2019m pretty sure Colby doesn\u2019t either. Many college fine arts programs don\u2019t. They have sculpture but not ceramics or wheelthrowing or many other areas of art that they deem more crafts oriented than \u201cfine art\u201d like weaving/textiles, woodworking, metalwork.<br>\"\"<br><br>Colby luckily has a 24-hour ceramics studio, and prides itself on its pottery club (they brag that for less than $30 a semester you get unlimited access to a metric ton of clay). The fact that either college has any pottery opportunities at all is great, but I\u2019m really astounded by Colby (hardly the first time I\u2019ve said that about either college).<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>For an extended perspective on Colby, you may want to search \u201cColby Life Documentary.\u201d<br>For Kenyon, though it\u2019s a fictionalized representation, you could watch Liberal Arts.<br><br>", "<b>Username: massmom2018</b><br><br>My son was rejected at Bowdoin and attends Colby.  We are in New England and Bowdoin is considered a harder admit here.  Colby has exceeded all expectations for my outdoorsy son.  Fantastic classes and community.  Good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: gardenstategal</b><br><br>I too consider Bowdoin a tougher admit.  But I also know several kids who got into Bowdoin but not Colby as well as kids who got into both and chose Colby.  And kids who got into Colby but not Bowdoin and who chose Bowdoin when admitted to both.  In many ways, very similar schools, and my guess is that most students at either would have been very happy at the other but there are some differences around the edges.  Post grad, the BBC (or CBB) alum seem  to recognize each other as kindred souls.<br><br>", "<b>Username: wisteria100</b><br><br>Colby\u2019s acceptance rate is so low in  part because it receives a ton of applications.  It gets more applications than most any other LAC.  They have done a great job of marketing and courting applications with fee waivers, outreach, test optional, no essay etc.  It\u2019s a great school, very strong academically, beautiful campus, but the acceptance rate can be construed as being in part manufactured<br><br>", "<b>Username: apple23</b><br><br>Steering away from the Colby/Bowdoin discussion and back to the original topic of this thread:<br>My daughter is a senior at Kenyon. She is an English major with a creative writing concentration, and a studio art minor.  The breadth and depth of offerings in the Kenyon English department, and of writing courses in particular, would be hard to match anywhere. The opportunities are so plentiful that even in four years one could not exhaust all possibilities.<br>There have been many mentions of Colby\u2019s new athletic center. Kenyon\u2019s athletic center is among the best of any LAC nationwide. Considering that you did not mention a particular interest in athletic centers, I wouldn\u2019t imagine this to be a deciding factor. Nonetheless, Kenyon\u2019s is spectacular. Kenyon will soon have a brand new library, which might be of more importance to you.<br>In light of the your interest in creative writing, I\u2019m curious as to how Colby made it into the final two given the colleges with stronger, national reputations in this area. (In the Northeast region, you\u2019d have choices such as Hamilton or Vassar that are more oriented toward this interest.) However, Colby would be excellent for the study of English literature in general (and therefore would probably be at least good for creative writing). This, combined with its emphasis on environmental initiatives, might make it a good choice. Even at that, though, you might find that it lacks Kenyon\u2019s artistic flair.<br><br>", "<b>Username: homerdog</b><br><br>@apple23 I agree with all of that. We met a creative writing major on one of our visits to Kenyon and learned a lot. Kenyon is such an amazing place for writers. And the athletic facilities are GORGEOUS. Probably the nicest we saw of all LACs we visited. I loved Kenyon. When we visited the second time, I went to a dinner with other parents and professors. I was impressed by everyone I met that night. Those profs love their job and are super impressive.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br><br><br><br> apple23:<br>\"\"<br>Kenyon\u2019s [atletic center] is spectacular.<br>\"\"<br><br>Yes.<br><br><br><br> homerdog:<br>\"\"<br>[Kenyon\u2019s] athletic facilities are GORGEOUS.<br>\"\"<br><br>And yes.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BigBlueSwim</b><br><br>My DS just faced the exact same decision for his ED1 application. Two outstanding liberal arts colleges with beautiful campuses.  Both have outstanding facilities, wonderful professors, and tight knit campus communities.  After initial summer campus tours and fall overnight visits he felt that they were both really great fits for him.  I think for him the new athletic facility and the Davis connects career center is what ultimately tipped the scale slightly in favor of Colby.  Either way you cannot go wrong.
