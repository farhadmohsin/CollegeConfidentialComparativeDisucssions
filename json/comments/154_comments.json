I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale\u2019s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being \u201cinexpensive\u201d for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend.<br>In the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers).<br>Many scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.<br><br>", "<b>Username: barrons</b><br><br>YOGO\u2013you only go once.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br><br><br><br> njdadjets:<br>\"\"<br>what I call the \u201cStevens Dilemma\u201d where a school like Stevens gives huge scholarship discounts to freshmen who fail to pull a 3.0 and thereafter lose that mo ru.<br>\"\"<br><br>Not sure why that would be a Stevens-specific issue.  Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).  But if the GPA minimum is something like 3.5, that can be more of an issue, since students have to protect their GPAs like pre-meds do.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Engineer80</b><br><br>It isn\u2019t an issue specific to any particular institution. As previously discussed, many scholarships (if not most) at many schools mandate that the recipient maintain a minimum GPA. Frequently, those conditions are imposed by the benefactor or funder of the scholarship. If the minimum GPA is not maintained, many will reduce or withdraw the scholarship. That is quite a common condition. The vast majority I am certain will state this or any other conditions that must be satisfied up front, and in those cases the student is made aware of his/her responsibilities up front. In my experience most schools are not in the business of \u201cbait and switch\u201d.<br><br>", "<b>Username: researchingmom19</b><br><br>@Engineer80 congrats on your engineering success. My son is considering Stevens for Bio and then plans to go to Medical school. I know their engineering program, job placement record and starting salaries are top. I\u2019m interested in information for students\u2019 experience in the bio/pre-med track. Thanks<br><br>"]}
