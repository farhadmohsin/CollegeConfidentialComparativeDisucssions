Last Freshman class was roughly 50% OOS. Secondly, while many public high schools in Michigan are not doing well, the ones that feed into Michigan are doing just fine. Second, Michigan receives $300 million from the state annually. While that is by no means enough on its own, when you combined it with its considerable endowment and the money Michigan generates from tuition thanks to its large OOS student body, the University is perfectly fine.<br>\u201cHistorically, U of M\u2019s advantages are their strong alumni base, its large endowment, and sports. However, sports seems to be sliding with the football team losing 12 out of the last 13 games to Ohio State and 8 out of the last 10 games to Michigan State.\u201d<br>What does football have to do with anything? Michigan is, first and foremost, one of the most intellectually supercharged communities in the country. Both Ann Arbor (which has the highest percentage of college education residents than any city in the US) and the University have an incredibly vibrant intellectual feel. Michigan is known for that. Michigan is also known for its very well rounded academic excellence. In fact, it is arguably the most well rounded academic institution in the country. Michigan is ranked among the top 15 in virtually every single field of study, and among the top 10 in most, including Business, Law and Medicine, as well as most traditional disciplines, such as English, History and Mathematics. In Anthropology, the Classics, Engineering, Philosophy, Political Science, Psychology and Sociology, Michigan is among the top 5 nationally. Michigan is also known as a medical center, and its hospital is considered one of the top 10 in the nation. So to suggest that Michigan is mostly known for football is a crude statement. That may be true of the uneducated masses, but then again, in those circles, most universities are not even recognized. But if you are insinuating that\u2019s Michigan\u2019s alumni are only loyal to the University if the football program is winning, you are mistaken. Michigan raised more from its alumni this year than it ever has. Michigan alumni are loyal to the university regardless of its football record.<br>But putting its record vs OSU and MSU aside, which is difficult considering how lopsided it has been, Michigan football is still doing well. It had back to back 10-3 seasons in 2015 and 2016, finishing #11 in the nation in 2015 and #10 in 2016. In 2015, two of Michigan\u2019s three losses were by 7 points or less, and they beat Florida 41-7 at the Citrus Bow. In 2016, Michigan lost 13-14 at Iowa, 27-30 in double overtime at OSU and 32-33 against Florida State at the Orange Bowl. 9 of Michigan\u2019s 10 wins in 2016 were by 9 points or more This year was supposed to be a rebuilding year, with 11 players drafted by the NFL last year. Still, the team is 4-1 (including a 33-17 win against Florida) and ranked #17 in the nation. Its four wins were all by a 16 point margin or better. While Michigan is struggling on offense this year, the Defense is ranked #1 in the nation. Another 10-3, top 10 season is certainly possible. Michigan also recruited back to back top 10 classes. I would say the future of Michigan football is looking good.<br>\u201cGiven their situation, I don\u2019t see how they can improve their undergrad situation significantly unless the State allows them to go private, which I think is unlikely.\u201d<br>Michigan\u2019s situation is good. The University is in very high demand as is evidenced by the annual increase in its applicant pool and 45% yield rate despite not enjoying the benefits of Early Decision admissions. Its endowment is one of the largest and growing by a healthy margin. The alumni are very loyal. Ann Arbor is a very nice college town.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\"This is fact, not opinion, state colleges are woefully underfunded by states and not allowed to raise in-state tuition, so they increase the student body size.

But we are not discussing public universities on this thread. This thread is about Michigan. Michigan is not hurting. Financially, Michigan is doing very well. The University\u2019s endowment has at the fastest pace of any university in the nation between 1990 and today. In 1989, Michigan\u2019s endowment was not even among the top 30 in the nation. Today, it is the 8th largest. In 2009, in the midst of the financial meltdown, Michigan spent $100 million to buy Pfizer\u2019s global research HQ campus, made up of some 25 buildings and over 2 million square feet of lab space. Naturally, all universities save HYPS can use more money, and Michigan is no exception, but Michigan is very well off\u2026as well off as Columbia.<br>To address your question, yes, I deny this. According to its CDS, Michigan\u2019s student body in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has indeed increased from 33,481 in 2007 to 38,076 in 2016. But the size of its instructional faculty in programs that enroll both undergraduate and graduate students has also increased from 2,063 in 2007 to 2,583 in 2016. The student to faculty ratio has remained steady at 15:1. So yes, I deny it, and I have the facts to prove it.<br>http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2007-2008_umaa.pdf  (Section I2)<br>http://obp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/pubdata/cds/cds_2016-2017_umaa.pdf (Section I2)<br>But tell me again, how do you justify Columbia\u2019s shameless claim that it has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when it omits 6,500 graduate students from its calculation? Oh, that\u2019s right, Columbia does not publish a CDS report. In fact, it is the only Ivy League institution that doesn\u2019t. But one thing is clear, Columbia is omitting 6,500 graduate students from its student to faculty ratio and that puts into serious question its ethical practices, as well a the integrity of the data it publishes. Columbia\u2019s actual student to faculty ratio would likely double if it were being honest, and its ratio would be 12:1 rather than 6:1. But that would mean a drop in the rankings, so obviously, Columbia and its private peers have little incentive to be honest. And what of the very flawed rankings methodology? Do you deny that private universities are gaming the rankings and that the methodology is seriously flawed?<br><br>", "<b>Username: CU123</b><br><br>Except Michigan has ~ 45,000 students of which 28000 are undergrads, compared to 31000 at Columbia of which 6000 are undergrads.

I have shown how many Michigan graduates are placed in major tech firms, and I even provided comparative data from Penn. Sadly, Columbia does not publish such data.

According to the US News Peer Assessment score, Columbia\u2019s rating hovers between 4.6 and 4.7, while Michigan\u2019s hovers between 4.4 and 4.5. That makes them peers in the eyes of university presidents, deans of undergraduate colleges and provosts. And how do you prove that Columbia has a 6:1 student to faculty ratio when Fu has a 25:1 ratio and the 4,500 College students share their faculty with 3,500 Graduate School of the Arts and Sciences?

For example, according to Penn\u2019s report, close to 60% of Penn graduates took jobs in the Mid Atlantic (DC to NYC) and Northeast (mostly Boston). In the case of Michigan (and Northwestern), approximately 50% work in the Midwest. The cost of living in the Midwest is significantly  lower than the cost of living in cities like DC, NYC and Boston, and the starting salaries will usually reflect the cost of living. Since 50%-60% of the graduates work and live regionally, it stands to reason that those take jobs in the most expensive region will have higher starting salaries.

Shaw, Drop Box, Palantir, etc.<br>I think the better job depends on many factors: the specific duties, compensation, location, etc.\"<br>Much2learn, I agree that other companies may offer more appealing alternatives, although I am not sure that those companies are hiring any fewer Michigan graduates vis-a-vis graduates from other top universities. For example, Michigan grads still do better with some of those secondary companies you mentioned, including Facebook, which hired more Michigan grads (12) than Cornell (fewer than 5) and Penn (2).<br>Location, as you point our, plays a major role here. That is why many graduates end up working in their respective regions. It is difficult for many graduates from schools like Michigan and Northwestern to accept jobs on the West Coast or East Cost because that would mean going far from home. Many would rather take good jobs locally, or regionally.<br>That being said, I do not think the pay gap is sufficient to make any assumptions or draw any conclusions. The Michigan average starting pay for a CS major is $94,000, vs $101,000 for a Penn CS major. That $7k gap could well be explained by a variety of reasons/factors, including regional pay differences and relative differences in variable pay (stock options etc\u2026).<br><br>", "<b>Username: theloniusmonk</b><br><br>One more thing that sets salaries, how well you can negotiate, I wish I had known that when I just got out of school.
