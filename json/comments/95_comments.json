I'm not saying endowment size makes a huge difference, I'm just saying that Harvard's larger endowment is spread more thin, and you should be aware of the fact that Harvard devotes a lot more time and energy to its grad programs, meaning that while it has more raw money, a lot less of it goes to undergrad students. I'd say Princeton in economics, engineering, mathematics, and science has a very, very small edge on Harvard. And Yale for that matter. However not nearly a great enough edge to warrant choosing Princeton over H or Y should you prefer something intangible about H or Y.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jomjom</b><br><br>\"\" Harvard's larger endowment is spread more thin, and you should be aware of the fact that Harvard devotes a lot more time and energy to its grad programs, .....\"\"<br><br>Most of Harvard's endowment is concentrated on Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Undergrad) and its Per capita endowment a lot bigger than Princeton's. Many of Harvard Grad endowments are not that high, HBS, HLS, HMS has only about 1-2 billion each.

I would ignore the above poster's claim that Princeton is not as good at math as Harvard. The Putnam is a very narrow way to judge the math department. Princeton has one of the best math departments in the world, so if you are interested in physics or math, you should absolutely consider Princeton; moreover, many math and physics majors drop math to go into engineering. In this case, you would be better served by Princeton's engineering department than by Harvard's, which is relatively weak.<br><br>With all that said, I would not recommend Princeton over Harvard--at least not unequivocally. In retrospect, I might even have gone to Harvard. I think the Princeton administration is taking every wrong step, and in the upcoming four years, the university will not remain as strong as it used to be. Hear are some things you should keep in mind:<br><br>1) The collapse of the financial market will hurt Princeton more than Harvard, since we sent a greater proportion of our kids to Wall Street (alumni donations!). The career services center is geared toward people interested in finance and law school (and of course medical school, but that is a completely different route). While we do have strong alumni representation in many areas, our career services office is not well-equipped to connect us to alumni in Hollywood, Academia, Sports, etc. Although students should certainly be proactive in seeking out alumni, it is much easier with a career office to guide you.<br><br>2) Grade deflation will hurt Princeton. Students have always complained about grade deflation, but this is not just some minor annoyance. A recent article in the Daily Princetonian, <a href=\"http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/03/25/23135/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Some graduate schools, employers still unfamiliar with grade deflation policy - The Daily Princetonian</a> elaborates on some problems I have seen. Read the comments section. It will be elucidating.<br><br>3) While Princeton currently has a better social scene than Harvard, I'm not sure how long this will last. With the growth of residential colleges, people who do not go to the eating clubs often live separately from everyone else. This could be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for, but I have found that it further alienates people who were not as attuned to the social scene here to begin with (not that there is anything wrong with that).<br><br>4) Princeton may soon see more political activism than Harvard. At least, I can tell that over my four years here, there have been more protests/complaints/anger than before. Maybe this is because of grade deflation, or maybe this is because polarizing political events. Either way, this could be interesting.<br><br>5) Based on my experience, the Princeton alumni network is really strong. I see a huge difference between the way alumni share their time with Princetonians, and the way the administration here--Dean Malkiel specifically--is detached from student affairs.<br><br>6) Everything listed above--about statistics, name recognition, etc.--should be taken into consideration, but only lightly. If you do have the opportunity to choose between these two schools, please don't base it on which one is marginally more prestigious. In retrospect, the prestige matters very little when you are choosing among the top echelon of schools (Harvard, Princeton, Yale, MIT, Stanford, Cal-Tech). I think it's remarkably petty to argue that any one of these schools is better--\"overall\"--than the others. I think that all one could say about them is that they are different, and their character may serve different personalities better than others.<br><br>", "<b>Username: cpenoi</b><br><br>I always say about Princetonians that they are polite and don't drink the koolaide. So when asked to confirm a commonplace about the school, they will gravely state a disclaimer, and in doing so reveal a smallness about their views, a self preoccupation. Their fellows will not point this out to them, however, as they are too polite to do so. So, discussion is not as robust as it might be at old Nassau. Unique and exceptional qualities of Princeton are almost never mentioned on this forum by Princetonians. For example, the P-rade at reunions is so much the most incredible instance of social continuity and intergenerational support at a college that the mind can barely comprehend it. Former Secretaries of State and Nobel prize winners march in it with enthusiasm. Yet I have never heard a single Princenian express any special admiration for it lasting over 4 seconds. It is a wonderful place. Just don't expect to learn very much about it from listening to the people who have gone there.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mustafah78</b><br><br>Very informative post, PolPHD.

This is not the case. There were 4,297 offers of admission by Harvard and Princeton combined last year. The maximum number of students who could have been offered admission to both institutions was 1,396, which would mean that approximately 2/3 of students could have been offered admission to both schools. However, some educated guesswork suggests that the actual number was between 400 and 800 students who were offered admission to both institutions. If we take the higher number of 800, which is probably too high, that would still mean that fewer than 40% of the students who were offered admission to Harvard and/or Princeton last year were offered admission to both institutions.

Pick the school that suits you better; most alumni will tell you that student life ultimately becomes more important than any numbers or statistics. Honestly, I don't care if a university gets 100% of its students into top graduate schools if the student life is absolute hell. Also, its not the university that holds you back from graduate school.

The way I brain it, even if you go to Harvard because the highly arbitrary rankings deem it \"better\" than Princeton, if you were really a Princeton person, you're not going to perform at the level you could have had you gone to Princeton.

But I think Byerly's English was better...<br><br>", "<b>Username: PtonGrad2000</b><br><br>Danas, I believe I remember your saying that you did your undergrad work at Harvard. Isn't that correct? I've appreciated your thoughtful and rational comments on these boards.<br><br>", "<b>Username: danas</b><br><br>Just for a term. Long enough to know it is an amazing place, as advertised.<br>I'm very happy my daughter chose Princeton, though, for reasons having to do with the undergraduate social experience and access to faculty. I got my graduate degree at the University of Chicago and work there now. A great institution, but not strong on either social experience or access to faculty, at least for undergraduates. I guess I'm glad my daughter chose the \"not U of C\".<br><br>", "<b>Username: cornfed</b><br><br>A friend of my d who ended up at Yale(he dn apply to Princeton) just refused to attend Harvard as an undergraduate despite the fact his family had attended for generations.While he never addressed his reasons why friends of his family found out his mother was displeased by the sink or swim attitude displayed towards undergraduates(including his sister who had just graduated the year before he applied).<br><br>The number one thing our daughter appreciates is the social atmosphere at Princeton. She's not interested in eating clubs yet found that in no way has limited her friendships.She has four classes this semester and three have under 30 kids in them - she's a sophomore.She'll have her first huge class in the fall, Psychology, to satisfy a science requirement.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alumother</b><br><br>Same thing in my family. My middle sister and brother went to Harvard and found it too competitive. Not like cutthroat people hurting eachother. Just that the type of people it attracts thrive on competition vs. thriving on belonging. I went to Princeton and loved it even though I didn't fit the social profile at the time. So, my kids are at Princeton. Even my little sister says that's where she wants her kids to go....<br><br>", "<b>Username: Code H</b><br><br>BUMP! this is important :)<br><br>", "<b>Username: Cookster</b><br><br>If I were accepted at both I'd go to Harvard, just because it's Harvard. If I didn't got to Harvard I'd still be elated to attend Princeton.<br><br>", "<b>Username: xAAAx</b><br><br>I'm not even applying to Harvard...<br><br>", "<b>Username: vivaldifanafb</b><br><br>I agree with jomjom, Harvard is the best in the world. Princeton does have a very good music program (so I have heard, one that allows you to major in music while you are majoring in something else), but Harvard has much more to offer and is more well known throughout the world.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Baelor</b><br><br>Harvard has much more to offer? Arguable. And world recognition does not equal quality.<br><br>You can argue the comparable quality of the two schools without dabbling in irrationality, so please do so. :)<br><br>", "<b>Username: jillianseymour36</b><br><br>Who gives a crap which school is better? If one school has a higher rank and then, because you have some need to augment your ego, go there for the prestige, then what do you gain? Just choose the school that is best suited for you and stop worrying about which one will sound more impressive.<br><br>", "<b>Username: natim1</b><br><br>jillianseymour36: you say that like it's so easy, \"Just choose the school that is best suited for you.\" Well, I visited both and have no freaking idea which is better for me. I'm leaning toward Princeton just bc the people I met there were cooler than the ppl I met at Harvard. But that's a dumb reason too, but it's all I got.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alumother</b><br><br>Actually, it's not a dumb reason if you met people who were cooler. Not when choosing between Princeton and Harvard. All else being equal, i.e., you don't NEED to be in Cambridge or Princeton Township, or you don't want to major in something unique that only one place or the other offers, choose the place where you felt comfortable. That stuff matters. The kids now feeling they like Yale or Stanford more than Princeton should go there. If you liked Princeton more, that's where you should go. I'm a Princeton alum. My sister and brother went to Harvard. Turns out we all like Princeton more. Nothing against Harvard, it's just a temperament thing.<br><br>", "<b>Username: natim1</b><br><br>but i don't doubt that there are cool poeple at harvard, I just wasn't able to meet them. Is my reasoning still good? Should I still go to Princeton?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alumother</b><br><br>Put it this way. Why NOT go to Princeton? Remind me, what do you want to major in? And then, how do you feel about suburbs vs. cities, and how much do you like to fight? Then I will apply the eHarmony college match algorithm:). Seriously.<br><br>", "<b>Username: natim1</b><br><br>I like cities more than suburbs. I was entirely put off by the city of Princeton. But, I console myself with the idea that I don't ever need to leave campus. I want to major in economics, but maybe premed as well. I want to go somewhere where I can do anything and everything and be successful. I'm 17 and don't really know waht I love to do yet. Why NOT Princeton? Princeton, NJ. Fighting? hmmm. Well, I'm not much for initiating competition with others, but I never back down from a fight....<br><br>", "<b>Username: JohnAdams12</b><br><br>cornfed, won't psychology also have a precept or two a week with less than 20 students?<br><br>\"\"She'll have her first huge class in the fall, Psychology, to satisfy a science requirement\"\"<br><br>", "<b>Username: JohnAdams12</b><br><br>People don't realize how truthful this statement is at Princeton.<br><br>\"\"But, I console myself with the idea that I don't ever need to leave campus.\"\"<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alumother</b><br><br>If you prefer cities, and you never back down from a fight, I'd say you might be happier at Harvard.<br><br>", "<b>Username: poste3</b><br><br>Havard, no question<br><br>", "<b>Username: Gmanman</b><br><br>Harvard is the best school on this planet.<br><br>Harvard >>> MIT,Yale >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Stanfrod >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> who cares<br><br>", "<b>Username: Wildwood11</b><br><br>Gmanman, if you are so into Harvard, why are all your posts to date on the Princeton forum? What makes you so obsessed with proclaiming Princeton's inferiority? Are you the same poster that has appeared previously in other forms? Jom Jom? German_car? I really feel sorry for you as you seem to need to spend so much time disparaging a particular school? You should seek help.<br><br>", "<b>Username: cornfed</b><br><br>Yes it does but her major is in a small department so she never had a large lecture class before psychology.<br><br>"]}
