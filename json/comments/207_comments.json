My interests are mathematics, computer science, and finance, and I hope to maybe become a quantitative analyst one day.<br>At Cornell I would probably major in mathematics with a concentration in operations research, while at Ross I would get a bachelor\u2019s in business administration with maybe a minor in mathematics. I was wondering which school would have better placement on Wall Street, but I also was wondering which college would have the more enjoyable experience.<br>Any help would be appreciated.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>@soymilk23 If it was any other ivy i would say the ivy without thinking about it, but I would take a moment to think more about Cornell vs Ross. in the end i would still say Cornell though. Cornell has extremely good placement on Wall-Street and it is more of a target school than UMich Ross. Also you will probably get a better overall education. UMich is a phenomenal school but I wouldn\u2019t really choose it over the ivies for your areas interest.  Unless of course there is a substantial financial aid difference or sth major like that, in which case UMich is an excellent choice over any ivy.<br><br>", "<b>Username: soymilk23</b><br><br>@Penn95 Thanks for your input. I haven\u2019t received my financial aid from Cornell yet, but I got absolutely nothing except for a couple thousand dollars in loans from Michigan since I\u2019m out of state. Since Cornell says they meet financial need I would expect to get a decent amount.<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>Wait for the financial package from Cornell to come in \u2013 it may make the answer obvious.<br><br>", "<b>Username: soymilk23</b><br><br>Does anyone have any input on aspects of social life at either university? A big reason why I\u2019m still considering Michigan is because of the reputation of Ann Arbor as a great college town and Michigan\u2019s amazing sports culture.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>That is true. Ann Arbor is a great college town and UMich has a great social culture. Cornell is one of the more social ivies, and the campus is gorgeous. I would say Ann Arbor is a nicer town than Ithaca.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hogwarts2021</b><br><br>Hi @soymilk23, I can\u2019t speak to the social life at Cornell, but I can tell you alllll about Ann Arbor. I don\u2019t go to UM (yet?), but I live in A2, and yes, it is everything it is cracked up to be. UM is integrated seamlessly into the town, so you\u2019re really becoming part of both communities when you go to UM. The sports are pretty epic, and that makes students very proud of their school. I would say that UM offers a very well-rounded college experience, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. However, I know pretty much nothing about Cornell, so I can\u2019t compare.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rjkofnovi</b><br><br>Ross over Cornell A&S.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>Both can get you where you want to go, so it really comes down to finances and fit.<br>If there isn\u2019t a big monetary difference, try to visit both if you can.<br><br>", "<b>Username: soymilk23</b><br><br>@rjkofnovi Can you give me some reasons why you think so?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>I am an alumnus of both Cornell and Michigan.

I was thinking about doing that but I don\u2019t want to be overwhelmed with work.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>It is manageable, but depending in how many AP credits Michigan grants you, it could require (1) extra effort on your part and/or (2) an extra semester to graduate.<br><br>", "<b>Username: harvard_and_berkeley</b><br><br>Wait until you get the financial aid offers\u2026 if one is substantially cheaper, go there.<br>If they are comparable in cost, go visit and go with your gut.<br>I don\u2019t think either will unlock more doors than the other for your future career (and dispute the notion that somehow Cornell is more sought on Wall Street than Michigan.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: yorkie97</b><br><br>ross has amazing computer science programs and opportunities, paired with ross BBA and an amazing college experience in ann arbor? take umich.<br><br>", "<b>Username: yorkie97</b><br><br>sorry meant to say umich** has great CS programs<br><br>", "<b>Username: Much2learn</b><br><br>@soymilk23 Either one can get you to Wall Street. I agree that cheaper is better, but I would lean toward Cornell. I like the Mathematics and Ops research though.<br>I would take at least a couple CS courses if you can fit it in. You don\u2019t need a minor, but a couple courses will help.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rjkofnovi</b><br><br>Did the OP get into Dyson?  Wouldn\u2019t  Ross have better connections to Wall Street than the liberal arts college at Cornell?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Coloradomama</b><br><br>soymilk27  a math major is different by far than a business major. Worry a lot more about do you really want a mathematics major at Cornell, and why not at Michigan?  Mathematics majors will require you to work hard. An undergraduate business degree is less valuable down the road,  in comparison,  unless you are taking a lot of quantitative classes.   At Michigan I take it you would take a lot of math though.       Do you want an MBA? Then the harder major of mathematics will go a long way if its paired with a great job option in NYC later, for a few years and then your application to Wharton etc.  Cornell is very tied to New York city and opening a new campus on Roosevelt Island , Cornell Tech.  Look into Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island. Its located at Google in NYC right now.    Its pretty far from the Ithaca campus, but looks interesting to me:<br>https://tech.cornell.edu/<br><br>", "<b>Username: brantly</b><br><br>I am very familiar with both schools, as I am an alum of one and I have a child at the other. Cornell Arts & Sciences and Michigan Ross will be VERY different experiences academically. Ross is very preprofessional. It\u2019s almost like an employee training program with some academics sprinkled in. If you double major with math, which is in LSA, you actually would be doing a dual degree, meaning that you would be graduating with a BBA from Ross and a BA (or BS?) in math.<br>At Cornell Arts & Sciences you\u2019d be taking a more traditional course of study. It also has a lot of distribution requirements.  My recommendation is to make a spread sheet of the exact classes you\u2019d have to take (or requirements you\u2019d have to fulfill) every year at each college. Which looks more interesting? Which one gets you more excited? That will make the decision for you (outside of the financial aspect).<br>Of course you can always go to Michigan and major in math there. You can minor in business at Ross if you want. There will be plenty of Wall St. opportunities with an undergrad math major.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>It would be easy to switch majors within CAS at Cornell. You likely can take any CAS major at UMich as well. Both are recruited.<br><br>", "<b>Username: blevine</b><br><br>Most important goal from OP \u201cI hope to maybe become a quantitative analyst one day.\u201d<br>Hands down, math and comp science over ANY b-school.<br>Finance degree from Ross would help you for other careers on wall street but NOT to be a true quant.<br>Quant teams hire math degrees, (and CS is pretty much like a math major), physics, engineers, operations research. Finance is a plus but not a substitute unless it\u2019s a quant focused degree as some b-schools have (not sure about Ross).<br>Also note, I have worked for 3 decades on the street.  My current employer\u2019s President and many execs are Cornell grads.   A past employer was founded by a Cornell grad (who was also a board member at Cornell). There was a comment at the top of the thread about \u201cif it was any other ivy\u201d\u2026 Ridiculous comment.<br>Cornell is VERY HEAVILY REPRESENTED on wall street in many many roles with many different types of degrees. That is totally incorrect the ivy comment.   In fact I have yet to meet a Brown graduate in my 3 decades on Wall Street.   Lots of Harvard and Penn, but honestly in a quant role people are most impressed by MIT and NONE of the ivies     Also note while there are MIch grads on wall street, there are far more Cornell grads in NYC and better<br>networking opportunities as a result.<br>A typical b-school degree will lead to very different career options than a math/cs focus regardless of the schools selected, so that should be the major deciding factor.   Ithaca is a wonderful college town, I doubt Ann Arbor has anything better to offer in day to day lifestyle than Ithaca, it is often voted one of the BEST college towns.<br>Full disclosure, I do have a son at Cornell and less familiar with Michigan, but I know the difference<br>between b-school and math/comp sci ( I studied comp sci/math/engineering myself and took some b-school classes as electives).  I worked in the quant and IT area of some of the largest best known banks and fund managers. I am a hiring manager and I would take the math/cs/ops research etc grad over any b-school grad in a quant role. If you wanted a different career path you can always later go get an MBA at a top b-school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\u201cHands down, math and comp science over ANY b-school. Finance degree from Ross would help you for other careers on wall street but NOT to be a true quant.\u201d<br>blevine, Ross requires 55 credits for the completion of the major. Students can take their remaining 65 credits in LSA, and double majoring in Pure Mathematics and Business is definitely possible. If the OP wishes to pursue a career in Quantitative Analysis, a double degree from LSA (Mathematics) and Ross (Business) would serve him/her well.<br>\u201cAlso note while there are MIch grads on wall street, there are far more Cornell grads in NYC and better<br>networking opportunities as a result.\u201d<br>I don\u2019t know about \u201cfar more\u201d. Obviously, Cornell is a NY institution, and 35% of its alumni are NY residents, so naturally, more of them will be working in NY. But Michigan is very well represented on Wall Street. I would definitely say that when it comes to IBanking placement, Ross matches Cornell.<br>\u201cIthaca is a wonderful college town, I doubt Ann Arbor has anything better to offer in day to day lifestyle than Ithaca, it is often voted one of the BEST college towns.\u201d<br>Did you actually visit Ann Arbor? I am an alum of both Cornell and Michigan. I lived in Ithaca for 2 years and Ann Arbor for 4 years. Ann Arbor has more to offer than Ithaca. Not just the city itself, but the surrounding areas as well.<br><br>", "<b>Username: monydad</b><br><br>@blevine, if you look closely you\u2019ll find that those rankings you\u2019ve seen are for college towns less than a certain population. Ann Arbor is larger so not part of that particular comparison.<br>I\u2019ve visited Ann Arbor a few times recently. And will be going there a few more times yet.<br>Ann Arbor\u2019s downtown is bigger than Ithaca\u2019s. and it is easier to walk to, because there is no huge hill separating it from the campus. To me it feels more suburban, whereas Ithaca is more hippy-ish. Ann Arbor is very convenient to the Detroit suburbs, if you live there. And to Detroit. I imagine students do get some value from Detroit, but to me large swathes of it look to be in shambles. Literally.<br>Ithaca is surrounded by fantastic state parks, and has a very \u201cchill\u201d vibe to it that is hard to match, IMO. The campus is also beautiful. I personally love it there. I take vacations there. Nearly every year. It is clearly more isolated, but most students find there is enough to do right there, most of the time. To get the most out of your time there, it is best to have a car during the upperclassman years. Or have a friend who has a car. That is not required, but it enables one to more fully experience Ithaca and the surrounding areas far from the campus. If you want to get away for a weekend,there are daily buses from campus to NYC, and boatloads of students who are from the area traveling in the vicinity all the time. But NYC is 4+ hours away.<br>The person I am visiting in Ann Arbor wanted met o go to a football game. Because it is such a big deal there. The irony is that this person hates sports and wouldn\u2019t apply to Cornell because it had too much sports.<br>There are certainly people at Cornell who go to all the football games. And, at least when I was there, were rabid about hockey. However a lot of people who attend Cornell would feel that this amount of obsession about sports is frankly retarded.So perhaps that\u2019s a point of campus culture distinction.<br>It\u2019s true that Cornell has a large alumni presence in and around NYC. The alumni club there is particularly active. Much moreso than those of our other alma maters. I\u2019ve attended a number of interesting lectures they\u2019ve sponsored.<br>I\u2019m far removed from Wall Street by now, but at least based on my framework in antiquity I would agree with @blevine\u2019s description. Except that, from what I saw, those quant jobs did not often go to people out of undergrad. Heck, the trading firm I worked for hired physics PhDs for those jobs. There\u2019s a lot of money involved they weren\u2019t messing around. Most of the undergrad hires I saw were  liberal arts majors from top schools.( Including Brown, BTW. Cornell too.)  And grads of business programs such as Wharton, NYU  and Ross. And also Cornell, even though at that time AEM was \u201cAg Ec\u201d and didn\u2019t have the reputation it has now.<br>Either way, to get a Wall Street job, in my day at least one would need to be exceptional. And \u201cfit\u201d. I suggest do not make your whole decision based on that. Besides after a year you might get turned on by psychology, or whatever, and completely change your objectives.<br>The new tech center in NYC is for grad programs. It is still in its infancy but I would not bank on it doing much for you, if I were you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: blevine</b><br><br>There was some assertion that somehow Cornell is a lesser ivy on Wall street.<br>Nothing to do with Michigan.   Cornell is very heavily represented at all levels,<br>buy side, sell side and many types of roles.<br>As far as only having PhDs, yes a dept head and other highly paid researchers would be PhDs. But they do hire undergrads to do their rather high end gruntwork.   From there with experience, yes one might want to go back to grad school for mba or PhD depending on longer term aspirations.  Those PhDs will hire stem majors over b-school. Yes if you dbl major in a stem field, even better, and either college would allow study of bus and stem.  I have also seen people with undergrad only, move to portfolio management, prop trading out from reseach.   Point is stem is the better foot in the door for an undergrad.  If you excel, maybe PhD is the next step.  If less so, maybe work experience then MBA.   STEM undergrad degrees are more rigorous than undergrad business, and that would open many more  doors.   I have heard from Penn Engineers that they take Wharton undergrad classes, as easy electives, compared to their engineering courses.<br>There was an assertion that Ithaca is not a good college town.  Yes it\u2019s small and isolated I agree, but a \u201ccollege town\u201d is small by definition.  Is Boston a \u201ccollege town\u201d ?   But there are many college students.   Not detracting from Michigan, but don\u2019t knock Ithaca, many LOVE it. Personal preference.  If you want big, you can\u2019t beat Boston as a college town, would take that over either.   But if you want an intimate college town, and love nature, hard to beat Ithaca.   Ann Arbor may be wonderful, but neither extreme.  Maybe a happy medium that would satisfy most.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>I agree 100% blevine. Cornell is extremely under appreciated on CC. There is no such thing as a \u201clesser Ivy\u201d. It is a contradiction in terms. All Ivies are excellent. But I object to the insinuation that Cornell is better than Michigan. Cornell was co-founded by a Michigan professor, and 7 of its 14 presidents were either Michigan alumni or Michigan faculty, including the incoming president, Martha Pollack, who is awesome by the way! The two universities are virtually identical when it comes to academic prowess, reputation, student quality, resources, etc\u2026<br>With regards to college towns, I do not deny Ithaca\u2019s charm. It is quaint, charming, safe, intellectual etc\u2026At no time did I mock\u2026or knock it. Ann Arbor is just a more complete college town. Small enough to be intimate, quaint and charming, but large enough to accommodate most types. The Detroit suburbs have much to offer as well, and having a large international airport 20 miles away makes life easier, especially for international students. I agree that for outdoorsy types, Ithaca is hard to beat though, but it is tiny, not easily accessible on foot, isolated, and very easily outgrown.<br><br>", "<b>Username: monydad</b><br><br>I didn\u2019t see Alexandre ( who, BTW is the most Super of Super Moderators; I believe he wears a cape, and a utility belt) assert that \u201cIthaca is not a good college town\u201d. And I certainly did not intend that either.<br>It\u2019s just that he clearly prefers Ann Arbor. Which he only pointed out in reaction to your post on the topic.  Having visited, I can understand why.<br>However I will continue to vacation in Ithaca, Not Ann Arbor.

Part of that is simply location and perpetuation through alumni networking.
