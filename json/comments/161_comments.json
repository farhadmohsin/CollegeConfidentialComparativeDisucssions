Yes 1800 students in one class.  I asked how large are junior EECS classes he said some are 600 students.  Upper classman classes with 600 students!  I thought this was insane.  Looks like S can graduate in 3 years at CMU.  We went over all of S AP\u2019s and grad student showed us how each AP will eliminate a class requirement.  We are verifying this with a CMU ECE advisor.  Grad student pointed out with taking just 8 more classes S can graduate with a master\u2019s in 4 years.  This sounds very appealing.<br>@suzyQ7  Yes, Amazon is coming to MD.  Reminded S.<br>@learning19   S received the Banneker Key scholarship at UMD.  There is also the Presidential scholarship.  Yes, out of state can get merit scholarships.  For the BK full ride you need to be about top 250.  Apply by Nov 1st and you will be considered for all scholarships.  We received notice around early Feb for the interview.  400 get the interview.  150 get the full tuition.  250 get the tuition/room/board/books.  S interview was late Feb.  Panel of 2 interviewed S.  S said they asked very insightful questions.  They had complete knowledge my S\u2019s application.  I heard you need to have wide variety of AP\u2019s not just in your area of interest.  For example, my S wants to study engineering.  Not only does he have lots of AP\u2019s in math and science but also in history and English.  Need perfect or close to perfect stats, strong EC\u2019s and solid essay.  There is a CC thread on BK.  Search: Banneker Key 2022 Discussion.  Good luck!<br>I think I have a slightly better understanding why S does not want to go to UMD.  At all the schools there are lots of group projects ie in lab break outs of engineering classes, senior project, Honors group project at UMD.  In those group projects S does NOT want to be the one carrying the project.  He hates being the one most interested.  He has had this complaint most of high school.  He has said several times throughout high school he does not like being the smartest student.  He wants to feel like he is in the middle of the pack not at the top.<br>S said even his smart friends who end up at UMD become unmotivated.  Program is too easy so they have lots of time playing computer games.  His friend at CMU is so busy because the work is very hard he has no time to play games.  All the students around him are motivated/driven and are not interested in playing games.  He says this is the type environment he wants to be in.<br>S has a teacher he highly respects (and I highly respect) at his high school.  I suggested meeting with this teacher this week and lay out all the options and listen carefully to what he says.<br>I have come to the conclusion I will not twist his arms and force UMD on him.  I do not want a bitter unhappy college student.  Fortunately, we are in the position he can go to the college he wants to (unfortunately this may mean he does not get JD/MBA later on).  Ironically, because we told S our only requirement in his college applications is that he must apply to UMD and then he received this scholarship we are in this predicament now.  Isn\u2019t life fun?<br>My dilemma:  As a parent is it my responsibility to listen to S and have confidence his knows what he wants or is it my responsibility to force what I believe is best for him and he will (hopefully) come around to see the logic 4 years from now.<br><br>", "<b>Username: suzyQ7</b><br><br>Thanks for the update!

(One was able to graduate a semester early, in fact.)<br>That said, given the choice between Cal and CMU at a similar price point, I totally see CMU as a rational option.
