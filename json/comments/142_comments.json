The audition for PUO tends to get more competitive every other year, because PUO tours a select country in Europe every other year, all expenses paid for by the school, so a greater display of interest in the touring year. This year, my son toured three cities in Spain, for example. There are several other groups that you can also participate in.

In terms of elitism, you will find a bit of that at each college but it definitely won\u2019t define your experience at any of them if you don\u2019t want it to. I would say to narrow it down, you can decide by fit and vibe. Princeton and Rice are more close-knit and have a more intellectual vibe, Duke also has droves of very intelligent kids but will have a different sense of community revolving around sports and a more fun student body. In terms of weather, Rice&gt;Duke&gt;Princeton if you like warmth and sun. In terms of overall happiness, probably Rice&gt;Duke&gt;Princeton as well. If you want to try something new, I would consider Princeton or Duke because you\u2019ll be in a newer area and a chance to try new things out for 4 years. The ability to have great opportunities from these schools are also quite comparable, although I would say Princeton and Duke probably open doors to the most exclusive opportunities that you might get overlooked for from Rice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ejc000</b><br><br>Hello, everyone! Just wanted to provide an update on my decision.<br>My visit to Princeton for Princeton Preview was nice. The people I met were friendly, the campus was absolutely stunning, and the performing arts groups were really fun to watch. It was definitely a positive experience.<br>My visit to Rice (immediately after Princeton) for Owl Days was also nice, if not even more nice. The students I met were incredibly outgoing and passionate about the school, the weather was great, and I even got to participate in some social activities with my older brother. I felt at home, and that I would fit in easily. Despite previously being very keen on Princeton, I came out of Owl Days nearly ready to commit to Rice.<br>The following week I flew up to NC for Blue Devil Days at Duke. Again, it was a nice visit. I hung out with some really fun students, saw a gorgeous campus, and got a glimpse of the amazing things happening at Duke. That being said, the visit didn\u2019t wow me enough to justify going there (after all, Duke was the most expensive of the three!). After this visit I declined Duke and started deciding between Rice and Princeton.<br>Deciding was one of the hardest things I\u2019ve done in a while. Over the course of several days, I flip flopped between Rice and Princeton extremely often. Sometimes my opinion even changed multiple times during the course of a day.<br>Basically, my decision came down to my consideration of the opportunities and social life at the two schools. While Rice felt like a better fit when I was on campus, I eventually deduced that this was likely a result of my familiarity with the campus, and the fact that I got to go around with my brother and check out a party. After talking to friends, teachers, and Princeton students, I felt confident that I would be able to find my people at Princeton through extracurriculars and my residential college, even if the environment wouldn\u2019t be as laid back as Rice\u2019s.<br>As far as opportunities, I decided that Princeton was more catered to what I want out of my college experience. While Rice has a decent non-major symphony orchestra, Princeton has multiple extremely involved and skilled music ensembles. While Rice would provide excellent outcomes to me post graduation, Princeton would provide even better ones when considering the alumni network (and that I want to end up on the east coast after I graduate). Lastly, Princeton is a new environment to me. While Rice would undoubtedly feel \u201cnew\u201d in the transition to college life, Princeton would really broaden my horizons and expose me to a new area and the people and culture in that new area (seasons included!).<br>After careful deliberation, I decided to commit to Princeton. The decision really tore me apart. It was so difficult to turn down Rice after all of the positive experiences I\u2019ve had with the school. Also, I\u2019m the first person in my family to go somewhere other than Rice. To be honest, Rice felt very safe and homey. Going to Princeton is a risk, but I think it\u2019s one that I\u2019m going to be glad I took.<br>Having decided on Princeton, I\u2019m trying not to think about Rice (it feels sorta like breaking up with a significant other!). Rather, I\u2019m trying to enjoy the little bit of high school I have yet while also building up excitement to head to New Jersey in the fall.<br>Thank you all for your insight on my decision.
