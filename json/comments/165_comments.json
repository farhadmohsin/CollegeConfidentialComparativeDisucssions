I would vote BC. Lovely campus vs none. Higher ranked overall. Although in the top 50 they are all excellent Selectivity on a huge rise at BC although already super select. Meaning smart classmates. Large and growing endowment. New buildings and investment in infrastructure. Brand new field house with beautiful gym, pools and dance rooms for students. The brand new Schiller integrated sciences center which will be cutting edge in cross disciplinary research. New school of engineering adding to science chops. Excellent pre health consulting. And a d1 acc football and basketball team right on campus for fun activities. Hockey too. So many clubs and access to city without being fully integrated into the city.<br><br>", "<b>Username: undergrad2018</b><br><br>It definitely comes down to your preferences and vibe. BU has an urban campus connected to the city (albeit a pretty self contained one confined to a stretch of Commonwealth Ave), whereas BC has a traditional (and very beautiful) collegiate campus ~30 minutes out by public transit.<br>Acknowledging the limits of stereotypes, BU kids are typically seen as trendier and more individualistic, whereas BC kids maintain a preppier, more mainstream image. BU students interact more with local schools, particularly MIT, than do BC kids by virtue of proximity.<br>Contrary to the previous post, I would say BU has made proportionally far greater strides in selectivity than BC; BC has been top-notch for some time, while BU just recently caught up to a similar standard of selectivity. The incoming GPAs and standardized test scores are nearly identical, and BU has a ~6 percentage point lower acceptance rate likely because it draws from a comparitively more extensive international applicant pool. Considering BU\u2019s momentum relative BC, BU will likely make up the 5 spot difference in US News rankings and leapfrog BC by the time you graduate - if rankings are important to you / employers in your prospective field.<br>BC and BU have a similar endowment (~2 bil), but BU shares that amongst roughly twice the student population.<br>BU\u2019s Kilachand center (CILSE) has the same focus on interdisciplinarity, and it was endowed with $100 million dollars by a donation last year that will mean it will dependably pump out ~$5 million in research per year at minimum. BU conducted $400 million in research last year, and BC conducted $193 million. Overall, BU typically carries more weight in the sciences.<br>Case in point, do research on your intended major/career, gauge which one would fit your vibe best, and know you\u2019re picking between two great options.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Leapfrog BC. Perhaps.  Proof is in the pudding. For now they are 5 spots behind in UNWR. Not that rankings are all that.

Both great schools but completely different feel. Hard to imagine you liking both equally based on their differences.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@undergrad2018   Contrary to the post you made earlier. I just checked Forbes all colleges top schools listing.  BC 49 and BU 86. Not saying this is all about rankings because it\u2019s different for each kid.  But leapfrogging BC seems a little ambitious in the next three years.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WildestDream</b><br><br>^ Based on numbers, it\u2019s clear that BU is the school with the momentum here. BU is now more selective than BC based on acceptance rate, and draws a nearly identical student body as BC based on stats, which wasn\u2019t the case a few years ago. It\u2019s also catching up and will probably surpass BC in the overall U.S. news rankings in the near future. BU\u2019s been really ramping up it\u2019s STEM offerings, and it looks like that\u2019s paying off.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>If acceptance rate percentage means adding another 10000 unqualified interested students makes it more selective. Then so be it. They can only take what they can take based on spots available.  So I would look at the average student admitted.  Not marketing prowess.  And when they eclipse BC on either forbes or USNWR I\u2019ll agree. Until then it\u2019s speculation and conjecture on your part.<br><br>", "<b>Username: evergreen5</b><br><br>It\u2019s difficult to compare acceptance rates considering that BU offers ED while BC does not.<br>With the uptick in apps and lowering of acceptance rates everywhere this season, it will be interesting to compare data for the students who choose to enroll at these schools in fall 2018.  Past middle 50 ACT scores for enrolled students:<br>fall 2017 BC 31-33, BU 29-32<br>fall 2016 BC 30-33, BU 28-32<br>Depending on the program of study, these schools are close enough that ranking should not be a factor in the decision.  However, the campuses are so different that it\u2019s hard to imagine a student not having a significant personal preference for one campus over the other.  OP, maybe you need to visit them again, talk with some current students, etc.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hapworth</b><br><br>I think @rickle1 nailed it.  These two schools, though they both have \u201cBoston\u201d in front of their names, could not be more different.  Thus, all things being equal (financially, I mean), you should have a clear sense of what you want.  BC offers the more traditional college experience, complete with D1 football.  BU is more urban and appeals to a more independent student (not just because it is urban but because it is so large: 32K students vs. BC\u2019s 14K).<br>I was surprised to learn, however, that both schools have high percentages of students that live on campus: 75% for BU and 82% for BC.  I would have guessed that a lot of BU students would not live on campus.  I was wrong.  I\u2019m also guessing that at both schools a fair number of upperclassmen (seniors especially perhaps) choose to live away from school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: undergrad2018</b><br><br>@privatebanker If you check out Wall Street Journal\u2019s ranking, you\u2019ll find BU at 40th and BC at 60th. The most widely regarded and commonly referenced ranking is US News.<br><br>", "<b>Username: undergrad2018</b><br><br>@privatebanker I completely agree with you; rejecting 10,000 unqualified applicants does not meaningfully contribute to an institution\u2019s selectivity. That being said, the 64,470 applicants to BU\u2019s class of 2022 had an average ACT of 30 and an unweighted GPA of 3.66: http://www.bu.edu/today/2018/six-quick-stats-about-who-applied-to-the-class-of-2022/. Adding 4,000 applicants in one year with standardized test scores in the 95th percentile would, however, constitute a meaningful uptick in selectivity.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>There both really good. Schools. I would have loved either of them undergrad.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WildestDream</b><br><br>Since rankings were brought up: also check out the various \u201cworld\u201d rankings, where BU far outranks BC. Worldwide, BU enjoys more recognition, so if you wanted to work outside the USA (i.e. Asia), BU may be the more marketable choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>That I can agree with. If you want to work overseas go to BU<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>Two fine schools\u2026 think about the differences and see if you have a preference.<br>Some questions you might ask yourself are:<br>\u2013Do you prefer a more traditional campus or an urban school?<br>\u2013Do you like the idea of a Catholic college or do you prefer a non-sectarian school?<br>\u2013Are you OK with the core curriculum at BC?<br>\u2013Do you like big time sports (BC is in the ACC) or does that not matter a lot to you?<br>\u2013Is one school better in your area of interest academically?<br>If you ask me personally, I\u2019d choose BC.  I do think you have four undergraduate years and I like the idea of being on a more traditional campus.  But two reasonable people could come up with two different answers depending on their own preferences.<br><br>", "<b>Username: evergreen5</b><br><br>@undergrad2018 Indeed, BU has become more selective in recent years.  From your link, BU\u2019s ED applicants increased 8% over last year and total apps increased 6%.  Also note that BC\u2019s EA apps increased 15% and total apps increased 9% over last year.<br>I\u2019m not sure how much the stats of the pool tell us without the context of the admitted stats and later, the enrolled student stats.  For BU, class of 2022\u2019s admitted average ACT is 32 and SAT 1468 https://dailyfreepress.com/blog/2018/03/22/bu-admits-class-of-2022/.  For BC, 33 and 1448 http://bcheights.com/2018/03/26/bc-accepts-27-percent-2022-applicants/.  Enrolled stats for both will be lower.<br>It\u2019ll be interesting to see where yield takes these schools this year.  If I recall correctly, both were overenrolled last year, so it makes sense that both were conservative in numbers of acceptances this year.  By my math, BU accepted about 14,184 this year, down from 15203 last year, aiming for a class of 3300, which would be a yield of 23%.  BC accepted 8400, down from 9200 last year, aiming for a class of 2300, which would be a yield of 27%.

And as far as USN&WR is concerned, acceptance rate is only a minor factor in determining selectivity. They evaluate selectivity using the following factors:<br>65% weight - SAT or ACT scores for enrolled (not admitted) students<br>25% weight - fraction of enrolled (not admitted) students in top 10% of their high school class<br>10% weight - acceptance rate<br>In other words, \u201cselectivity\u201d is not really determined by the number of students that a school turns away. Instead, it\u2019s mostly determined by the quality of the students that a school attracts.<br>In the 2018 ranking, BC was ranked #28 for selectivity specifically, while BU was ranked #45. Note that these are just the ranks for selectivity, which is only one component of the overall ranking. BU ranked higher than BC in other components, like \u201cfaculty resources\u201d, and so the overall rankings were closer.<br>So there is a good case that BC is the more \u201cselective\u201d school. However, it would be foolish to choose BC over BU solely on that basis.<br><br>", "<b>Username: IzzoOne</b><br><br>I agree on admit rates not being a great indicator of selectivity.  The modern phenomenon of low admit rates is largely due to the relative ease of applying to multiple schools combined with marketing programs to get as many to apply or not whether or not they are qualified.  A cynical view would be to say they are inducing unqualified students to apply to be rejected.  The number of high stat kids has not skyrocketed (although high school grade inflation is rampant).  Unfortunately, other metrics used by USNews are open to manipulation as well.<br>I would say historically, BC has had the better reputation and a more traditional campus experience.
