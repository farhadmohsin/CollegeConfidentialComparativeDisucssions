{"title": "engineering school in northwestern vs u mich", "comments": ["<b>Username: phoebehana4</b><br><br>My daughter is accepted into the Engineering school at U of I (in state), U Mich and Northwestern.  U Mich and Northwestern both offer merit scholarship that nearly matches the in-state tuition of U of I.  Daughter has written U of I off because she does not like the campus.  We have not had the chance to visit Ann Arbor.  The tour of U Mich Engineering school on the days that I\u2019m able to take vacation is all booked although I still plan to drive to Ann Arbor for a general campus tour (we live in Chicago).  Due to the proximity, daughter has heard a lot about and leaning toward Northwestern.  I\u2019d appreciate opinions from those who have intimate knowledge of both programs/campuses.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sushiritto</b><br><br>@Knowsstuff has a sophomore/junior in UMich Engineering and lives on North Campus, which is where the Engineering Campus is located. He/she can fill you in on the details. He/she also lives in the Chicago area.<br>I\u2019m a parent of a freshman in LSA, so I\u2019d be happy to fill you in on any other details at UMich.<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsenior1</b><br><br>Great options on the table!<br>I think one of the biggest differences is the quarter vs semester system.  NU stresses the ability to easily add double majors or minors but students are jumping into their classes immediately with no ramp up because the quarters are so short.<br>There is also a huge size difference between the two school.<br>Can you send your DD to Michigan alone?    Lots of students will make those visits without parents.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Knowsstuff</b><br><br>@phoebehana4. @sushiritto speaks the truth. I live in Chicago and my son went to one of the well known and number 1 selective enrollment high schools. He was excepted to both as well and didn\u2019t want to go to either since we live closer to Northwestern and none of us cared for UIUC school /grounds /attitude towards engineering students. He also wanted to go to school with kids with his type of stats. Northwestern and Michigan would provide that as the students are similar. He is in Industrial engineering and Michigan is ranked second in the world in that. He was wait listed from Georgia Tech which was first.<br>My son lived on Central campus his first year and on North husk second. He likes both for different reasons. Keep in mind you can live anywhere you want to including apartments all 4 years but Michigan randomly places you the first year anyhow.<br>His school is like a feeder for Northwestern and University of Chicago. He spent 3 weeks on Northwestern campus doing a year of stats in 3 weeks in 11 th grade summer with 12 other kids. They called that fun and thought it was easy. He really didn\u2019t care for the campus. He told me he does less walking to campus now then he did in NW campus. They lived in Dorms there also. I actually love both campuses. There is just a different feel when at Michigan to us. You \u201cneed\u201d to visit Michigan now question. Both central and North campus can look baren depending on the day. Both have great school spirit. They are close educationally and again have students. Both have great campuses.These two schools are more similar then different. My son wanted to go away to school. Going to NW was to close for his likening. He would be home on the El in less then 30 minutes\u2026 Lol\u2026<br>My son is the chairperson of an augmented /mixed reality conference this weekend. Go and see what student\u2019s actually do in the spare time 11 lectures and 20 exhibits. If you need to know more how Michigan supports their engineering students PM me. Have to go into surgery now.<br><br>", "<b>Username: simba9</b><br><br>I\u2019d say both schools are good enough so that this would boil down to an issue of where your daughter feels most comfortable.<br>Absolutely everyone I know who went to Michigan loves the school and Ann Arbor.<br><br>", "<b>Username: phoebehana4</b><br><br>Thanks to everyone\u2019s comments.  Personally, although I have never been to Ann Arbor, I feel that Ann Arbor is a better choice for a young adult learning to be independent. NU students are required to live in dorm for the first two years.  When they do live off campus, they end up living in Rogers park or somewhere in the city and take CTA to school.  In comparison, Ann Arbor is cheaper in housing and safer for new drivers (she has yet learned to drive).  Daughter does like the ease to double major in NU.  I also suspect that she is more impressionable to the perceived \u201celite\u201d status of NU. So are many of her friends who have been accepted into both.<br>Other than the different feels of these two towns, ultimately I would like to compare these two engineering schools.  Daughter is very strong in STEM but her interests are very broad. Although she picked mechanical engineering, her initially love was chemistry and more recently she is talking about biomedical engineering or environmental sciences.  The UMich scholarship is contingent upon her declaration of engineering major at the end of freshman year while NU scholarship does not have any restriction.  Thus my questions are - How easy is it to switch from one engineering major to another in UMich? How easy is it to double major in UMich (for example, mechanical engineering major and environmental biology minor?)<br><br>", "<b>Username: StanfordGSB00</b><br><br>@phoebehana4 - I am pasting what I wrote in another similar thread. Both are great schools.  I would recommend Northwestern because it is more exclusive / elite at the undergraduate level. Most students at Michigan cannot get into Northwestern, except maybe the top 10-20%. Top 10 in USNews vs. Top 30. And now to SAT / ACT scores, Northwestern has had significantly higher scores for many many years compared to Michigan. About a 100 point difference in SAT average until the last year, when scores have been re-centered (causing the scores to converge towards the top). And it is not just about test scores when it comes to exclusive, elite admissions - Harvard could enroll a class with a 1600 perfect SAT average. They are looking for very talented, unique individuals. Northwestern / Duke / Dartmouth, Stanford, etc. could similarly enroll a class with a 1550 SAT average if they wanted to but UMichigan could not. Go look at the RD decisions threads for these schools and you\u2019ll see a ton of students with 1500+ SAT scores / 34+ ACT scores (with perfect grades) rejected on the regular.<br>Northwestern is significantly more impressive on the pedigree level / resume. Why would you pay the same amount of $$$$ to go to a large public school (which is still awesome but not quite the same level as NW) when you can go an elite private school with more resources, a higher caliber student body, smaller classes, etc. It is extremely easy to switch in/out of Engineering and go into WCAS / Engineering. I think this is a no brainer to go Northwestern if money is no issue. If Michigan was giving a full-ride scholarship, then I would say Michigan could be a great option. But, in this instance, I would go to Northwestern and switch in / out of engineering (to Arts / Sciences). Or double major, etc. UMichigan alums will disagree here but if money is not a factor, 90% of students are choosing NW over UMichigan. Good luck and congrats on the acceptances<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>Northwestern University offers some certificate programs that merge different areas of study. For example, there should be at least one certificate program for engineering in conjunction with the graduate business school (Kellogg School of Business) and several others that make grads very attractive to a variety of employers.<br>Because the Michigan scholarship has a major contingency while the Northwestern University award does not, the choice is clear.<br>Good news is that she will be able to attend either school for graduate school if in her plans.<br>P.S. Agree that the quarter system allows for more flexibility in areas of study & for double majoring or adding minors to a major.<br>Also, Northwestern University has a significant Greek presence\u2013especially sororities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: IWannaHelp</b><br><br>Most people at NU have at least a minor on top of their major if not having two majors. It seems that the school has a strong history of fostering interdisciplinary pursuit and creating interdisciplinary curriculum like \u201cengineering first\u201d back in 1997 and MMSS as well as ISP way back in the 70s.<br>Another strong point not reflected in any ranking is the financial support NU give for undergraduate research. Last year, they received 203 applications and funded 134 proposals. These are original research during the school year, not counting the independent summer research or ones led by graduate students/professors.<br>Two years ago, total funds for undergraduate research were $1.3 million for 563 projects, a 365% increase over a 10-year period. The number of applications were around 900 which means majority of applications were granted. The number is even higher now (though I don\u2019t have the figure).<br>JHU may be number 1 in research funding, but their list of UNDERGRADUATE summer research winners is way shorter than NU. This just goes to show how you absolutely can\u2019t go by those rankings.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sushiritto</b><br><br>@Knowsstuff Hopefully, you\u2019re the doctor and not the patient. <br>Just from a cursory look at the UMich CoE website, adding or combining majors and/or minors, whether in LSA or Music/Dance/Theater, as examples, doesn\u2019t appear to be that difficult other than actually taking the extra courses.<br>https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/ug-ed/other-minors/<br>https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/ug-ed/degrees/<br>I know for my LSA STEM kid, adding 5 additional LSA courses, will get an additonal minor in a STEM subject. UMich also gives credit for AP courses taken in HS, so it\u2019s not as bad as it sounds. As an example, a 5 in AP Calc BC removed then need to take Calc 1 and 2.<br>From what I read here, NU doesn\u2019t have much school spirit, at least in terms of sports. Just recently, someone posted that NU gives away FREE tickets to sports (football, basketball, etc.) in order to get students to games. Let\u2019s just say UMich doesn\u2019t have that problem. Basketball games are sold out and 111,000 of your closest friends pack the Big House each and every home Saturday date. UMich competes for national championships, NU not as much. School spirit matters for some but not others. It mattered for my kid.<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsenior1</b><br><br>I live very near NU and it was next to impossible to come by football tickets this Fall.

The co-op program at NU was very rewarding for me both academically and professionally (I think Michigan has one too) and the smaller overall enrollment allows students to easily make friends with those outside of one\u2019s major as well as have more personal interactions with professors. The name recognition of NU as a \u201ctop ten\u201d school can also open doors. I loved the campus situated on Lake Michigan, and the school has invested recently in spectacular new world class facilities, from sciences to sports to business school to music.<br>Now to my favorite topic: NU football. The school just opened a $400 million facility right on Lake Michigan with million-dollar views of the Chicago skyline. There is a full-size indoor football field with one wall of glass looking out onto the lake. Students can use the Athletic center that is part of the complex.  The coach is the legendary alum Pat Fitzgerald who is on a 10-year contract (after turning down an offer from Michigan) and just won the Big 10 West championship last year going 8-1, not to mention topping off the season with his 3rd straight bowl win. The program will continue to compete for championships.<br>Basketball went to the NCAA tournament two years ago (beating Michigan to basically clinch a spot), and opened the newly renovated Welsh-Ryan arena this season to rave reviews. The fans may not be present in huge numbers, but they are just as fanatical and it can be a loud, rocking environment.<br>There is a very active Greek life, but non-Greek life can be enjoyable too with residential colleges, etc. The proximity to Chicago is a plus, and Evanston itself has been transformed into a vibrant city with trendy restaurants and shops within the past decade.<br>If the financial side of the equation is taken care of by merit scholarships, it is a no-brainer to pick NU.  Just my biased view. <br><br>", "<b>Username: rjkofnovi</b><br><br>\u201c\u2026it is a no brainer to pick NU.\u201d  That kind of remark is not helpful at all to a student deciding between these two peer universities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>I think that the poster was referring to NU with a guaranteed scholarship versus Michigan with a contingent scholarship.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rjkofnovi</b><br><br>^^^^except the OP never said that.

Nice but like a high school size. Michigan is more like a religious experience\u2026 Plainly, even if your not into sports it\u2019s just fun!<br>My son just paid for his football season tickets a few days ago. Both schools anyone can get tickets on Stubhub etc.<br>As far as scholarships Michigan gives out very few most are Michigan grants. Money is money no problem there\u2026 Don\u2019t worry about declaring they treat you like family and are very interested in your child success. This is very rare at a large school. Don\u2019t believe me, email the head of the department or engineering admissions etc and see how you are treated. It is vastly different between these two schools.<br>As far as majoring /minoring etc switching majors at anytime etc. Very easy at Michigan. They will support any of your choices. You can do anything you want at Michigan engineering and the school will support the kids. My son is living proof of that. Engineering with a music minor is big at both schools. Combine anything with anything at Michigan, not a problem.<br>As far of the comments of prestige\u2026 Seems we have some NW fans coming on this thread\u2026 Haha\u2026 . Both great schools. In Chicago proper the perception is Michigan is a bigger deal and harder to get into. Engineering is 3.93(unweighted) with 33/34 Act. I don\u2019t think NW is much higher then that. Michigan lsa is 3.83 with 32/33 and both higher for OOS. So please stop the mine is shiner then yours crap! It\u2019s not helping the OP or anyone. Both are world-class universities. Both have world class research facilities. Both have world class hospital systems.<br>For the poster comparing private VS public\u2026 Michigan runs like a private school but who cares. 11 billion in reserves, I think their doing OK.<br>Here is something that no one has addressed and alert\u2026 It\u2019s a serious subject .<br>Both schools for engineering are very hard. Michigan claims at least a full grade drop from Freshman to Senior year in engineering. Maintaining a \u201cb\u201d avg is not as easy as it seems. Stress! How each school handles this is different. There have been a record number of suicides at Northwestern in the last few years. We actually know of two of them. If your students need this type of help or counseling prior to admission please check out both schools and how they handle this. This is Not a reason not to go to NW BTW. But something to look into.<br>There is an engineering class that goes into all the disciplines. I recommend doing that. When visiting Michigan make an appointment with a professor or head of your department or peer student. This should open up your eyes on the school.<br>Both schools intertwine the creative minds like engineering , theater/arts , design majors, medical. This is what North Campus is made of for Michigan. When you go there you will see this group of large blah buildings. Well, some of the world\u2019s leading research is being done that your child can participate in, in those blah buildings.<br>Alumni is strong at both schools if the students reach out.<br>You don\u2019t have a bad decision here. It really comes down to fit /feel of the schools. Both schools have really smart kids that will challenge each other. It depends on how competitive your child wants the environment. My son wanted this environment coming from the type of high school he went to. It was what he was used to, good or bad.<br>Again you just need to visit Michigan to see what\u2019s its like. Please pm me if you want inside information on engineering and opportunities that exists at Michigan. Again, you can do anything you want to there.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Knowsstuff</b><br><br>Class size. Sorry my son\u2019s Calc and other classes some had 20 students others have more.

Etc I know at Michigan you can type your question live and it\u2019s answered right there and then if you don\u2019t want to to raise your hand. Forgot the name of the program they use for it. If you need more explanation just email, ask the professor live (crazy huh? ?), go to office hours. Peer to peer labs etc etc. If you need the help it\u2019s there for the taking.

Both campuses have stuff to do there plus this crazy thing called studying ?. It is Not unusual at both schools for people to be in the library or wherever on Saturday night.<br>Northwestern has more of a Greek vibe but at either school you don\u2019t have to be involved.<br>At Michigan the city of Ann Arbor surrounds you on Central campus. More places that are student affordable to eat at. More stores in general.<br>Detroit is up and coming and Midtown is really amazing. I live in Chicago but grew up outside Detroit so it\u2019s a big change. Again cool to go downtown but it\u2019s not done as much as people think you would go.<br>On North Campus it\u2019s more like the suburbs to me.

Our tour also showcased the clubs solely for CoE clubs. I\u2019m most grateful to the individual attention we received from UMich staff.  I emailed the CoE financial aid office and academic advising to set up one-on-one meetings and they promptly accommodated us. Both staff patiently answered all our questions. The adviser took note of my daughter\u2019s AP credits and gave her a rough 4-year study plan.  Ann Arbor is a neat place with an eclectic collection of shops.  However, the cold reality is that the scholarship UMich offers is strictly tethered to CoE.  Even though it\u2019s a big deal (100 out of 1400 freshmen or maybe 100 out of ~500 OOS students are awarded), it still gives us pause. Plus, the awarded amount is not adjusted to yearly (~4.5%) tuition increase.  No additional funds are available for summer study abroad.<br>NU advising turned down my request for a personal meeting and instead directed us to the engineering school campus tour.  It was an hour-long informational session mostly on their co-op program.  We did manage to talk to a financial aid officer in person and it appeared that NU is rather generous and hands-off on awarding scholarship. They may even award additional study abroad aid for the summer quarter.  And if tuition increases in the future while our income does not change, the financial aid may adjust accordingly (but sure there is a possibility that the reverse may occur). Other than maintaining satisfactory progress, there is no string attached to the financial aid.<br>After reading through NU online study plan and AP credits listing, it appears that D has had at least 11.68 units under her belt (I think. I wish that NU advising would talk to us). This is nearly equivalent to one year of course work in NU (12 units per year and 48 units for four years).  In contrast, she would have had 16 credits in UMich, which is equivalent to one semester of course work (a total of 128 credits for 4 years).<br>D is still torn between these two programs although she is leaning towards NU mostly based on the financial aid and the fact that she could easily shorten one year (she is currently taking three more AP courses in her senior year that are not counted in yet) of study in NU.

It\u2019s good that while you realize you\u2019d choose Mich she\u2019s not you.  Sounds like she feels a pull to Northwestern.  The thing I come back to is her scholarship.  I\u2019ve read 30% of engineering students overall change their major and it seems like there\u2019s already at least a seed in her mind that she might want to go different direction. . .<br>Northwestern offers a lot \u2014 and if she does want to build that rocket she can go to Mich for grad school!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>phoebehana4, this is a difficult decision. Many students currently enrolled at Michigan and Northwestern have faced the same dilemma. In fact, it is quite possibly the most common \u201cserious\u201d decision faced by students attending either one of those two universities.<br>We are talking about two of the top universities in the nation. When it comes academics, flexibility, resources, opportunities, placement and prestige, they are comparable. Students can major in Engineering while pursing a liberal arts approach at both. Students can branch out and seek our an entrepreneurship program, or a business certificate or minor at both universities as well. Students will be smart and intellectually inclined at both schools. Opportunities for research, and placement into graduate school and the corporate world will be equally plentiful at Michigan and Northwestern.<br>Where they differ is in the unique and specific programs that they offer, their academic calendars and their respective campus vibe/culture/life. One cannot go wrong choosing either one of those two. In other words, your daughter should go with her gut.<br>And for the record, there are six Michigan undergraduate alumni that are currently CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, compared to two Northwestern undergraduate alumni, and both universities are absolutely stellar in the STEM fields. So your daughter can build rockets, and become CEO by attending either one of those two institutions! <br><br>", "<b>Username: CU123</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>And for the record, there are six Michigan undergraduate alumni that are currently CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, compared to two Northwestern undergraduate alumni<br>\"\"<br><br>Well seeing UM has 3.5 times the number of graduates, I\u2019d say NW comes out a head on that one.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\u201cNorthwestern is significantly more impressive on the pedigree level / resume.\u201d<br>StanfordGSB00, I am not sure who told you that, but by and large, most employers, from Fortune 500 companies to Investment Banks, and from Silicon Valley techs to Management Consulting firms do not differentiate between Michigan and Northwestern. As far as academe is concerned, Michigan and Northwestern are considered equally prestigious. Outside of the crowd that worships the US News (aka, impressionable high school children and parents), there are not many highly educated adults who would agree with your statement.<br>\u201cWhy would you pay the same amount of $$$$ to go to a large public school (which is still awesome but not quite the same level as NW) when you can go an elite private school with more resources, a higher caliber student body, smaller classes, etc.\u201d<br>So let me get this straight, Michigan is merely a \u201clarge public school\u201d, but Northwestern is elite? Are you for real? First of all, Northwestern does not have more resources than Michigan. You clearly need to study Michigan more before laying such claims. Students, on average, are indeed of a slightly higher caliber at Northwestern, but the students at Michigan are not far behind. Classes at Northwestern will be smaller than at Michigan, but that is mainly thanks to the thousands of freshman seminars offered at Northwestern. Remove seminars from the equation, and Michigan and Northwestern will have a similar ratio of large:mid-sized:small classes. Intro level classes at Northwestern will be smaller, but still large. Intermediate and advanced classes at both universities will be roughly the same size.<br>\u201cUMichigan alums will disagree here but if money is not a factor, 90% of students are choosing NW over UMichigan.\u201d<br>That is a grossly exaggerated figure. While there are many students who choose Michigan over Northwestern because of cost, there are probably just as many who choose Northwestern over Michigan for the same reason. I would say that when you cross out financial decisions, cross admits choose Northwestern over Michigan on a two third to one third basis. But it should be noted that the disparity is due to ignorance, not objective analysis of the pros and cons. High school students are impressionable and easily swayed by criteria that are, quite frankly, immaterial. Impartial students who choose to look at those two objectively will be equally split between Michigan and Northwestern.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\u201cWell seeing UM has 3.5 times the number of graduates, I\u2019d say NW comes out a head on that one.\u201d<br>CU123, I clearly stated that phoebehana\u2019s daughter can attend either university if she wishes to build rockets or become CEO. I did not give the edge to either university.<br><br>"]}
