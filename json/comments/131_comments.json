You will receive a regular commmision versus reserve.  It doesn\u2019t mean that much, but does carry some weight the higher you climb in your career.

Our son was sponsored for a Draper fellowship to MIT Lincoln Labs upon graduation, but he was selected to serve in the Cyber Corp at Branch Night in November, and Cyber changed the rules just weeks prior.  It now requires an additional service year (six instead of five), and all Cyber officers must attend graduate school sometime during their service stint but, for our son, not right out of the academy. As of now, it looks like the degree he will complete is at Carnegie Mellon, but that could change.  In any case, our son did not regret passing up his other (better academic) undergraduate options as he would have the opportunity for grad school later on.  His goal was always, first and foremost, to be an Army or Navy officer, and he wanted the 24x7 military immersion and leadership training at an academy.  Different strokes.<br>I will say, though, and I\u2019ve posted elsewhere that, until he was fully into his major, our son found the academics at West Point underwhelming.  The brain trust is there, but cadets (and mids at Navy) sometimes have to seek it out.  The academies\u2019 goal is to get everyone to graduation which is sometimes at odds with the academic experience\u2013and, only about 1/3 of any incoming class is chosen for academic chops as the military values brains and brawn somewhat equally.  However, you can\u2019t beat the academies for small class sizes (sometimes fewer than ten, no more than twenty), direct access to that brain trust, incredible facilities, and hands-on leadership and strategy experience.

This might matter less in certain fields, but when we were talking about it, his description of the academic experience sounded consistent with an institution that requires conformity and obedience to command to function.

Evaluating the academies against civilian universities is an apples to oranges comparison. The SAs value a combination of brains, brawn, and leadership\u2013as they must. When our son discussed the general academic rigor at West Point with his department head, the LTC explained to him that only about one third of the incoming class is selected for academics; the other 2/3rds are chosen for other equally shiny traits. All are academically capable, all pass the academic bar, but only that third is what you might label \u201cscholarly.\u201d Our son has learned to value those other critical equally shiny traits in his band of brothers very highly. The corps needs a balance of all of them in a way civilian colleges do not as their missions differ vastly.  The Army puts it this way (as inscribed in stone at West Point):<br>The society that separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting done by fools. -Thucydides-<br>The service academies are looking to produce capable officers for each branch of our armed services. It takes a certain kind of kid to go this route, and those kids don\u2019t always look like the applicants to the usual civilian suspects.  If academics rather than service is the main concern of any applicant\u2019s college evaluation, then the SAs probably aren\u2019t for them, not because that applicant can\u2019t be academically satisfied (s/he can) but because getting through a SA and the years of service that follow takes a gut commitment to something else.<br>(And, yes, @ucbalumnus, our son\u2019s high school academic preparation was \u201con the high end of academic strength compared to that of other incoming first year cadets,\u201d so he is one of those students considered scholarly and is one of a pool of cadets who can assure others like the OP\u2019s son that they will find their intellectual peers at an academy.)<br><br>\"\"<br>By pursuing that nomination, some other hopeful was denied the chance to attend the USNA.<br>\"\"<br><br>As with any college, each accepted/nominated student has earned the right to determine whether to accept or reject that admission/nomination but, as pointed out upthread, no congressional nominations go unused, they continue to fall down each congressional slate until all slots are filled.

One parent told me that the waiver was for well-controlled seasonal allergies(hay fever) and the student was floored(and left scrambling for private loans) a short time school began.  Admittedly, this is all anecdotal information.  The concern is arbitrary application of standards after the fact.<br>But it\u2019s my understanding that if a person is granted a medical waiver for ROTC and then is discharged for medical reasons, there is no service obligation and no obligation to pay the scholarship back.

Both lead to a commission if that\u2019s the main goal, but the college experiences are worlds apart, and I can\u2019t imagine anyone drawn to one being equally drawn to the other.    @STF4717\u2019s comment about USNA (any academy) being \u201cuncollege\u201d is an apt description.  Navy even sells tee-shirts that say \u201cNOT College.\u201d<br>Personally, other than cost, I don\u2019t see the attraction to the academies.  If officership is the goal, the ROTC programs get the same job done with much less pain and a better college experience. And even the current and former officers who moderate over on the SA forums admit and have posted links to data showing that academy grads in this century no longer have any military career advantage over ROTC officers.  And, of course, former USNA professor Bruce Fleming has been vocal in his opinion of the academies for years:<br>https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/21/opinion/21fleming.html?emc=eta1<br>@C1nj:  The \u201cfuture officer\u201d in your son will end up with a commission from either source, but he needs to decide if he wants 24x7 military immersion while earning it or a normal college experience.  Both can provide him the academic and intellectual challenge he seeks though he may need to find his peers initially and advocate for himself among the faculty brain trust at USNA.  But don\u2019t be misled \u2014 USNA absolutely can deliver on the intellectual front.<br>As others, including me, have said upthread, if your son truly is still conflicted, he can try USNA commitment-free for two years and still have Ivy transfer prospects, assuming he retains top academic status amid the relentless physical and military requirements at the academy.  If he stays and graduates in the top half of his class, he will also have fine prospects for a top-notch grad program also at government expense.<br>TLDR:  Your son really can\u2019t go wrong either way.  He will be intellectually satisfied and a Naval officer regardless of his choice.  He just needs to decide which college experience he prefers.<br><br>", "<b>Username: C1nj</b><br><br>I believe a portion of his indecision stems from the amount of work it took to receive his USNA appointment.<br>So many interviews, medical tests, medical waivers, physical fitness exams, essays, recommendations etc.<br>Applying to an Ivy was relatively easy in comparison. With that being said, I do realize the acceptance rate is even lower at many Ivies including Princeton.<br>In addition, his older classmates at his high school were in a similar situation. One had to choose between Princeton, MIT and USNA and another between MIT and USNA. They both chose USNA. This may be muddying the waters as well.<br>@ChoatieMom You are correct. He should of come to some conclusion by now. I believe the underlying issue is he really isn\u2019t sure where he wants to be in 10 years. He wants to do something exciting but he really isn\u2019t interested in a career in the military.<br>Once again, thank you everyone for your input. It is very helpful.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SailingMomof2</b><br><br>\u201cHe wants to do something exciting but he really isn\u2019t interested in a career in the military.\u201d I think here is your answer right off the bat.<br><br>", "<b>Username: C1nj</b><br><br>@SailingMomof2 You may be correct.<br>I think he sees himself serving 4-5 years active duty or long term in the National Guard or Reserves. He feels he has an obligation to serve his country. He doesn\u2019t want to do a 20-30 year active duty career.<br>The choice actually is between Army ROTC and USNA. Army ROTC does have some great advantages. You can choose any major and you have the option between active duty, reserves, or National Guard.<br>USNA is a 5 year active duty commitment but the Navy has fighter jets and romantic travel. Remember, we are still dealing with an 18 year old.<br>He lost his Air Force ROTC scholarship due to a medical disqualification. I think that would of sealed the deal for Princeton.

If this is truly the case, he should opt for Princeton without ROTC and consider OCS if he still wants to serve post grad.  If his heart isn\u2019t pining for a commission then, he\u2019s gotten a fine undergraduate education with no military commitment, and he can get on with his life.<br>I will also add that if he isn\u2019t interested in a military career, one thing the academy route WILL do is prove that rather quickly \u2014 and painfully.  He should not underestimate the scathing difficulty of Plebe year from the military perspective.  He will be stretched to his physical and emotional limits only to be built back up very slowly (and, again, painfully) over the remaining three years; that\u2019s the program at all of the academies as these new officers are being trained to lead and make decisions under extreme pressure.  He will need a strong commitment to the end goal to sustain him through the brutality.  Plebe year is a weed-out exercise, and attrition is high at all of the academies as each mid\u2019s/cadet\u2019s motives and internal strength are put to the test.  That\u2019s why I emphasized choosing the college experience over any other factors first.<br>I also think that no discussion of choosing to attend a service academy can skirt the fundamental fact that the purpose of these schools is to prepare officers for war.  They are not just \u201cdifferent\u201d college choices.  They are schools of warfare and their main mission is not academics.  Our world is not getting any safer.  More and more officers are going to be needed to carry out our country\u2019s decisions.  To this end, USMA branched 81% of the class of 2019 into combat arms.  You can be certain that 81% of the class did not select a combat arms branch as a first choice.  Though mids and cadets may be able to select their majors, they serve at the needs of the military, and the military ultimately controls in which area they will serve. It was enlightening to our son to find out that undergraduate major is only a consideration for a handful of branches.  It was also enlightening to find that the various branches (Army has 17) have various service commitments; five is the minimum.  In our son\u2019s case, he went into USMA thinking he\u2019d five-and-dive, but the branch he was selected for had a longer service commitment, and he was also selected for grad school, so the Army will own him for the next nine years.  He\u2019s fine with that because his goals align with the Army\u2019s choices for him, but this lack of autonomy cannot be overlooked.  (FWIW, he\u2019s also at the top of his class.  Class rank, of which academics is only one factor, does not equal autonomy.)<br>I wish your son well, @C1nj.  I\u2019m sure he is a fine young man who would make a fine officer, but he needs to decide where his heart lies.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ChoatieMom</b><br><br><br><br><br> @ucbalumnus:<br>\"\"<br>Would the medical issue be a problem in the USNA, Navy ROTC, or service in the Navy?<br>\"\"<br><br>@C1nj posted upthread that USNA issued a waiver for his condition, so the Navy has determined it is not an issue for Navy service.<br><br>", "<b>Username: C1nj</b><br><br>He received a medical waiver.<br>However, if his condition resurfaced he could be forced out. I don\u2019t think this is likely but you never know.<br>If it resurfaced at Princeton, he could be separated from Army ROTC, but at least he still would be at Princeton and we could afford the tuition.<br><br>", "<b>Username: C1nj</b><br><br>\u201copt for Princeton without ROTC and consider OCS if he still wants to serve post grad\u201d<br>It\u2019s ironic that you said that @ChoatieMom. Three students on SAF are in the same situation as my son.<br>They have decided to forgo the ROTC scholarship, partly due to Princeton\u2019s generous financial aid, and pursue OCS after graduation.<br>It\u2019s a great idea but I doubt my son would go along. Plus he still can try ROTC for one year without any obligation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PtonAlumnus</b><br><br>It sounds as if your son would like to be a pilot.  If he becomes a pilot then realistically he will stay in for 20 years.  The AF and Navy require about a 12 year commitment for pilots.  The retirement pay at 20 years is too good to pass up.  If he is a pilot for 20 years then becoming a commercial air line pilot becomes very attractive.<br>If he want a military career there are significant advantages to the service academy.  You may need medical counsel to make an informed decision on the probability that his medical condition will resurface and disqualify him for military service.  If he wants a career as an engineer then Princeton will be better preparation.  As @Hamurtle posted earlier General Mark A. Milley has been nominated  to serve as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Princeton does not preclude a long and successful military career.<br>Applying for OCS is not a sure thing.  If your son wants multiple options AROTC at Princeton will provide that opportunity.  At the end of his freshman year he can be dedicated to a short military career or find out that the military is not for him.  At the end of his commitment he can stay in the military.  We have multiple members of our family that have served in the military; they all complain bitterly but are proud of their service.  Some like the military; some do not.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bopper</b><br><br>@C1nj  And the final answer is??<br><br>", "<b>Username: OneMoreKid</b><br><br>Without reading through everything - we had a Princeton grad superstar in my Marine Corps OCS platoon as well as several Navy Academy grads in the next 6 months of training.

Some of my friends that went that route got out after their initial commitment and don\u2019t fly anymore.  Some that were offered flight training ended up being dropped for one reason or another.  One can accomplish the same goals regardless of where they went for undergrad.  It\u2019s probably more about the desired undergrad experience than what would come after.<br>That would be a heck of a choice if you have it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: C1nj</b><br><br>My son ended up choosing Princeton AROTC.

In fact, he is applying to Bridge Year.<br>A letter was also sent to the Senator who appointed him to USNA. My son thanked him for the appointment and explained why he declined it.<br>Unless you go through the process, most people have no idea how much work is involved in securing an appointment to a service academy.

The candidates on the waiting list never get a chance.<br>\"\"<br><br>The academies account for no-shows in their yield formulas.  Just like other colleges, one candidate who does not report does not translate to someone in the National Wait List (NWL) pool who doesn\u2019t get a call.  Let\u2019s say USNA needs an incoming class of 1,300 to eventually commission 1,000 officers four years later (both USNA and USMA expect to lose about 300 mids/cadets between I/R-Day and graduation) and sends out 1,500 offers of appointment to yield that 1,300.  The academy is not underenrolled until the 201st candidate declines or fails to show, and they\u2019ve padded enough to never be in that position prior to the start of the Plebe academic year.  In addition to no-shows, the padding accounts for fall-outs during Plebe summer, academic, honor, and medical separations over the four years, and attrition due to those who decide not to take the oath and commit prior to the start of junior year.  So, there\u2019s no need to be concerned that anyone in the NWL pool was cheated by a handful of appointees who don\u2019t show up for I-Day; the candidates in that pool didn\u2019t even make the initial padded list.  No one is just one turn-down or no-show away.<br>That said, a handful of candidates do get pulled from the NWL each year, but not due to no-shows.<br>Congrats to your son, @c1nj.  That decision  seemed like a no-brainer to me.<br><br>"]}
