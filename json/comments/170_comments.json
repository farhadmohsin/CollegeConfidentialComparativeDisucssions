{"title": "amherst vs dartmouth", "comments": ["<b>Username: gigichuck</b><br><br>Hey everyone!<br>I\u2019m sure this particular question has been asked a thousand times and I\u2019ve probably read through every single one of them lol. Before I commit to any school, I want to make sure I don\u2019t leave any stone unturned. So a little backstory. I\u2019m an international from Nigeria, and I\u2019m sixteen years old. I was also accepted to Lafayette (Marquis Scholar), Wesleyan, and Minerva at KGI, in case anyone thinks I should really reconsider them. So those are my two top choices. Financial Aid is good at both, slightly better at Amherst, but hopefully they\u2019ll match.<br>Right now grad school is not in the picture. My intended major is either Computer Science or Engineering. Either way I\u2019d end up at Thayer  I haven\u2019t had a chance to visit either. I\u2019m also a very broke international, in case that matters. My financial aid is nearly the full cost of attendance.<br>Dartmouth pros:<br>Ivy status is cool.<br>I am very used to work hard play hard (though   definitely not the level of partying I should expect)<br>I love the scenery<br>Traditions (bonfire!)<br>D-plan and study abroad is amazing<br>The students seem really cool, nice, and I\u2019ve met more Africans there<br>Dartmouth CS appears to be better<br>The soccer is good! (I love this sport. I hope to play it, but I don\u2019t care if I don\u2019t anyway)<br>Cons:<br>Em\u2026 frats, partying, alcohol? Cold!!!<br>Amherst pros:<br>5 college consortium<br>Nice town<br>Elite LAC status<br>Very welcoming and open community<br>Very diverse<br>Less partying (I think?)<br>Cons:<br>Cold!!!<br>Basically I\u2019d be cold anywhere so oof.<br>Did anyone choose between the two? Which did you choose? Why? Tell me about the dorms, dining, the entertainment, and just life as a student.<br>Thank you so much!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>If you view fraternities as a negative, then Dartmouth College may not be the school for you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Midwestmomofboys</b><br><br>I don\u2019t think there is a meaningful difference in the opportunity to party at Dartmouth vs. Amherst. Both have the opportunity to work hard/play hard \u2013 how much of each is up to the individual student. For what it is worth, a colleague gave a paper at Dartmouth recently and said that the Library was packed on a nice Friday afternoon \u2013 maybe students were getting the work done before the party hard, or maybe they were the work hard kids, but it seemed very intellectually engaged. In terms of culture, Amherst did have underground fraternities which have recently been banned, so Amherst is no stranger to the party scene. Amherst has worked hard to foster economic diversity.  Both have excellent soccer, at least on the Men\u2019s side, which is what I\u2019m familiar with. Dartmouth does have a Women\u2019s Club team which \u2013 at the D1 level \u2013 is usually a very competitive program.  Amherst would have more of an intramural program. If you are interested in the possibility of trying out at either school as a walk-on player, contact the coach quickly to find out what, if any, opportunities there may be. On the D3 side, we\u2019ve seen kids come to pre-season, and either make it or not.<br>It sounds like you somewhat prefer the scene at Dartmouth \u2013 if the money works out, they are both superb, so pick the one that feels more comfortable to you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: OHMomof2</b><br><br>Have you compared - since you are high need - funding for unpaid summer internships and research and study abroad and things like that? I know Amherst has tons of funding for these things (and help with the initial dorm stuff, coat, etc too), not sure about Dartmouth.<br>Career center at Amherst is very strong also, lots of programs, speakers, workshops etc.<br>I\u2019m sure you know engineering is out if you choose Amherst. CS or whatever else. Easy double major too, if you like, with no required distribution courses.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>I don\u2019t think the transfer to Thayer is automatically guaranteed for outside students in their 2-1-1-1 plan. Something to look in to.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gearmom</b><br><br>When I had said work hard, play hard for Dartmouth, I did not mean clean playing as in sports but alcohol and beer pong. You are 15 years old turning 16. Another con for Dartmouth is the isolation especially in winter. Amherst has plenty of great outdoors also.

I\u2019d be very careful about drawing conclusions about student culture, interaction, and \u201cseeming cool\u201d based solely on what you\u2019ve seen on paper. I\u2019ve met several African-American alumni from Dartmouth who will probably never contribute a dime to their annual fund because they were so disenchanted by their experience there. Your mileage may vary (YMMV), as they say on the net, but, the question of whether you have visited any of these schools needs to be cleared up.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gigichuck</b><br><br>@circuitrider No, no.

No I have never visited any of these schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gearmom</b><br><br>About age. 15 turning 16 or 16 turning 17 is another colloquialism. Sorry about that.

Please do note that the chair of the Board of Trustees is an African-American woman, as is the newly appointed vice president of alumni relations.<br>And frankly, the frat/party culture stuff is overplayed here too. There\u2019s a good percentage of students who aren\u2019t active in Greek life at all, and you should understand that not all frats are the same\u2013some are coed and very different from your typical image. Dartmouth students didn\u2019t get accepted to a school of this caliber by partying their brains out in high school. The difference between Dartmouth and some other schools is that frat parties are generally open to everyone, which makes it a much less exclusive and more welcoming atmosphere than the party scene for many other colleges.<br>As far as the OP not having visited, with admitted student Facebook groups and then group texts/chats that develop, students can get a good feel of who\u2019s in the class and make friends early.<br>So, one vote for Dartmouth, an astounding beautiful place with so much to offer. (But OP is right\u2013it\u2019s cold in the winter! Which is why the D Plan is a great thing.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: KeepItFair</b><br><br>Dartmouth has the better CS program.  Dr. Tom Cormen wrote the bible on Algorithms and teaches at Darmouth.  You will find many developers at Google, Amazon and Facebook who went to Dartmouth and the alumni network is very strong.  As for the climate? Does anyone think Amherst has a pleasant climate in the winter?  Dartmouth embraces winter and has their own ski mountain (and many Olympians).  And, if you change your mind, and no longer want to pursue CS, then Dartmouth has a world class connection to Wall Street.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Yeah I agree. Amherst is a big step down from Dartmouth academically. Not.<br>Just joking.<br>Both equally spectacular.<br>One is smaller<br>one is ivy brand known around the world<br>Amherst is known around the world by academics grad schools and sophisticated employers<br>Both sporty.<br>Both cold in winter.<br>Amherst is a bigger college town than Hanover but both with a nice vibe.<br>More students in general area in Amherst<br>5 college system in Amherst<br>Dartmouth offers the breadth/quality of offerings across disciplines unique to a university of its class<br>despite what you hear Dartmouth does have more of party/Greek life aspect than Amherst. But not that big of deal. It can be fun too.<br>You would find good friends at both schools.<br>Splitting hairs  At 16 soon to be 17 I would go to Dartmouth. Amherst will be a bit more serious and it\u2019s size will make it a bit harder for someone with your unique background and age to find your group.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gearmom</b><br><br>@KeepItFair Winter sports are expensive which will be a problem. Dartmouth certainly does embrace skiing but this family will be reaching to afford the 4K a year. There would be more to do in Amherst if you are priced out of winter sports. Is Wall Street a viable option for internationals?<br><br>", "<b>Username: gearmom</b><br><br>@gigichuck Has Dartmouth come back with a better financial offer yet?<br><br>", "<b>Username: gearmom</b><br><br>@privatebanker She just turned 16.

(I assume the shuttle and access passes are free to Dartmouth students).<br><br>", "<b>Username: gearmom</b><br><br>@gigichuck I just wanted to say that though it seems like a long time when you are young, maybe you should be leaving grad school on the table. 4 years at an elite college, OPT then elite grad school, OPT, would be an incredibly strong position and opportunity. Especially if you want to have a start up, you would make so many wonderful connections including financial ones to fund your dreams. I think that investors would be more inclined to stand behind you with valuable experience and grad school.<br>O\u2019k so if you go to Dartmouth (or even Amherst), when you go to a party be careful of what you drink. Don\u2019t put a drink down and then drink again from it. Someone could slip something into it.<br>For winter sports, consider cross country skiing as an affordable-ish option. You could get used skis.<br>@privatebanker Yes, incredible options. I said to her it is a choice between diamonds and pearls.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>@privatebanker : how does that reinforce your choice ? Genuinely curious.

Okay grad school is back on the table, on a tiny little corner close to the edge <br><br>", "<b>Username: gearmom</b><br><br>@gigichuck When you are older, you will miss this time in college. You could just send your transcript to Harvard and Princeton. Just for kicks  They might beg you to attend.

I mean, it is entirely possible that, as an international, the OP will be immune to the subtleties of American race relations (I\u2019m reminded of the SNL skit where the king of Wakanda visits \u201cBlack Jeopardy\u201d) and what a remark like that says about the state of play at Dartmouth. And at age 16 going on 17, it\u2019s perfectly possible she may find all of this squabbling between Americans rather amusing and nothing to do with her. But, four years is an awfully long time to bet that stuff like that won\u2019t get old.<br><br>", "<b>Username: TTdd16</b><br><br>@circuitrider, if you\u2019re attempting to generalize about race relations at Dartmouth based on a couple of alums you know who had bad experiences, then I think you\u2019re out of line. You\u2019re saying there aren\u2019t any Amherst alums of color who refuse to donate because of bad experiences? I mean, that\u2019s absurd. The stereotypes on this thread are also ridiculous. There are plenty of students at Dartmouth who choose not to drink at all and who have full, happy social lives. I don\u2019t think the drinking situation is much different from most other colleges.<br>As for winter sports, the Dartmouth Outing Club would certainly help students with gear\u2014there would be little to no cost to the joys of cross-country skiing on the golf course at night. And the wonders of the first snowfall or walking around Occom Pond on a sunny Sunday are perfectly free.<br>The OP has two amazing choices, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll do well wherever she decides. She really needs current students from both colleges to weigh in on the specifics she asked about. In the meantime, I wish CC posters without direct knowledge of a college would refrain from  perpetuating false stereotypes.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Hi @MYOS1634    I think at 16 you would need the larger student population to find a group.

Also if I were playing to an international market after school I would choose d<br>But that\u2019s just my two cents.

The administration took action to curb dangerous drinking at Dartmouth\u2013and I think the experiment is still too young to know how successful it\u2019s been. My understanding is that the reaction has been very mixed on campus. But you\u2019re seriously deriding an effort to do something about the issue of excessive underage drinking, something that exists on just about every campus in America?<br>As for the Review, it offers a hard-right perspective that\u2019s always represented a fraction of the student body and is held in contempt by the majority. That\u2019s been the case since it first formed in the early 80s, and certainly Dartmouth\u2019s student population has become decidedly more liberal since then. The D takes much more traditionally liberal positions. I happen to think publications with alternative viewpoints\u2013across the political spectrum\u2013are a good thing, but I object to the times that the Review has crossed the line over the years.<br>Once again, unless current students of color want to weigh in on the merits of Dartmouth vs Amherst, there\u2019s little point of continuing this back and forth.

I loved the Lord Jeff- Mammoth selection and transition process though, D was there through it. Very democratic, current students and alumni got a vote, the list of finalists came from a student generated list.
