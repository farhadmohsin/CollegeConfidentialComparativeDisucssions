If full ride means just tuition is covered, instead of $0, it is everything else you would need/expect to pay over 4 years.  Even if the debt at the end of 4 years is only $60k, the fact is there was another roughly $220k  (or whatever the final differential is vs Madison) spent that could have been saved.

All tuition is covered, all that would need to be payed is housing + gas money back to Minnesota. Minnesotans also gain reciprocity with Wisconsin, so if the scholarship is lost It would be roughly 30,000 a year. Yale would be around 70,000 a year with tuition, housing, and flights back to MN.

I wrote a whole mess of research papers (one 12-pager was written twice, when my floppy disk somehow didn\u2019t save it properly the first time\u2026 oh joy), about two-thirds of my non-STEM exams were essay- or case-based and the multiple choice exams were A-J/K/L rather than A-D. Granted, I had an active social life, and I could have worked harder, but I had a hard time earning A\u2019s there. UW does not seem interested in handing out A\u2019s that aren\u2019t earned. I was a 3.8, single-sitting uncoached 30 kid from northern Wisconsin, and for the first time in my life, I couldn\u2019t coast.

Yale is a proud school \u2013 they care about their grad rate, but they also care about their academic rep.<br>I have a dog in this race, but if everything else were even or nearly so, I would suggest Yale. But it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s six-figures not, and this kid wants to go to med school.<br>OP, UW is a blast.

But the money is all in the same pool Assuming that you + parents are out zero for UW Madison x 4 years vs being out $240,000 for going to Yale for 4 years, in what way is that affordable?<br>To put it in perspective, if you were to invest that amount of money (the 240K) at age 22 and earn 7% per year on average until you retire at age 65 you would be ahead $4.4 million! You are not likely going into medicine for the money, but money does matter. If you are a doctor and figuring out any job, any year, any change, etc. it will always matter to you.<br>Obviously, Yale is Yale. And $4.4 million in retirement is $4.4 million. That is more than most doctors have in savings when funding their own retirements after a career of work. If you have children or spouse for whom you want to provide in the future, the decision is simple. UW is a good school and offers a lot of opportunities. Wisconsin also has two medical schools in state.<br><br>", "<b>Username: oldfort</b><br><br>Every year we have similar discussion.  Yale\u2019s COA is 280K now.  The answer is different for every family, there is no clear answer.  My short answer above is based on what OP posted - parents could afford to pay their share and OP would come out with 60K loans.  I know so many students who have changed their mind about medical school.<br>My daughter was offered a full tuition at a 2nd tier LAC.  I also had a hard time to walk away from 40K/yr back then, but It was my daughter who said she would be willing to borrow 10k/yr from me to go to an Ivy.  I also thought about what we could do with 200K.  I decided the ROI on my D could be much higher than if I\u2019ve put it in any other investment.<br>There is a discussion on the Parent Forum about if it matters what school your kid goes to, maybe it is worth a read.  From my personal experience, it does matter and it matters more than just the first job.  My older daughter is making top 1% salary at an age of 27 and my younger daughter is finishing up a 2 year internship where they only hired from Ivies and Stanford.  I think her internship helped her greatly in getting into a top 4-5 law school.  We are again at a crossroad of be a full pay at that top law school or take the scholarship from a lower ranking law school.  A very good friend of D2 was just offered an assistant editor job at a major newspaper.  He also went to a top ranking school.  The competition was fierce because the job paid over 70K with benefits.  They had a lot of applicants and they had to use some filters to limit number of people they wanted to interview.<br>If your parents are liquidating their 401K or emptying out all of their savings acct to pay for Yale then your family can\u2019t afford it.  On the other hand, if your parents had put away money and planned on paying for your college (maybe in state), then I wouldn\u2019t miss out on the opportunity of going to Yale.

If, however, the prospects of med school are not so certain, the calculus does change somewhat.  Then it is a question of what Madison offers as likely alternatives to Yale in other departments/interests both academically and student life-wise.  Here we have 2 very different institutions.  The OP may thrive in both or one may offer a superior fit vs. the other.  Besides money, we have to consider the value of the experience for 4 very critical years that OP can never get back.<br>I shared a personal anecdote on another similar thread involving Georgia Tech vs Harvard.  My brother chose to go to an honors program of a top public institution.  He ended up at a great med school and then on to residency at one of the top programs in his specialty.  He is very successful and happy.  He wanted to be a doctor from childhood. However, I am only aware of one friend of his from undergrad that he maintains regular contact with. I, on the other hand, had no clue what I wanted to do/be entering college.  I did not decide on a major until junior year.  Going to law school was almost a default.  My closest friends these days though are predominantly my buddies from Yale.  About a dozen of us still take an annual boys\u2019 long weekend trip each year.

To begin with, over the course of a succesful career in medicine, 60,000 is effectively meaningless.  Just do the math of lifetime earnings of a physician.  To turn down a superior opportunity over 60,000 is poor thinking.  So, is Yale superior?  The posters keep saying it doesn\u2019t matter where you go undergraduate for med school admissions, but that is absolutely false.  Yale, as a matter of fact, gets a higher percentage of students, at a lower GPA, then Madison into medical school.  Medical school admission rates are as low as Stanford and Harvard for undergraduate.  Wouldn\u2019t you want every advantage.  And to suggest that because people at Yale are smarter than people at Madison that your grades will be lower proportionately, is also not factual.  Top schools are known for grade inflation and helping students.  And Madison has many talented students in pre-med.  The idea that you can breeze through pre-med weed out courses at Madision and would struggle at Yale is simply guess work.  But the flawed nature of the advice, even from a financial perspective, comes out when you take a closer look at med school admissions and merit aid.  Top med schools also have better financial aid and better MERIT aid.  If you do well at Yale, you will be much more likely to be accepted at a top medical school with better aid and medical school is much much more expensive than undergraduate.  And if you want MERIT aid for medical school, you better be a top top applicant.  Now, if the amount is 240,000, that is different story because then you may end up borrowing on top of that amount for medical school, and that total number will balloon. I am not knocking Madison at all.  Great school.  But the poor advice here needs to be addressed.<br><br>", "<b>Username: starwars1</b><br><br>But it would be kind of a shame to lose the opportunity to go to Yale, when there are tens of thousands of kids out there with Yale being their dream school, who aren\u2019t accepted and can never attend.  As a doctor, especially if you end up specializing, that 60K plus the cost of med school really wouldn\u2019t be a terrible burden.  You most likely will be able to pay if off a few years into your practice.  But if you intend to go into academic medicine or just do family practice, then financially it might become a bit tight.  Yale is a brand name giving you opportunities to open up a lot of doors.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>It\u2019s not just 60k its that plus 200k for med school.

Medical school is running closer to 80,000 a year or more.

That is leaving aside the fact, left out of the advice here, that medical school admission rates at less than elite medical schools are running around 5% and even very strong students are being rejected.

But 60k is a lot to pay for that. . .<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>AlmostThere, a constant theme of CC is unrealistic expectations.  Lots of good students expect to get admitted to, pick your school, but dont think seriously about 8 or 9 % admission rate.  A medical school with an 8 or 9 % admission rate is a \u201cnon selective\u201d school, relatively speaking. George Washington Medical school, for example, had an under 3% admission rate.   And they are picking those 8 or 9 %  or 3% out of a carefully cultivated group of high achieving students.  That is, getting into medical school is just like getting into Ivy League caliber schools and now requires the same resume building stuff for undergraduate but ramped up, research, community service, recommendations.  Telling someone whose dream is medical school to give up the advantage that Yale offers for admission in terms of reputations, personalized attention, and research opportunity to save 60,000 is poor advice, IMHO.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hapworth</b><br><br>As the majority of posters have written, UW-Madison.<br>OP, the only thing that\u2019s tugging at you is the brand name of Yale.  Funny thing about college choice: it is both a significant but a not-so-really life-altering decision as people think.  The decision about where to attend seems bigger than it really is.  For instance, many, many students wish they could be in your shoes and attend Madison.<br>Another issue, and I hope this isn\u2019t too personal.  But if you are expected to pay full freight at Yale, this means that your family is full pay.  I understand that some full pay families are right on the bubble, expected to cover the complete COA even though a family might feel that this is beyond their means.  However, if I am reading things right, your family is willing to pay 220K towards your Yale education, and you are expected to handle the remaining 60K?<br>Question: why aren\u2019t you or your parents suggesting what strikes me as the obvious?  \u201cSon (or dear daughter), you will attend UW-Madison, and we will finance your medical school costs up to 220K.\u201d  In other words, if medical school is in your future, why spend so much of everyone\u2019s money (yours (in the form of future debt) and your parents\u2019) on undergrad?  Am I missing something?<br>If your family could comfortably afford Yale, that would be different.  If the debt were lower (let\u2019s say 30K, which many students do take on; debt is the reality for most college students), maybe that would change things, too (even though I don\u2019t think Yale is worth 30K in debt, not when the other option is practically free).  I wish you the best, though.<br><br>", "<b>Username: starwars1</b><br><br>The 200K is presumably constant despite whatever undergrad one attends.   So would you go to Yale with 260K debt or to Madison with 200K debt?  Not much of a difference in the grand scheme.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@manyloyalties   I think Yale is worth the investment. In nearly all instances  But for medical school applications many top med schools love the stars coming out of state flagships. If the kid is this bright, I would be surprised if they weren\u2019t uber elite at their flagship and get into the better med school. I think top undergrad school Yale coupled with inexpensive but good med school is less valuable long term tha. UW coupled with a top 15 med school. When discussing your dr do you mention wher they went undergrad or med school. For me it may not even come up where they ent undergrad.<br>But it\u2019s no mistake going to Yale of course. It\u2019s Yale. And for all the obvious reasons. But I do believe that people underestimate the quality of education and guidance available at a school like UW.<br>I would go to Yale myself. But I\u2019m not writing the checks So it\u2019s  easy for me to say.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Midwestmomofboys</b><br><br>Re-read the posts, may have missed some still but \u2013 OP says they have to personally borrow $15 a year , as a student, to get through Yale, and family will struggle but manage the rest of the cost of full pay at Yale. The alternative is full tuition award at Madison, so costs are room and board, books, travel to MN which would be about $12-15k a year, total. If the med school goal is unwavering and committed, then UW seems the only affordable option (and a great one at that). OP cannot borrow $15k a year personally, and it sounds like family paying the remainder of full pay at Yale may well involve debt, since OP says it will be a struggle. Substantial debt for undergrad or using family resources for undergrad which could be preserved to contribute to med school, just does not make sense. And, if the merit award at UW includes any perks \u2013 research access etc., so much the better. If not, OP should apply to participate in the UW undergrad research scholars program, which gets freshman and sophomores teamed up with faculty research.<br>If a student were saying Wall Street/finance/ consulting \u2013 then yes, Yale could make sense, as that name opens doors. But med school? no.<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>Madison is a great school and its stars will do well.  On the overall scale, going to Madison to go to medical school is a fine choice.  But this is a comparative question and the posters who say going to Madison is the \u201ceasy\u201d choice, or that 60k in debt is too much are simply ignoring the exceptionally low admission rates to medical school now and the possible financial benefits to being a top applicant.  The facts are simple:  as strong a school as Madison is, going to to Yale provides a far better opportunity for admission and for medical school money.  I will pick an easy example.  Baylor is a great medical school and very very affordable.  If you get into Baylor, you will save 200k in debt for medical school.  Getting in is very very hard with incredible competition.  You have a much better shot of getting into Baylor from Yale than Madison.  Case Western has a FREE, five year medical school.  You have a much better chance of getting into the free top medical school from Yale than Madison.  And, I\u2019ll say it again, you can\u2019t simply go to class, get good grades take the MCAT\u2019s and get into medical school now anymore than you can go to high school, get good grades, take the SAT\u2019s and go to Dartmouth.  You need a four year, programmed, organized, supported effort including research, community service, recommendation letters and top grades and test scores.  That grueling process is much more likely to result in admission from Yale than Madison.  Again, not knocking Madison, but if your dream is medical school, and you want to lower the cost of medical school, going to Yale and investing 60,000 is the easiest of easy choices.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>They might not have the 60k period.  And I politely disagree that high gpa high mcat score student from uw with research has any disadvantage to Yale. The same scores perhaps a little. It\u2019s just not the current experience. More students at Yale are bright enough to get into med school so more will go. UF Sent the 2nd most students get into med school last year nationally. As an example. Yale  will have better support in general and is a more prestigious undergrad. If you don\u2019t end up going to med school as the vast majority end up deciding the Yale degree means more over time. Assuredly.<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>Im not knocking Madison, and the state flagships do well.  But at 3% admission rates mean that even slight advantages have a great impact on the outcome.  And I don\u2019t mean \u201cprestige\u201d in the abstract, I mean the opportunities, professors, and support.  Log onto the pages of the top medical schools and see where the students come from, Yale is always well represented.  I didn\u2019t go to Yale, or Madison, and like both schools.  But I don\u2019t think reasonable people can disagree that Yale outperforms Madison in medical school placement, with greater margin for error in grades, better research opportunities, and more personalized support.  The question is, is that worth 60,000 when you can earn far more than 60,000 in reduced medical school cost and a better chance of admission.  It seems to me that it absolutely is.  If they don\u2019t have it all, then why pose the question.  Life doesn\u2019t always give easy or obvious choices.  Borrowing the 60,000 has some element of risk, with a great benefit, personal and financial.  Not borrowing, has other risks, such as more expensive medical school, maybe no medical school, or a school you don\u2019t want to go to.  Or, if you switch careers, less opportunity.  I just think measured against the posters overall earning capability and in light of ambitious goals, aiming high is the right way to go.<br><br>", "<b>Username: starwars1</b><br><br>Most kids entering college as a premed do not stick to their plan.  Either they find something better, or the premed course work is way too difficult.  Coming out of Yale, again, will open up a lot of doors and resources for your other options.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hapworth</b><br><br>Okay, @manyloyalties makes some strong points (BTW, did you go to medical school?  Not being argumentative.  If not, it sounds like you still know a lot, much more than an English major like me  ).<br>But shouldn\u2019t we bring up the unmentioned (or it probably is mentioned, but there are so many posts in this thread!)?  We all know that the ground is littered with the bones of once-hopeful pre-med students.  We all personally know friends, family members, and classmates who started out pre-med but switched to another \u201cmajor\u201d (pre-med, of course, is not a major).  One friend of mine who attended UIUC became pre-law.  My roommate in college went to dental school.<br>Clearly, the OP is bright; otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have been admitted to Yale.  Any idea how many Yalies get weeded out?  I\u2019m not questioning the OP\u2019s devotion or desire, but if medical school at some point is not an option, what should he do?  Is Yale still worth the 60K (plus his family\u2019s substantial payment) because it can open doors?  If the OP\u2019s plan is to immediately enter the job market, maybe?  The starting salaries from top schools are higher (don\u2019t worry, people, the other grads from other schools catch up over time).  Also, there\u2019s the trend (disturbing, IMO) of how Wall Street poaches all sorts of Ivy grads (not just economics grads) for two years of grueling but well-paid work.  These students get run through the mill, working 80+ hours per week, and essentially lose two years of their lives and often regret the decision after.  But they do get paid a bundle.<br>If med school does not pan out, Madison is perhaps the stronger choice if the OP plans to go to grad school, which is far less dependent on the name of the undergrad institution.  He can get into a top STEM grad school program via Madison or New Haven.<br>Thoughts?<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>I did not go to medical school, but several family members did, and applied recently, and so I learned all about the frenzy of medical school admissions, which continue to be absurdly brutally competitive in ways that make college admissions seem like child\u2019s play.  Twenty or more applications to schools with 3% admissions, costs of 80,000 a year and rising.  Paying for medical school is no joke and by then family resources are long gone, even though medical schools require consideration of those same resources.  And, as with undergraduate, the best medical schools have the most need and merit aid, so getting into the top schools is a cheaper option in many cases, which makes those schools even harder to get into.  That being said, who knows about switching careers.  No choices are that simple but you can\u2019t go wrong with either Madison or Yale on an absolute scale.  Yale is better if you wanted to go to Wall Street and Madison is better for a lower paid career, I assume.    The Poster is in good shape.  I guess my point overall is that the 60,000 can\u2019t be considered without also considering the impact on medical school admissions and cost.<br><br>", "<b>Username: AlmostThere2018</b><br><br>@DecisionHelp - what did you decide?
