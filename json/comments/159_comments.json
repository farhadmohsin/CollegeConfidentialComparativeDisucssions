RPI and Case will have similar weather. One great thing about Cornell engineering is that it is 50% female, which is unusual for an engineering school. My D is a freshman MechE major at Cornell and absolutely loves it.  Cornell has so many opportunities to get involved, especially for engineers. She is heavily involved in one of the big project teams, which had given her a great network of friends from all years, as well as real hands-on engineering training.  Cornell has a very strong alumni network as well, especially in the NY area.  I\u2019m an alum myself, and spend a lot of time mentoring recent Cornell grads who want to go into my field. D also looked at RPI but was wary of the lopsided gender ratio, and its extreme tech focus (even the \"liberal arts\u2019 requirements are tech classes).  I don\u2019t know much about VaTech. $30K is a big chunk of money though - only you can decide whether it will be worth it.<br>Edit -  Is that $30K total or $30K per year?

VT has a very large Career Fair. There are  detailed post grad surveys available  online and VT engineers are very well recruited by many different companies. Of course, Cornell is an excellent choice as well. Any of these schools will provide an excellent education.

I feel like your post is directed right for us.  Background: S\u2019s grandfather went to Cornell for CE.  Other grandfather went to VT for ME.  Father went to VT for ME and Mom for business.  Some of his good friends are going to UMD.  He has been accepted to Cornell, RPI, VT, and UMD with merit/honors recognition at all except Cornell.  Cornell COA $72k, VT and RPI $40k, UMD $22k per year.  We have visited all schools.  Everything everyone says about the individual schools above is true.<br>Sounds like your D is not that into Cornell or RPI.  Then it should be a no brainer for her; Case or VT.  It sounds like if she went to Cornell or RPI; it would be for the benefit of her Dad and not her choice. My S is still figuring it out, but he has no issues admitting VT is the prettiest campus out of all of them\u2026including Cornell.  Cornell has the \u201cold feel\u201d to it and it is definitely pretty, but for him the Hokie Stone everywhere is awesome and the dining halls are incredible.  If she is an outdoors person, VT is a wonderful place.<br>I would suggest saving your money for undergaduate (especially if that is where she is leaning) and have her apply to Yale for graduate work\u2026all that would be less than 4-yrs at Cornell.  That is likely what my S will do.  I have this feeling he will stay IS and go to UMD and get a great degree in engineering.  He has always been a more urban/metro area type anyway.  Then if he can prove himself, he will apply for grad school at Columbia/Berkeley/etc.  Again urban type.<br>I dunno but for me 4-yr UMD/VT and 2-yr Columbia/Yale is &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4-yr Cornell and potentially STILL LESS $$$.<br><br>", "<b>Username: LuckyCharms913</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>None of us have seen Case.

Visit with both parents, if you can bring or arrange coverage at home for your 10 year old; otherwise just one parent will do. Leave on Sunday morning, share the driving, have dinner in the Italian area close to Case, maybe drive around Cleveland, which is an interesting city. Stay overnight, visit Case the next morning. You can be back on the road by 12:30 and home before 10 PM. It\u2019s a fine school and worth it to visit IF the extra $10,000/year isn\u2019t a deal breaker. If she decides on VT, which is also a fine choice for engineering, you are right that she\u2019s \u201cchoosing\u201d it.

Even if that latter part weren\u2019t true, I can\u2019t fathom making a youngster go somewhere they don\u2019t like unless it absolutely had to be done because of finances (being less expensive).<br>Again, it\u2019s her life and VT is a terrific option.

It is usually the teenager that is pushing for the more expensive, elite school!  Not the parent.

Cornell wasn\u2019t her dream school, but she was warming up to the idea of going to an Ivy that wasn\u2019t Yale. But she still wanted to see Tech.<br>Ok, so we went back to VT. Cornell is this coming weekend. And this much is now clear:<br>It isn\u2019t really about the school for her at all. She is a little stressed about choosing because choosing means leaving home, and she is only 17 still. She is a little scared. So NO choice feels exciting right now.<br>But she really does<br>Like VT. And Dad, having seen it, sat in on the engineering sessions,  and researched the heck out of it, is more than pleased. She will LIKELY decide on her own that VT is the right place - but she wants to see Cornell first. Because she got in. And, she wants us to spend a little more time with her maybe. But she is more a cooperative person than a competitive person, and everyone at VT was just so NICE. I mean, everyone, down to the couple at the next table who were alumni and spent their whole dinner talking to us. The girl who introduced herself to us after overhearing our conversation, and offered her dorm room for a tour and a cell number in case we had any questions. And more.

Income was also slightly less since I stopped working mid year (disabled younger child, a different story) and 529 had been drawn down a bit. We did not understand that it was the EFC per CHILD. Because I do the laundry at my house and I haven\u2019t noticed $140,000 falling out of anyone\u2019s pockets, we didn\u2019t realize what we were getting into.
