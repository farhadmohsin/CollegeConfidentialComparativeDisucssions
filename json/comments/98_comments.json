I am obviously very biased in favor of Brown and admit that. Still...this is my op of the difference FWIW.<br><br>There's no one social scene at Brown. There's no pecking order. Sure, there are some outstanding students whom everyone knows, but there isn't an \"in\" or and \"out\" <b><i>group. </i></b> There are lots of different social scenes going on at the same time. There really isn't a single typical Brown \"social experience.\"<br><br>Duke has the \"400.\" I THINK that's the number. The Greek system is strong --MUCH stronger than at Brown.There's a pecking order for frats and sororities. While, of course, there are tons of students who have no desire to join a frat or sorority and just don't care, there is an \"in crowd.\"<br><br>One of the ramifications of this--at least I THINK it's a result of the Greek scene--is that Duke women dress up a LOT more than Brown women for day to day life, like going to classes. Roll out of bed, grab jeans from floor, race to class is fine at Brown but would make a female a little \"odd\" at Duke. On the flip side, if you like wearing mascara and lipstick to your 8 am classes, you'd probably seem a little \"odd\" at Brown. ( I just googled trying to find a link to the 400 thing and found this: <a href=\"http://web.duke.edu/womens_initiative/report_report.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Duke's Women's Initiative -Duke University</a> See the part under the heading Undergraduate students. It's good to know Duke is aware of the situation and maybe I'm way out of date, but I don't think so. )<br><br>Brown's strong in the arts. The theatre program is excellent. A capella is popular. Visual arts are really, really strong--especially due to the RISD connection. Spectator sports matter a bit, but not that much. Athletes don't get an automatic \"pass,\" academically or socially.<br><br>Duke's pretty weak in the arts--at least in the sense of other students paying any attention to them. (My kid couldn't find a single tour guide who had ever attended an undergrad theatre production at Duke.) Duke basketball is, of course, very strong. The strength of the team leads to a RAH-RAH sense of communitythat Brown lacks--and frankly most Brown students are GLAD it lacks-- but many undergrads really enjoy. Jocks rule. It's sort of like a lot of American high schools where jocks are at the top of the social ladder automatically.<br><br>Supposedly, <i>I Am Charlotte Simmons</i> by Tom Wolfe is based more on Duke than any other college. (His daughter was a student there.) The book doesn't describe Brown. Oh Brown has just as much booze and drugs and sex as Duke does, I'm sure. But the role of the frats and the sports teams and the newspaper staff in the book is just not at all like Brown.<br><br>Again, I'm biased and admit that. I just think the social scenes are very very different. If you like RAH-RAH and think joining a frat or sorority would be great--and lots of people do--then Duke's the school for you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: iamtbh</b><br><br>\"\"<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/profile/knat\">knat</a> wrote:\"\"<br><br><br>Actually, Brown and Duke have a lot more in common than you think:<br><br><a href=\"http://www.projo.com/education/content/projo_20060917_brown917.327aa8d.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Education | projo.com | The Providence Journal</a><br><br>", "<b>Username: modestmelody</b><br><br>The whole celebrity thing is pretty much over blown nonsense based on one book that's basically just one guy's opinion:<br><a href=\"http://www.browndailyherald.com/is-brown-s-popularity-a-passing-trend-or-here-to-stay-1.2230594\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Brown Daily Herald - Is Brown's popularity a passing trend or here to stay?</a><br><br>We're not any better or worse on this issue than most other top schools, but for some reason people freak out about it more.

But prospectives: in the end, your anxiety won't be worth it. Unless two schools are radically different (which Duke and Brown are not), then the only things that will prevent you from enjoying your college experience are your own personal inadequacies. And don't give me any bull about anyone not having any doubts about their school. Regardless of how much we love our schools, we can all name 10 things that we'd change.
