If you decide to go there I might see you around since I live in Palo Alto, but go to Berkeley.<br><br>I'm not sure if you visited either school yet, but I'll give my comments about the quality of life in Berkeley and Palo Alto.<br><br>Palo Alto:<br>A moderate sized suburban city located in Silicon Valley. Although located right next to Stanford, Palo Alto is NOT a college town. Everything from housing to dining is expensive in this town. Many restaurants in downtown Palo Alto are reservation-required and formal dress only. An average dinner bill of $40-80 per person is anything but surprising. The housing meltdown has not even touched Palo Alto... the average median home price is $1.6 million and still climbing. Good reasons why 96% of Stanford students decide to stay on campus.<br><br>Transportation without a car in suburbia will be difficult. Stanford provides a local bus service, but only goes so far. My friends at Stanford said they rely upon upperclassmen to carpool to entertainment and other activities in adjacent cities such as Mountain View/Menlo Park.<br><br>Stanford knows how Palo Alto is lacking in needs for college students, so the University provides many of the essential services Stanford students will need.<br><br>In all the years I've lived in Palo Alto what I've noticed is the small amount of crime. Violent crimes (murders, rapes, assaults) are very rare in Palo Alto. Petty crimes are common though, so locking doors and not going down dark alleys is still recommended. Homeless people do not venture onto the Stanford campus, but still have a presence in downtown Palo Alto.<br><br>Berkeley:<br>It's urban, so the roads and sidewalks have more cracks and potholes than Palo Alto. Compared to Palo Alto, homelessness has a heavy presence on campus and on Southside. But as an urban area, public transportation is more frequent and goes more places.<br><br>Crime can be common in Berkeley... armed robberies, rapes, assaults, and generally more violent crimes occur. Common sense about safety can prevent this. Just don't withdraw ATM money at 3am or walk through People's Park at night and you'll mitigate your chances as a victim of crime.<br><br>A lot of stores and eateries cater to college students in Berkeley. With most dorms located off-campus and in Berkeley, students end up shopping and eating more at local businesses. So there's definitely a college town for Berkeley.<br><br>Whatever school you end up going to I hope you enjoy your college experience. Best of luck for your academic and future career!<br><br>", "<b>Username: undecided</b><br><br>Berkeley is an urban college town. Stanford/Palo Alto is not. Pretty much anything else I say about either campus boils down to this.<br><br>Berkeley is massively overrun with students, and their interests take center stage for much of the immediate area. There are plenty of venues for cheap, late night food. Life on campus can be exciting, but there's easy access to options off campus as well. The BART station is a couple blocks from one side of the university, and with it you can get to SF and most other major parts of the Bay Area for relatively cheap (it's about ~$7 to go to SF and back).<br><br>Stanford is a private university and my experience with it lead me to believe it's run a lot more like a country club than a university. The campus is beautiful in an almost Stepford Wife-ian way (the lawns are immaculate and green, the architecture is clean and updated and uniform or else complementary -- and honestly? it's a good thing, it just gave me the creeps sometimes). The campus is also HUGE and a little spread out, so a bike is a good idea and well supported with bike racks and roads. You can get to SF, but it involves a bit of a walk to the CalTrain. I vaguely recall that the walk + train ride took a lot longer, but then that makes sense since it's over twice as far away as Berkeley is.<br><br>Stanford knows that Palo Alto is not exactly a student's dream town, so a lot of the activities happen on campus. The summer camp-y feel actually makes it really easy to get cosy with your fellow students, and with nothing better to do, you might find yourself joining a lot more activities than you had planned. Berkeley is much more for the self-motivated and independent student, as it takes constant drive to get yourself involved in things.<br><br>I think the basic difference comes down to this: do you like the city or the country?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Castel</b><br><br>For computer science, sadly, Stanford is better than Berkeley.

Hence, I think you meant to say that San Jose/Silicon Valley has a lot of tech startups - in fact, arguably the greatest such concentration of entire world. Let's face it. Silicon Valley is the world's preeminent dynamo of high-tech entrepreneurship. Nowhere else is even close.<br>\"\"but if you want long-term jobs, Palo Alto appears to be a more convenient location\"\"<br><br>Ha! If anything, I would actually argue that the opposite is true - that <i>San Francisco</i> is probably a better place to find long-term stable jobs compared to Silicon Valley, simply due to the large profusion of relatively stable firms in financial services, retail, tourism, media, etc. - all of which are more stable than high-tech startups, most of which will die. {Not that that really matters, because if your Silicon Valley startup dies, who cares, you just join another one, as startups are constantly being created in Silicon Valley all the time.}<br>\"\"Trust me, in the industry, a EECS from UCB is far superior to one from Stanford...<br>rankings, corporate hiring, etc etc all CLEARLY reflect that...<br>go bears\"\"<br><br>I'm with Student on this one, in that I would dearly love to see a source that states that rankings \"clearly\" reflect that Berkeley EECS is better than Stanford EE/CS. If anything, the rankings show that they are either tied or that Stanford is (slightly) ahead.<br>\"\"Many of the top tech companies come to Berkeley to recruit. They even charter bus to drive Berkeley students to their campus, provide entertainments and offer jobs to Berkeley students in horde.\"\"<br><br>Nobody is saying that Berkeley is a <i>bad</i> place to go. Indeed, Berkeley is undoubtedly one of the very best places to be for EECS. The career prospects are indeed excellent.<br><br>But that's not the question on the table. The question on the table is, is it better to go to Berkeley rather than Stanford for EECS? To that, I would probably have to say that the edge goes to Stanford. That doesn't make Berkeley bad. It just mean that Stanford seems to have the edge.<br>\"\"In most companies in the SV, the number of Berkeley graduates = number of Stanford graduates. Salary range are about the same for both school.\"\"<br><br>I'm not sure it's really true that the number of Berkeley grads = the number of Stanford grads in most SV companies, but even it if were true, I doubt that that's a point in favor of Berkeley, given the vastly larger population of Berkeley students compared to Stanford students. Berkeley people ought to be <i>dominating</i> SV due to its sheer size alone, and if the ratios are actually even, then I would actually say that that shows that Stanford is the better choice.<br><br>But more importantly, I strongly suspect that the ratios are not even, and if anything, are almost certainly weighted in favor of Stanford. This is, again, due to the heavy startup activity that characterizes Silicon Valley. The fact is, the vast majority of startups don't engage in formal hiring practices, because they can't. When your company is just 2 guys in a garage somewhere, you don't have the time or resources to engage in a deep and formal talent search. Instead, you just end up hiring your friends, because that's really all you can do. For example, much (probably most) of the early engineering team at Google were basically old Stanford buddies of Larry and Sergey. Much of the early team at Yahoo were old Stanford buddies of Jerry and David. Much of the early team at Cisco were old buddies of Len and Sandy.<br><br>Now, were all these guys really 'the best' engineers available? Almost certainly not. I'm sure that somewhere out there in the world including, yes, around Berkeley - there were probably quite a few engineers who were better than some of the early guys hired at Google. But that didn't matter, <i>because the latter guys happened to know Larry or Sergey and the former guys did not</i>. Hence, the former guys never even had the chance to get the job. The same can be said for the other firms mentioned. And clearly, getting in early is <i>precisely</i> when you want to get into these companies.  Those early Google engineers are all multi-millionaires now from the IPO stock options. You're not going to become a millionaire by joining Google <i>now</i>.<br><br>I think a far more interesting question from a public policy/macroeconomic standpoint is why did Silicon Valley grow up around Stanford rather than Berkeley? To that question, quite a bit of ink has been spilt, most notably by Saxenian and other sociologists. But what is undeniable is the fact that more entrepreneurship occurs around Stanford than around Berkeley.<br>\"\"I think it boils down to the quality of life criteria. In that sense, I prefer Stanford. But this will vary greatly from person to person. Some people can't stand the stagnant suburbs of Palo Alto (though I like it). Others find Berkeley far more vivid and interesting.\"\"<br><br>To this, I agree. It does boil down to a matter of quality of life, and the city of Berkeley is a much more interesting city for a college student than is Palo Alto (but, frankly, that's not saying much, as Palo Alto is arguably the most boring college town in the country).<br><br>But I would say that the QoL issue extends beyond just the environs of the town. It is my opinion (and shared by many others) that Berkeley EECS/CS is simply too hard. It's too hard in general, and it's too hard relative to Stanford. By that, I mean that Stanford offers a far more forgiving environment for CS. It's still quite difficult to get A's, but as long as you do the work, you're basically assured of passing. The same cannot be said of Berkeley.<br><br>Now, some of you will surely be thinking that that extra rigor must be a point in favor of Berkeley. To that, I would have to emphatically disagree. The truth is, the extra rigor is simply not necessary. Employers don't value it, and neither do grad schools. Stanford CS grads seem to suffer from no disadvantage relative to Berkeley CS grads when it comes to employment and grad school admissions, despite the 'less rigorous' program. As one Berkeley EECS grad once told me, the program forces you to consume time learning things that you don't really need to know and that don't help you in your career.<br><br>{In fact, perhaps this is one reason why Silicon Valley was fostered around Stanford rather than Berkeley - as Stanford students spend less time having to learn things they don't need to know, and hence have more time to accomplish things that are actually practical, like starting companies.}<br><br>", "<b>Username: jlm382</b><br><br>Thanks for the input!

The ones that remain can still snag him.<br><br>The very fact that he is coming in as a transfer will make Cal <i>more</i> dangerous, not less, for several reasons. One, he can't build up a 'reservoir' of relatively easy lower-division non-EECS classes to use as a GPA buffer the way that freshman-admits can. To graduate from Berkeley, you need a 2.0 GPA <i>in your classes at Berkeley</i>. Having top grades from your other school doesn't help you fulfill that requirement. Hence, if you transfer to Berkeley and you get a bunch of C's and C-'s in your first semester, <i>you'll be immediately placed on academic probation</i> because your Berkeley GPA will already be below a 2.0, and hence you'll be close to expulsion. On the other hand, those students who had come in as freshmen had the opportunity to take a bunch of easier breadth requirements that will pump up their GPA. {Heck, I know an EECS student who avoided expulsion only because he had high grades in a bunch of Spanish courses, and that kept him over the 2.0 threshold.}<br><br>Secondly, and even more importantly, Berkeley has strict limits about how much time you are allowed to be there - far stricter than Stanford does. Hence, if the OP comes to Berkeley and then finds out that he doesn't want to major in CS after all (or finds out that it's just too hard), then he will have to present an action plan regarding what he will now major in and how he plans to graduate in a timely fashion. Stanford seems to be significantly more lenient about people who want to take extra time to graduate.<br>\"\"Actually Stanford has a lot more students in EE/CS than Berkeley.

However, the converse doesn't work in the sense that its almost impossible to be admitted to Stanford twice; last yrs' admission rate is &lt;2%(this yr it could be even lower). Making it twice reminds me of the futileness of expecting to win the lottery again after having won it once.<br><br>", "<b>Username: vc08</b><br><br>^^i can't tell if you're being sarcastic or serious.<br><br>When was Berkeley a \"fairly easy\" school to be admitted to?<br><br>", "<b>Username: student14x</b><br><br>Because all one needs to have is a 3.7+ gpa from a JC to transfer into Cal.

The truth is, most companies are <i>not</i> \"made up of engineers from a lot of lower-tier schools\", for the simple reason that most companies (in SV) are <i>startups</i>. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of startups in the Valley, with new ones being founded every week. Like I said, most startups don't have formal hiring practices because they can't. After all, when you're still just two guys in a garage somewhere, you don't have the time or expertise to run a formal hiring screen. At that stage, you end up hiring through your social network, i.e. your friends, something that has been documented time and time again by numerous researchers (i.e. Saxenian). Social networks are, far and away, the most prominent method that startups use to hire.<br><br>Furthermore, it is (sadly) indisputable that, for various reasons, there is more entrepreneurial activity around Stanford than around Berkeley. The upshot is that Stanford engineers have greater opportunity to join startups than do Berkeley students via social networks. The Berkeley engineer may be just as good, or even better, than the Stanford engineer, but that doesn't matter if he doesn't even <i>know</i> about the startup when it is young, which is <i>precisely</i> when you want to join a startup. Certainly, the early employees of Google - the bulk of whom were Stanford buddies of Sergey or Larry - aren't complaining.

How many startups actually made it?\"\"<br><br>Actually, working for a startup almost certainly pays <i>better</i>, on average. As Paul Graham said:<br><br><i>While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail, the one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times what they would have made in an ordinary job. That's the sense in which startups pay better \"on average.\"</i><br><br><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/marginal.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Power of the Marginal</a><br><br>That holds not just for founders, but also for early employees. For example, the early engineers at Google are easily worth in the in the 9 figures if they had held onto their stock options, maybe even in the 10 figures. After all, with Google now having a total market cap of nearly $200 billion, even holding 0.5% of the equity of the company - which the early engineers could each have easily received - would be worth $1 billion.<br><br>Now of course, clearly not everybody is lucky enough to choose Google. But even if there were 1000 total competing search engines and 999 of them completely failed and Google was the only 1 that succeeded, that would mean that the average stock option payout would be $1 million. Remember - that's just from the stock options; it's <i>on top</i> of the salary that you would also be paid once the company is investor-funded (and Google and others were funded quite quickly). Furthermore, there weren't 1000 competing search engines out there. Not even close. In fact, probably no more than 100.<br><br>I would also dispute the notion that you are really working longer hours at startups. What - you think you're not working at long hours at established companies? Trust me, engineers at Microsoft, Intel, (now) Google, and these other big firms work pretty darn long hours. The major difference is that they don't have a chance to become filthy rich. The days of hypergrowth of those firms is long gone.<br><br>Lower salaries and benefits are also a point of contention. In my personal experience, startups actually paid <i>the most</i>: often times nearly twice or (in one case) nearly three times what established firms were paying in salary, without even talking about the stock options. That's because when a startup is looking to expand and compete quickly (i.e. when they've just received a large infusion of VC cash and are looking to ramp up fast), one of the most effective ways to do so is to simply overpay salaries to attract people. For example, during the dotcom boom, there was one firm that literally didn't pay any of the technical staff less than $120k <i>just to start</i>, and this was back in 2000 dollars. There were guys fresh out of school who were immediately being appointed to Vice President and Director positions. Heck, one guy hadn't even graduated from college at all yet was offered a Director position. You never have that in established firms.<br><br>I think what you mean to say is that the startup lifestyle is <i>riskier</i> in that while the average outcome of joining a startup is clearly better than that of joining an established firm, the <i>variance</i> of the outcome is also far higher. You can end up filthy rich. Or you can end up with nothing as the company goes bankrupt. That is true.<br><br>But to that, I have 2 responses: First, let's not pretend that established firms don't have risk. Since you mentioned AMD, let's talk about AMD. Last month, AMD announced they were going to lay off 10% of its staff. Similarly, Intel instituted layoffs in each of the last few years, and may institute another round this year. Oracle has bought numerous large software companies in the last 5 years and after each acquisition has followed a large-scale layoff. If Microsoft and Yahoo had successfully merged, then that would have also meant big layoffs. Hence, we shouldn't kid ourselves into thinking that working for a large company is particularly safe. They're safer than startups, but not <i>that</i> much safer. You can lose your job at a large company at any time and with no warning.<br><br>Secondly, it is <i>precisely</i> when you're young (i.e. when you're right out of school) that you can afford to take on high levels of risk. You join a startup right after you graduate and it fails, so now you're 23 and broke. So what? <i>Most</i> 23 year-olds are broke anyway. Sure, I can agree, when you're older and have kids and a mortgage to support, the risk may be too high for you to take. But when you're young and have no responsibilities, what does it really matter if what you do fails? If nothing else, you can at least tell yourself that you tried. That's a heck of a lot better than spending the rest of your life wondering 'what if?'.<br>\"\"It's literally one in a million.\"\"<br><br>Uh, <i>literally one in a million</i>? Please. Use some common sense and some basic math: do you numbers really work out? Surely we can all think of the following 5 highly successful SV-headquartered tech firms <i>just on the Internet </i>: Google, Ebay, Yahoo, Facebook, YouTube (Ok, now part of Google, but it was a standalone startup recently). And that's just talking about some of the most successful <i>Internet</i> startups, that's not even talking about other successful startups in biotech, enterprise software, telecom equipment, medical devices, semiconductors, etc.<br><br>So, we have 5 highly successful Silicon Valley consumer Internet companies. Yet you said that the odds of a startup being successful are \"literally one in a million\". So that must mean there were 5 million Internet startups created in the Valley, right? Do you believe that? <i>There are only 2.5 million people in Silicon Valley</i>, and obviously the vast vast majority of them do not work in startups, or even in the tech industry in general.<br><br>I think a far more reasonable calculation would be as follows: probably at most 10% of the entire population in Silicon Valley works for startups. I think even that's generous, but let's go with it. So, 10%: that's 250,000 people. Obviously many of those startups are not Internet startups (i.e. they are in biotech, medical devices, semiconductors, etc.) So let's say that 1/3 of them were Internet. That leaves about 80,000 people. Let's say the average startup has perhaps 15 people. So we're talking about 5000 total startups. Hence, of those 5000, 5 of them became the superstars (Google, ebay, etc.). That's only one in a <i>thousand</i>, not one in a million. And even of those that didn't become superstars, plenty are still moderately successful.<br><br>Look, I don't disagree that startups are riskier, and so the question you have to ask is whether you can take the risk. I would argue that if you are young and free of commitments, you probably can take those risks.<br><br>Nevertheless, I think what is quite clear is that Stanford has the edge in terms of employment opportunities. After all, even if you don't intend to work for a startup, the threat that you <i>might</i> can serve as useful leverage when you negotiate with an established firm for better salaries or bennies.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jmilton90</b><br><br>Is this a discussion about Stanford undergrad versus Berkeley undergrad?<br><br>If so, it shouldn't be much of a discussion or debate..<br><br>", "<b>Username: middsmith</b><br><br>\"\"Uh, literally one in a million? Please. Use some common sense and some basic math: do you numbers really work out?\"\"<br>it's a figure of speech. and it could be true. Why do you bring up 5 companies that made it? obviously the ratio of the really successful startup to moderately successful that still hang around is very small. Do you hear from folded startups? There are thousands that pop up every day and thousands that fold. Anyway, OP should go to Stanford, join a startup, and pray for the next big break.

But if you feel confident enough to take that on, then Berkeley would be a better choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>\"\"it's a figure of speech. and it could be true.\"\"<br><br>Uh, if it was a figure of speech, then why did you use the adjective \"literally\"? Seems to me that you didn't believe it to be a figure of speech, but that you actually <i>literally</i> believed it to be true.<br>\"\"Why do you bring up 5 companies that made it?\"\"<br><br>Because it shows quite simply that if what you say is <i>literally true </i>- which were your words - then 5 highly successful Silicon Valley startups would have to be countered with 5 million failures. Do you believe there are literally 5 million failures? If not, then why did you use the word 'literally'?<br>\"\"Do you hear from folded startups?\"\"<br><br>Again, see above. Are there really 5 million folded startups in Silicon Valley? There aren't even 5 million total people in Silicon Valley. In fact, there are barely even half that many people.<br>\"\"Anyway, OP should go to Stanford, join a startup, and pray for the next big break. That is if OP thinks he's likely to get\"\"<br><br>I don't even think it's a matter of praying for the next big break. Frankly, there are numerous other reasons for joining a startup. First off, many startups actually pay <i>higher</i> salaries than do the established firms. {Note, that's just because there are just lots and lots of startups with a high variance in pay conditions, meaning some will pay better while others will pay worse, so you can simply choose to not work for the ones who pay worse.} That's right - you get a higher salary <i>and</i> you get a shot at becoming rich. Secondly, startups tend to offer far more interesting work. You have far more freedom to do what you want and shape your career than you do in a large firm.<br><br>The only issue is the matter of risk, and like I said, if you're supporting a family and a mortgage, then sure, startups may not be the way to go. But if you're young and have no commitments, that is precisely the time that you can take the risk. Your startup folds, so what? Just join another one. Like you said, new startups are founded all the time, so you can always find another one to join.<br><br>", "<b>Username: middsmith</b><br><br>Ok, whatever. OP will choose Stanford like 95% of them.

When it comes to a direct comparison between Berkeley and Stanford, there is really not much of a difference between the institutions' prestige in the US and in the world. In my opinion, what makes Stanford and Berkeley so outstanding from other schools, especially the Ivy Leagues, is that both universities are excellent in all academic disciplines: from Arts &amp; Humanities to Engineering.
