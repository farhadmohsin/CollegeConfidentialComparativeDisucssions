{"title": "state flagship vs cornell", "comments": ["<b>Username: hstarschools</b><br><br>Hi CC,<br>I reached out to the admissions people from Berkeley and Cornell and managed to delay my college decision response by a week and a half; I am deciding between offers from the two schools. I do not qualify for any financial aid and am from a middle to upper-middle income family. Berkeley in-state tuition will be about $14k per year and Cornell tuition will be $55k per year. Finances are not a big concern for my family but I want to make the best value-based decision between the two schools since the tuition difference between the schools is non-trivial.<br>I am interested in a career in finance, for which Cornell has an upper-hand over Berkeley, but I also have an interest in computer science and technology, for which it can be argued that Berkeley has an edge based on its location. I was initially drawn to Cornell for its strong presence in the financial services sector, but I am not yet entirely sure that I want to pursue a career in that industry so that is not a deciding factor for me. Location-wise I prefer Berkeley but that is also not an important consideration for me. The most important consideration is whether Cornell\u2019s marginally stronger undergraduate experience is worth the premium tuition over Berkeley in-state tuition.<br>When I did some research on Cornell I noticed that it has 15,000 undergraduates, about 8 to 10 thousand more undergraduates enrolled than at any other \u201ctop\u201d private school, which is about the same number of undergraduates as the undergrad population of the University of Virginia. I also learned that Cornell is not fully a private school; it is half a statutory or public school affiliated with the State University of New York. Based on this fact, and the fact that Cornell offers tuition remissions to New York State Residents at its contract colleges, I am wondering if members of CC would recommend that I as a California in-stater pick Cornell over Berkeley since Cornell looks to be a state flagship of sorts for the state of New York and is the federal land-grant institution of New York the same way that UC is of California. This question is about value return of the premium tuition; I met a Wisconsin resident who paid out-of-state tuition for UC\u2013Berkeley for a year and returned to Wisconsin to attend the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison since she did not believe that the out-of-state premium of UC\u2013Berkeley was worth it given the resources that she was offered. This question is specifically for me and other students of families in the middle to upper-middle income bracket who are full-pay; financial aid packages are likely much better at Cornell than at Berkeley. I would like to know the opinions of Cornellians and CC-ers in general if the extra ~$40k of tuition per year at Cornell undergrad vs. in-state tuition at Berkeley will offer significantly better private school instruction, alumni networking opportunities (during both the College years and down-the-line in one\u2019s career) and selectivity and rigor of the student body than what is offered at Berkeley.

No part is run by the state of NY. The state helping with tuition and those particular colleges within Cornell (none of which the OP has even indicated they are contemplating for their own admission anyway) having a mandate to accept more NY residents does not equate them to being public colleges. I can\u2019t say whether it qualifies them as publicish since I\u2019m not sure how that is being defined. I\u2019m not sure which part of what I wrote originally you thought was incorrect. If you have evidence that the state of NY hires and fires professors, pays professors, sets curriculum, or even has a hand beyond a minimum requirement of students needing to be from NY, please show me. Aside from subsidizing tuition for NY residents, does the state even have a hand in the budget process for these colleges in Cornell? All of those things would perhaps lead me to believe they are \u201cpublicish\u201d. Otherwise, all I see is that some of the colleges receive some extra financial support for tuition in comparison to other private colleges in NY. Other private NY colleges also get money from the state for student tuition (TAP, STEM scholarships), so are they also publicish? Or is it just that the state requires a certain number of students in those colleges to be from within NY that it makes them publics?<br>Anyway, none of the makes sense as a reason to decide for or against Cornell for this student.

The differences between Cornell and the other Ivies were reduced as the other Ivies started allowing academically accomplished kids from poor families to attend, early in the 20th century, and, after the 1950s, when the tech race with the USSR and the importance of high tech in the military raised the profile and prestige of engineering and of engineers.<br>So Cornell does have a vibe that is more similar to state flagships.

I just have a few more things to add:<br>The upper-middle class versus middle-class argument is difficult. If one is making over $200k in a year, it cannot be assumed that the person has been making that sort of money their entire life. One of my parents got a new job paying that figure relatively recently. Additionally, when you look at that income, about 35% is taken away from it by taxes, leaving one with $130,000, then with $70,000 taken away by college one is left with $60,000 which is not a large amount of money to use to pay housing bills, lifestyle expenses in the Bay Area and contribute to retirement accounts. It is not like my family doesn\u2019t have any savings though so I am fortunate to be in a situation where my parents are willing to let me consider full-pay Cornell vs. in-state Berkeley, especially since they know that I would like to attend a private University on the east coast, and Cornell just so happens to have the Ivy League luster.<br>At the same time, I am not sure what the exact financial situation of my parents is, as I am their kid and they are not completely transparent about the situation with me. I am not sure if $160,000 is \u201cchump change\u201d to them so maybe it is best if I exit this relatively privileged conversation on CC and have an honest conversation with my parents so that we can come to a family decision on the matter.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hstarschools</b><br><br>(continued) To address the conversation of Cornell\u2019s contract colleges being private and/or public, I did a lot of research on Cornell since I am really interested in the school and I found more information indicating that it was originally intended to be a public school. From what I read, Ezra Cornell and AD White arguably swindled the State of New York of its Morrill Act land-grant funds signed into law by Lincoln and created a smashed-together private/public school that is simultaneously privately endowed and receiving a non-trivial amount of funding from the State of New York. Unlike its Ivy League peers, Cornell was not founded in the pre-Revolution timeframe between the 1600s and late 1700s - it was founded in 1865, just 3 years before U.C. Berkeley, which is also a land-grant school. Someone pointed out that M.I.T. is a land-grant; that is interesting, I will have to look into that. So its membership in the Ivy League/\u201cAncient Eight\u201d is dubious. But although Cornell has over double the number undergrads of most of the Ivies and almost double the student-faculty ratio, it still has half the number of students and half the student-faculty ratio of Berkeley, resulting in smaller class sizes, so it can\u2019t be equated to Berkeley. Ultimately this decision is difficult because we live in a society that is striving to give a student, no matter what their financial background, an opportunity to excel at the highest level of merit without regard to finances. But that is a utopian view. As can be seen in this thread, financial considerations are important for those debating between schools of similar stature but with a high difference in cost. In a utopian world, I would be able to simply pick Cornell since, according to my preferences in going to a better funded and endowed school, it is the clear pick over Berkeley for me. But due to real financial considerations and the fact that Cornell and Berkeley are \u201cclose enough,\u201d I have to pick a worse (in my opinion) University, Berkeley, and go to school with double the number of undergrads and student/faculty ratio for four years - potentially putting a dent in my future vs. what I would have access to at Cornell.<br>For me, if the choice was Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Penn-Wharton, the answer would be clear as day. Pour the money into the more prestigious program, taking out loans if you have to, and let life and the networking take you from there. But those are not the schools that I am able to pick from. And because of that, there is a really high chance that I will wind up at a state flagship school instead of a private school that I marginally prefer.<br><br>", "<b>Username: cptofthehouse</b><br><br>Cornell holds an unusual place in our household.

After speaking to her friend who was there she got scared of the intensity ( whether it\u2019s real or perceived). She needed a different type of environment.<br>I would sit down with your parents and decide if the cost of Cornell would be difficult to sustain for 4 years.

Even die hard Cornell people here have agreed.<br>I\u2019m also telling you that even without that differential in place, there are those who have carefully looked at both choices that would prefer Berkeley or other state schools to Cornell.  There is an intensity, an edge, something about the atmosphere at Cornell that does not appeal to a number of people who have the direct choice of going there or to another school without the ivy luster, the NYC connections and higher rankings on standard lists.  I see it all of the time because Cornell is s staple on college lists here in my area. No question at all, that it\u2019s a great school and that those who complete there get a fine education and a boost in terms of finding sought after jobs.  I wish some of mine had given Cornell the thumbs up (as well my alma mater, but there are those preferences)<br>You have two excellent choices.

Flawed rankings try to push the notion onto the public that Cal is a marginal top 20 university. It is not. It is an unanimous top 10 university, on par with the likes of Columbia, Cornell and Penn. Cornell will be more heavily recruited by Wall Street IBanks, just as Cal will be more heavily recruited by Silicon Valley tech companies. But that does not justify the $160k delta.<br>Of course, if money is not a concern whatsoever, then going for fit may make Cornell the better option. But otherwise, Cal is the way to go here.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hstarschools</b><br><br>@Alexandre I disagree because a family that does not qualify for need-based financial aid should, in my opinion, invest the extra money for their kid to go to a school like Harvard or Stanford; the kid deserves to have their spot at one of those types of schools. My original question is about CC\u2019s general opinion on whether a family should spend the money to send their kid to a top but lower ranked private school vs. a somewhat similarly ranked state flagship (if they reside in a state such as California, Michigan or Virginia). Of course, this question is irrelevant to a family who considers the ~$160k difference to be \u201cchump change.\u201d<br>Another data point that I wanted to include is that tuition at Cornell\u2019s contract colleges is $20k less than full sticker price for New York State residents. That is a net savings of $80k, a pretty penny, over four years that a student gets simply for having family residing in the state of New York. This data point is important for my concern about value; why should I as a California resident, who benefits from large tuition remissions at my local UCs and CSUs, pay a premium to attend a school that gives tuition remissions to its local state students that I am unable to benefit from? To me this is a conversation similar to: why pay out-of-state tuition? Although I understand that Cornell is a private school, not a state school. If the debate was between a lower ranked UC and Cornell the choice would be Cornell, but a debate between Berkeley or UCLA and Cornell has a little more meat to it (for a CA state resident). My overall question is: should I not be thinking about this scenario this way? Is Cornell\u2019s NY State Resident tuition, cheaper than sticker price but still quite expensive compared to the in-state rates of state schools, significant in the discussion of the school\u2019s value? Thank you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hstarschools</b><br><br>@mom2twogirls You mentioned a couple of times that I seem to \u201cprefer Berkeley\u201d and I want to make the correction that I do not, I prefer Cornell.

They are peer schools regardless. Certainly close enough that a $160K price advantage is sufficient reason to choose one over the other.<br><br>", "<b>Username: oldfort</b><br><br>I have 2 girls who went to Cornell (most long time CC\u2019ers would know that) and I also have 2 nephews from CA who also went to Cornell, so I have long history with Cornell.<br>The reason my kids chose Cornell over other schools was for its size.  They did not want small LACs.  They wanted the feel of \u201clarge public school,\u201d but with funding/resource/flexibility of a private school.  Cornell and NU fit the bill, but they didn\u2019t want to go to a school in the midwest.<br>Cornell gets some funding from NY state, at the same time they are not beholden to NY government on how to run the school.  I think until you have worked in a government agency you really do not have any idea how much you have to adhere to government\u2019s policies and \u201cperceptions\u201d to general public.  As an example, most companies encourage their employees to work from home, but most of NY government employees (SUNY included) do not due to perceptions.  If there are critical conferences at vacation resorts (Vegas, Miami, Scottsdale, et) you are most likely not able to go because of perception.  How much one could get paid (not matter how specialized your skills are) is also capped.  Their procurement process (buying new technology/equipment) is long and tedious.  Cornell does not need to follow those rules because it is a private institution.  They have large endowment through private donations that they could provide great resource to their students.  They do not need to go through 20 layers of approval every time they want to try something new (very important for advanced technology).<br>Berkeley is a great school with very good reputation.  If I lived in CA I would have a difficult time in sending my kids to other peer private schools.  At the same time, I would consider its ongoing budget issues, diversity of its students (large percentage of Asians), resources available to its students, red tape at the school because it is public.<br>Even though Cornell is a large research uni, both of kids\u2019 majors (Math, Philosophy) were so small that each student was able to give a speech at their departmental graduation.  To be expected, majors like Economics had much larger number of students.  Few times when my kids had issues, from dorm room, grading, to study abroad, were quickly resolved.  My emails to the school were always answered promptly.  Now they are few years out of Cornell, they are still very connected to the school because many Cornellians have common experiences (slope day, Halloween parties, even prelims).  Cornellians are roommates after graduation, they look out for each other at work, and refer jobs to their friends (D2 has landed 2 jobs through her friends at Cornell).  Both of my nephews were able to get summer internships by contacting some alumini.  My kids were in large introductory courses first year, but most of their advance classes in their majors were small.  They knew their professors well.  D2\u2019s professors wrote very personal recommendations for her law school applications.  One of them still get together with D2 whenever he is in town.<br>I do not know Berkeley\u2019s alumini network.
