{"title": "northwestern vs rice", "comments": ["<b>Username: college1114</b><br><br>Hi, I\u2019m trying to decide between NU and Rice. Chicago I think is better than Houston, but Rice weather is better than NU. I like that everyone at Rice is in a residential college system and that it\u2019s smaller, but I like that NU has better school spirit and seems like a better environment. I\u2019m most likely going on a premed track, and from my research they seem pretty even in academics. Any thoughts on which school would be better?<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>I think Northwestern is a little bit stronger academically overall \u2013 very strong in STEM, social sciences and the humanities. Rice is known for its strength in STEM but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s quite as strong as Northwestern elsewhere. That said, I\u2019m sure Rice is adequate in the non-STEM areas. Assuming you plan on majoring in a STEM field, small differences in quality elsewhere might affect your electives but your major studies will be top-notch.<br>Is there a notable difference in cost? It sounds like you like them about equally.<br><br>", "<b>Username: college1114</b><br><br>There\u2019s not much of a cost difference, which just makes this decision harder haha. I do want to have the whole college experience of parties, athletic games, good friends, and a nice environment in addition to strong academics. I\u2019m not sure which would be better for the overall college experience. I feel like I\u2019d have more opportunities at NU being near Chicago, but the Texas Medical Center is also right across from Rice. It really is pretty even between the two for me, and I\u2019m hoping to get some comments to help sway me a little. Also, I know rankings mean nothing, but based on Niche, Rice seems to have an edge on NU for student life, professors, etc. but NU seems<br><br>", "<b>Username: college1114</b><br><br>NU seems more well known (sorry my post got cut off)<br><br>", "<b>Username: juillet</b><br><br>I don\u2019t think being near Chicago will give you more opportunities than being in Houston. Houston is a major city; it\u2019s the fourth largest city in the United States (right after Chicago, actually!) and health, medicine, and biomedical research are  big drivers of Houston\u2019s economy. I\u2019d say your opportunities are roughly equal, at least in any sense that would matter to an undergrad. Rice does a lot of research and is located right next to the Texas Medical Center - but there are lots of other industries in case you change your mind.<br>I\u2019ve only been briefly in both cities but it\u2019s been my experience that moving around Chicago without a car is far easier than getting around Houston without one.<br>If you want something closer to the stereotypical \u201ctraditional\u201d college experience - parties, big sports games, school spirit in spades - Northwestern is probably more likely to provide that, at least superficially. But in actuality, the \u201ccollege experience\u201d varies a lot from school to school and even from person to person. There are definitely people at Big 10 schools who haven\u2019t attended a single sports game and don\u2019t care a whit about sports. And college students everywhere like to party and make good friends, so you can find that at Rice, if you want!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>If cost is equal, then this is a personal decision. Go with your heart as both are very prestigious schools with brilliant, accomplished and, most importantly, hardworking, ambitious students. Congratulations !<br><br>", "<b>Username: SatchelSF</b><br><br>Houston &gt; Chicago, and this will only grow over the next 30 years.  Rice is also in the nicest part of Houston proper.<br>As for prestige, I think it depends on who (and where) you ask.  There is no question that while both schools\u2019 reputations have increased dramatically over the last 30 years, I\u2019d say that Rice\u2019s has improved more on a relative basis, especially in the South and West of the country.<br>Congrats - you really can\u2019t go wrong with either, but I think I\u2019d lean Rice for most fields of interest.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>Interesting post by Satchel. I couldn\u2019t disagree more. I have never, and would never, rank Houston above Chicago for anything beyond oil production and uncomfortable humidity.<br>But, even so, it is a personal decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Houston1021</b><br><br>Can you visit both schools for admitted student events before you decide? Both have gorgeous campuses. NW is on the lake while Rice is in the museum district of Houston. Rice will have nicer (not brutally cold) weather in the winter/spring, but NW will have nicer (not brutally hot and humid) weather in the summer/fall. NW has Greek life while Rice does not. Rice has the residential college system. Both have division 1 sports. NW has good spectator sports atmosphere while the Rice students mostly ignore the sports teams. Both are terrific schools.There are plenty of parties at both schools.  You can\u2019t go wrong with either choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: StanfordGSB00</b><br><br>@college1114 - both are great schools. But, the unfortunate truth is that Rice\u2019s great reputation in Texas doesn\u2019t travel to the to the coasts well. In NYC (arguably, the world\u2019s capital), you will often get a blank stare when you tell someone you went to Rice. And yes, this is even among a lot of educated people. As one of my good friends went there, I have great respect for the school and its students / alumni but the reality is that it is considered more of a regional school in the NE and on the West Coast. The reasons for the less than expected footprint is its lack of well known grad programs (Law, Medical, Business, etc) and its smaller class size that was historically 50%+ Texan. This means there are very few Rice alumni on the coasts. Rice is unquestionably a great school but Northwestern is on another level in terms of reputation, name recognition and general prestige. You have a ton of Northwestern alumni in New York, LA, SF, Chicago, etc. If you can endure a Chicago winter, then I think Northwestern should be the clear winner here. Also, Northwestern has significantly more geographical diversity - it has more students from California, New York, NJ, Texas and Florida in one class year than is the total size of Rice. And that combined with its Big 10 sports, very large endowment, top grad programs (Kellogg, Feinberg, Law School) and successful alumni across industries (Colbert, CEO of IBM, etc.) make it more of a well known name. Northwestern is the \u2018safer\u2019 decision here given its more established reputation across disciplines.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Boothie007</b><br><br>Northwestern<br><br>", "<b>Username: robotrainbow</b><br><br>I beg to differ that northwestern is better known on the east coast then Rice. Northwestern is a mid west school. I went to Penn. I applied to Washington university. Knew of u of Chicago and Notre Dom but even when my kids applied didn\u2019t really know anything about northwestern. Being from New Jersey I knew North Eastern, always got them confused. Rice I was always vaguely aware of because of its connection to NASA and to Kennedy and to science in general. I know that\u2019s just me but I am not that unique. I just went through two rounds of college for my kids neither had northwestern anywhere on their radar and I don\u2019t think anyone from their high school applied and HS sent multiple kids to the ivies every year. A good friend of my daughter got a full ride at NorthEastern and other kids applied there.Anyway I think Northwestern is even more known mainly in its region then Rice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>I assure you that Northwestern University is very well known & very well respected on both coasts by major employers.<br>Confusing Northwestern with Northeastern speaks for itself.<br><br>", "<b>Username: StanfordGSB00</b><br><br>I can assure you that the opinion of @robotrainbow is not reflective of reality. If you look at her post history, her child enrolled at Rice \u2013 so some obvious bias there. And confusing NE with NU is analogous to confusing Penn State with Penn, which doesn\u2019t happen among educated people. Look at the top NYC private prep schools / New England private prep schools / CA private prep schools like Harvard Westlake where these students largely can choose wherever they want to go and Northwestern will be in the top 10-15 most represented schools. Rice will not be found. Also, look at the top 10-15 feeder schools to the top MBA programs, and you\u2019ll see Northwestern there. Look at Columbia, HBS, Wharton, Stanford, etc. Rice - no where to be found. Also, look at the incoming Investment Banking analyst classes in NY at the top banks - Northwestern will have a few analysts. Rice may have some students at the Houston offices but usually not in NY. Rice is a great school. But, it\u2019s reputation just isn\u2019t that strong on the coats. And considering that Northwestern is more selective / has higher test scores than Rice and AND has more students from NY and NJ in its freshman class than Rice\u2019s entire freshman class (including Texas), I would beg to differ that Rice has a stronger reputation. Not even close.<br>Look at Dalton (one of very top private prep schools in NYC) -<br>https://www.dalton.org/page/programs/high-school/college-counseling<br>Look at Harvard MBA top MBA feeder colleges -<br>https://poetsandquants.com/2011/08/15/top-feeder-colleges-to-harvard-business-school/<br><br>", "<b>Username: WildestDream</b><br><br>Won\u2019t make a difference for medical school admissions. I think Rice and NU are very similar for undergrad\u2026with the exception NU follows a quarter system. NU is also part of the Big 10 if this interests you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Kevin308</b><br><br>I find it interesting that the arguments for Northwestern are based around NBA and banking when the kid wants to do premed.   The are both very prestigious  school A two of the beat in the country anyone who says otherwise isn\u2019t being honest with you.

Rice features in the list of top medical school feeders, NU does not!<br>For what it is worth \u2026 the data is compiled from linked pages and probably isn\u2019t complete.

Anyway, I concur that for pre-med they\u2019re about the same, but for other programs NW is better. This would matter if the OP switched majors or wanted to add a minor an unrelated field, say economics or international relations.  In that case, NW probably has more well-regarded programs.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Idaho_Father</b><br><br>@college1114 : 2 great schools; what a fantastic position to be in!  These are 2 of my HS jr daughter\u2019s favorites. Have you gotten feedback on the relative ease of doing research as an undergrad at both? NU is more than twice as big enrollment wise, so assume you\u2019d have more competition for research work\u2013but would be good to check and confirm.<br>Average class size at Rice is notably smaller than NU, so seems like that\u2019s something to weigh.  Some other things to check on would be the number of students declaring pre-med at each school, who your advisor(s) would be and their background/experience.  Re\u2019 the latter, if you were able to talk to each school\u2019s advisor and ask some open-ended questions, that could be really helpful\u2013beyond their relative success as a \u201cfeeder\u201d into med school.<br>Congratulations on gaining admission to both of these schools; what a compliment to your hard work and preparation!<br><br>", "<b>Username: coolguy40</b><br><br>Do you have a way to pay for them?

I just maintain that Rice is not a more regional and less nationally known school then northwestern.<br>Northwestern is a larger school so it would be quite plausible that it has a larger alumni network. Both are great schools. Hopefully the original poster will find one to be a better fit. Climate, size, location hopefully will help.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sunny66</b><br><br>I think Northwestern is more well-known since it (1) has been an elite university for a longer period of time, and (2) has bigger-time sports. Having said that, grad schools and well-educated people likely would hold both schools in similar regard. And I think the prestige gap between the two is small and is closing. I personally would prefer Rice due to smaller size and lack of Greek life. As a lesser factor, I also would prefer the whether at Rice during most of the school year (though not the summer). For pre-med, I have heard Rice is outstanding.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ferpmerp</b><br><br>Rice has a much lower global ranking than northwestern which means in a broader frame of comparison the undergrad/grad at rice is probably not as prestigious. You will have an advantage applying to Texas med schools from rice tho.<br>Both schools have really high med school success rate, but that\u2019s skewed by the fact that a large amount of people who enter as premed do not stick with premed, meaning that the population represented by these proportions is already the hardest working portion of the students there, making such statistics less predictive of your own success than they may seem.<br>The point is, I think that you should value flexibility over the minor differences in prestige or outcome stats. Being a premed now doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be a premed in a year or two and backup majors are essential. The quarter system at northwestern offers you more opportunities to explore your interests and take more classes, allowing you to double major or or get a minor in one of the many areas of study offered at NU.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CU123</b><br><br>Toss up.

NU\u2019s tuition is slightly higher but its better known. NU\u2019s undergrad population is 8,500, while Rice has less than 3,800 undergrads so it depends if you prefer close knit community or a bigger one. Rice is warm and NU is cold so depends upon your personal preference. Do you want to wear shorts in December or jacket in April? NU has great sports scene. Rice has residential colleges. NU has graduate schools, Rice is across the street from tons of places to do internships. Did you get merit or aid at either college?

Dartmouth College is much bigger than Rice, yet puts out only a tiny fraction of the research that Rice does. Princeton University has fewer National Merit Scholars than Rice (even in absolute numbers), yet is overrun with nearly 2000 more students overall. Because Rice is so small but the faculty conducts such large amounts of research and development, undergraduate research is available to a greater percentage of students at Rice than at any other major university.

If it\u2019s true that Rice has more grade inflation, it may be better to be a premed there.<br>@robotrainbow<br>I understand that NU is not known to you and it\u2019s easy to generalize based on your own experience. However, people with experience with law schools (T-14 law schools), business schools (consistently top-5), economics programs (consistently top-10 with 4.9 out of 5.0 in PA score), performing arts or journalism would likely know Northwestern. That\u2019s covering a lot of people already even at the undergrad level since econ is usually the most popular major. You mentioned science with Rice; NU actually outranks Rice in most science disciplines and has one of the best chemistry departments in the world. Like it or not, reputation is closely related to graduate programs; when two schools are of the same type (mid-sized private research in this case), the one with better graduate programs by a good margin is going to have more national reputation. There are exceptions such as being an Ivy or an elite Catholic but neither applies to Rice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Faulkner1897</b><br><br>I don\u2019t know much about Northwestern (other than its high level reputation), as I have never visited and neither of my kids applied.
