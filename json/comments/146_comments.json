Thanks!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Creekland</b><br><br>If money is an issue, I\u2019d stick with Penn St.  They are considered a very good engineering school.<br>If money is not an issue, one thing you can look at is what programs/projects each university has going on and see if undergrads are participating in any that are preferred by the student.  If so, hands on in labs can translate nicely into internships - several companies work directly with some schools.  The \u201cbest\u201d engineering school in rankings is not always the \u201cbest\u201d school for any particular goal.  A school that is working with that goal has an edge.<br>Note that projects can be competitive so a place having something is not a guarantee that any particular student will be able to work on it, but the odds are better there than at a school that doesn\u2019t offer it.  Having more than one project going on that\u2019s of interest to the student increases the odds that they could get into something they like.<br>Another way one can look at options is if they have a preferred place they think they want to work.  If so, look at who\u2019s already working there and where they graduated from.  Give that school extra bonus points in your \u201cpro\u201d column.  Sometimes students also email people within companies asking them if they have a school preference or not.  Often there isn\u2019t (among schools like you listed and with mechanical engineering), but sometimes there can be.  This can coincide with the projects mentioned above.<br>Best wishes with your decision!<br><br>", "<b>Username: skarekat</b><br><br>Thanks Creekland!  Let me put it this way, money is not a major issue, but I do not want to throw in an additional 12k every year if for example, Penn State and Purdue offer very similar level of education/training/programs/projects/internship/job opportunities/etc.  I\u2019m willing to pay the extra $$ if those things are significantly better than Penn State.  My son seems inclined to go to UIUC (Out of State for him) but is the additional 17k per year justified for his major (Mechanical Engineering).  I know the mid-west probably has more of internship/job opportunities in Mechanical Engineering, so would that be something that should be considered or would a Penn State student have an equal shot at those internships or jobs?  Thanks!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsenior1</b><br><br>Totally biased here as I have a Boiler, but she loves Purdue.   It\u2019s been an amazing freshman year.  I also think your estimate is high. We were at $44k oos and that was with honors college fees.  Tuition is frozen again for next year.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sevmom</b><br><br>Penn State instate sounds like a good opportunity. Can\u2019t see any reason to spend thousands extra  every year anywhere  at an OOS  engineering school for a comparable outcome (unless you are very wealthy  and willing to pay for whatever price any college choice might be),  Since you seem concerned about price, listen to your gut. Hopefully, you communicated your financial  limits to your son before the applications went out.  The only reason I might see for going OOS  would be if he did not get into PSU main campus  for engineering(doesn\u2019t seem to be the case?) or if it seemed to be an unworkable fit.  Many kids in engineering go to their state schools or look for merit that brings the cost down. Penn State has  very good recruiting and outcomes, I believe.<br><br>", "<b>Username: skarekat</b><br><br>Thanks @momofsenior1 and @sevmom.  We liked Purdue a lot when we visited the campus last summer (July 2018).  Though my son visited Penn State I personally haven\u2019t visited Penn State.  He seemed to like UIUC and Purdue better.  I\u2019m planning to visit Penn State soon with him since the last time he was there they got rained out.  He has an admit to Penn State main campus and is waitlisted at Schreyer (Penn State Honors).  What are the chances of getting accepted into Schreyer from a waitlist?<br><br>", "<b>Username: sevmom</b><br><br>Not sure Schreyer  needs to be a deal breaker if PSU is otherwise a good fit. Many kids in engineering  don\u2019t care all that much about honors as most of their classes are challenging as it is (and they are with mostly good students and hard classes already}.  Are there any living/learning communities at PSU for engineers?   I love VT and one of my kids is an engineering grad from there, but we were instate.  How much did you agree to pay for with your son before the process began?   We told our sons , for instance, that we would pay up to instate costs .<br><br>", "<b>Username: eyemgh</b><br><br>The benefit of honors is VERY school dependent. Of the schools my son applied to, there was only one where honors made an appreciable difference for engineers. The things to look for are no increase in size to the curriculum, actual honors engineering classes that are smaller and taught by the best instructors, and early registration. I agree with everyone else. These schools are all very similar. You wouldn\u2019t be buying a better career or earnings, just a different experience, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that if it\u2019s important and you can afford it. Otherwise, they\u2019d be far better off if you just give them the money upon graduation to invest, start their own kids\u2019 college fund, or make a down payment on a house.<br><br>", "<b>Username: VA-NC</b><br><br>You cannot go wrong with VT Honors.

None of these schools want your kid to fail.  Don\u2019t over think this stuff.  If your son is motivated and  going to do well in engineering, he will do well regardless of school. All of these schools are great for engineering.  Finances and fit should guide you. Good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: RichInPitt</b><br><br>All are very good schools and generally comparable.  My daughter had to chose between Penn State, Purdue, VT, and a few others and is very happy at Purdue.  I think a student just needs to spend time on campus and feel for the best fit - it\u2019s different for different people. She loved Purdue and VT and hated Penn State, even though many of her HS friends were going to PSU.<br>Fwiw, I think I\u2019ve paid under $43K, all in, at Purdue the last 2 years, and they\u2019ve frozen tuition through 2020-2021.<br><br>", "<b>Username: skarekat</b><br><br>The competition is intense these days.

Hence he\u2019s considering one of Penn State, Purdue, UIUC or Virginia Tech from which he already has admission offers.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MWolf</b><br><br>The best schools on the list are UIUC and Purdue  (they are about equivalent, so it would depend on field), then VT, and then PSU. That being said, the difference between UIUC and PSU is not really worth the extra $68,000, IMO.<br>So, if cost weren\u2019t an issue, I would say UIUC or Purdue, unless one of the other two schools appeals to your son for some reason or another. If cost is an issue, PSU provides the best value of the lot.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sevmom</b><br><br>Well, my husband went to Carnegie Mellon decades ago in engineering and played basketball for them. He has mentioned more than once that he probably would have enjoyed Penn State more!  Please don\u2019t let  your  son go off to any of the state schools feeling he is settling if he does not get into CMU or Cornell.   We loved UVA and VT  instate for our sons in engineering. Older kid in particular was  competitive for lots of the  usual suspect engineering schools.  It really is many times  about fit and finances at the end.  Engineering  and  computer science are much more trendy these days .   My kids come from a long line of engineers .   Not me, of course!  Good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: skarekat</b><br><br>For some reason, maybe based on information he gets from his friends, he doesn\u2019t think too highly of Penn State. We haven\u2019t visited VT yet. We did visit UIUC on 7/3/2018 when hardly anyone was on campus so we couldn\u2019t get a good feel of the campus activity. The information session was very perfunctory so we had to pretty much walk around campus ourselves without a guide. Purdue on the other hand was bustling with activity on 7/2/2018 and the student guides were extremely friendly and took a lot of effort in showing us around. So I personally liked Purdue a lot. My son liked UIUC better.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br>UIUC normally does direct admission to major, but some admits get an alternate major or undeclared.

If there are some that are attractive to you, definitely consider that highly when making a final decision. All of your choices are good for the basics. It\u2019s fit that can make a difference. Part of fit is college life, part is finances, and with mechanical engineering part can be specific lab experience on a resume, though remember there\u2019s no guarantee any student will get on a specific project.

Good/bad/indifferent, you fit or don\u2019t. I felt that way when I was touring (far too long ago\u2026) and my S19 does too. For example, he loved EVERYTHING about Northwestern and we felt it would be a good fit for him. Beautiful campus, football spirit, location, etc. When he went to visit, as much as he loved everything, he said  \u201cI don\u2019t fit with these kids, they are all so different than I am.\u201d My husband looked around (who also was admitted/didn\u2019t attend NW) and totally agreed. It was a shame, because other than that, it is perfect. We lean toward a traditional college town/campus. Some people prefer cities, some people don\u2019t mind an array of buildings and designs to them. We, prefer uniform buildings, places like VT and Notre Dame build new buildings to replicate the old ones. That is a draw for some (us) and means nothing to anyone else\u2026if sports interest your S, some of his choices have more spirit than others.

At Purdue he will need to keep his freshman GzpAhigh to get into mechanical engineering.  Its very doable as long as he has been exposed to calculus and honors physics or bettercin high school.  Purdue offers all freshman an engineering seminar designed to expose them to a variety of engineering disciplines and help students make a good choice for major.   Purdue has sons of the best co op degree plans and industry connections. Purdue has similar school spirit to the other public programs. Purdue\u2019s campus is walkable and has attractive matching brick buildings. UIUC seems more spread out and less attractive in some ways.   UIUC seems to have Chicago high school clicks and a very large number of international students from China. Could be a positive for some students.

CMU and Cornell are harder to get in, maybe substantially harder to get in than Purdue or UIUC, even for OOS.  The CMU stats are 1480-1560/34 for engineering while Purdue engineering is 1350-1470/32.
