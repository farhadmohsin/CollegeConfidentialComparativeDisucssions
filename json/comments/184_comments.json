{"title": "university of alabama vs fordham university national merit finalist", "comments": ["<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>Hey everyone! So I\u2019m trying to decide where I should go to college and, like everyone else, I\u2019ve got until May 1st to choose. My two choices I\u2019ve narrowed it down to are Fordham (full tuition) and Alabama (full ride+), but I can\u2019t decide where I want to go. Because of my AP credits and likelihood of redshirting to play baseball, I\u2019m also taking into account getting an MBA or JD from one of these schools. Anyways, here is my list of pros and cons for each school. Maybe you all could help me decide which one I should choose!<br>Pros of Fordham:<br><br>In NYC<br>Internship opportunities<br>School in London to study abroad<br>Will be able to play baseball there<br>Smaller class sizes<br>Considered a better school overall academically<br>I actually like the idea of the core classes<br>Campus is beautiful<br>5 year BA/MBA program or 6 year BA/JD program (plus they take AP\u2019s)<br>Bar scene and NYC run social life<br>Cool Manresa/Honors programs I can take part in<br><br>Cons of Fordham:<br><br>Sports are not a focus<br>No Greek life<br>Limited parties (especially big ones)<br>Core curriculum does take a while<br>$15k a year for room/board<br>NYC is expensive<br>Law school and MBA is expensive, so it\u2019d be nice to not have to spend $60k in undergrad<br>Cold winters (minor drawback, I like the cold but it makes playing sports harder)<br><br>Pros of Alabama:<br><br>Treated like a king because of NMF<br>Completely full ride plus a $3500 stipend each year<br>Greek life<br>Focus on sports (tradition, especially football)<br>Baseball would be big time (SEC)<br>College town (cool atomosphere)<br>No pressure to rush because of scholarships<br>Could spend five years and still be covered by the scholarship (even for grad school)<br>Honors college (although I know at some schools people think it\u2019s just extra classes\u2026 I don\u2019t think so but I\u2019m not sure)<br><br>Cons of Alabama:<br><br>Considered a slightly lesser school academically<br>Larger class sizes<br>Worried that there are many people who could potentially distract me, pull me down<br>Could get boring not being in a huge city (although Birmingham is close)<br>Not a huge fan of stereotypical southern culture, but I recognize that Alabama is probably more diverse than I\u2019m giving them credit for<br>I\u2019m worried about job prospects<br>Fewer internships compared to Fordham<br>Might be harder to get a job somewhere else, whereas in NYC it might be easier to network<br>Will be harder to play baseball, and there will be an even larger time commitment (I still think it will be worth it)<br>Not sure if academic culture is the same as it is at Fordham<br>Worried about the value of an MBA from here (law school is supposed to be pretty good)<br><br>So there you have it! That\u2019s my semi-definitive list of my pros and cons for each school, and I\u2019d love to hear what you all think. They\u2019re two completely different schools, and each one satisfies part of what I want from a college experience. Still, the key things that it really comes down to are: Academics, Social Life, Cost, and Value of the Degree. Based on that general criteria and my list, which school do you think I should choose? Any help is appreciated. Thanks!<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>So really, if we boil these down to main fit categories:<br><br>Academic fit: Fordham<br>Social fit: Alabama <br>Sports fit: Tie?<br>Cost: Alabama <br>Environmental fit: Tie?<br>Jobs/internships: Fordham <br><br>Which environment do you prefer: weather, campus, city surroundings?<br>And if you had to choose, would you rather be a baseball player at Fordham or a baseball (and football/basketball\u2026) fan at Alabama?<br>And can your family afford to pay for Fordham without taking on much debt?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Tinymom</b><br><br>I think the biggest thing to consider is your parents\u2019 financial position. Do they have $60K set aside for your college or would that be a struggle for them? Do they have other children to educate or is it just you?<br>And how do you see yourself in 10 years? You are obviously very bright. Do you want to be a big-city lawyer? If so, Fordham gives you a foothold in NYC. Or do you want a more laidback life with lots of fun? Alabama probably only gives you entrance into \u2026 Alabama, but that might be just fine with you. Very different schools! Good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@prezbucky I think you\u2019re right on the money with that breakdown. That helps me see the big picture more clearly. And to answer your second question: I\u2019m not quite sure. On the one hand, I recognize that part of the Alabama experience (especially things like tailgating, frat parties, etc.) is something I might not ever be able to do again in my life. That part appeals to me because I don\u2019t ever want to feel like I missed out on something when I\u2019m older. The same could be said for playing baseball though, because I know many people in their 40\u2019s just wishing they could play one more game. I think if I choose Alabama I\u2019m really going to have to commit to baseball; that way I\u2019ll have no regrets.<br>@Tinymom this goes with what @prezbucky had mentioned as well. We do have the ability to pay $60k, but if I go to grad school then it changes everything (and as of now I\u2019m likely to go). The amazing thing about Alabama is that I could graduate in 5 years with an MBA and have spent no money. That is unreal to think about! Whereas at Fordham, 5 years would cost around $100k (because the 5th year would be the cost of graduate school).<br>Especially if I\u2019m hoping to go to law school, I\u2019d rather be able to save my parents some money and possibly do some cool things with it instead (travel, study abroad, etc.). So to answer your question, yes we have the money to pay for Fordham thanks to their generous scholarship, but I do not want my parents (or myself) to face the financial burden of grad school after spending a decent amount on undergrad.<br>Also, I just talked to my dad about this decision, and one thing we decided was that I don\u2019t have to sacrifice the big-city life just because I don\u2019t go to school in one for undergrad. If I do well enough at Alabama and crush my LSAT, then I could very well go to a top law school on the east coast (maybe even end up at Fordham haha) and still find myself working in a big city. On the other hand, I can\u2019t do the opposite. I can\u2019t go to Fordham and then try to party with a fraternity and play big time baseball at 22 in Alabama!<br>So wow, I\u2019m definitely leaning toward Alabama now; this is pretty unprecedented for me, because for the longest time I was super concerned with college rankings and status. Now I\u2019ve realized that fit is even more important for a decision that is really contingent on your happiness rather than what some website says is better. And with my path I want to be on in life, my undergrad ranking could end up being the least important thing I\u2019ve ever worried about!<br>Still, do I have a right to be concerned with University of Alabama academics? Will I be challenged? Will I be bored? That\u2019s my one big fear\u2026 other than that I\u2019m pretty much sold, even though I\u2019ll have to think on it for a lot longer. Thank you both!<br><br>", "<b>Username: zannah</b><br><br>If you live in or near NYC, you need to try somewhere else and decide what kind of place you want to live. At Alabama, you have a free ride to a very good education. School reputation is interesting and Jesuits are terrific, but the differences in education are not as different as you and others might think. You can fly to London probably through Atlanta because of the volume of national and international flights. Alabama is within driving distance to Florida, coastal Georgia, Nashville and Smokey Mountains\u2026There is lots to see and do in the South and some clear cultural, political and religious differences too. There are opportunities for internships in the South. An education in the South is not second class unless you don\u2019t apply yourself academically or spend too much time socializing. Football in the South is competitive and fun.<br>Finally, I can\u2019t imagine asking my parents to spend $60000 tuition. What are you willing to let parents and siblings give up because of your tuition? Finally, a free ride is a luxury that allows you to travel, study, invest in your education, and sort out your adult life. There is serenity and satisfaction earning an education without worrying about money. Try the South. It is an opprtunity, not a prison sentence.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@zannah you\u2019re exactly right. I didn\u2019t mean to come off that way; I\u2019ve actually lived in Kentucky for a few years in the past and I really enjoyed it. I think it\u2019s something I will enjoy again in college.<br>I was just worried about how it would mainly impact the education/career part of my experience, but from what you\u2019ve said it doesn\u2019t seem like a huge deal. As for the money part, the more I think about it, the more I realize how much money $60,000 really is\u2026 especially when compared side by side to $00000!!!<br>I think I\u2019m going to end up at Alabama\u2026<br>I\u2019m not 100% sure yet but I\u2019m getting close to deciding; thank you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Chardo</b><br><br>If grad school is in your plans, save the money and enjoy the Alabama experience.

The honors college and hundreds of NMF are very encouraging.<br><br>", "<b>Username: STF4717</b><br><br>Don\u2019t undersell the academics at Alabama.

Smart kids, engaged kids!<br>I lived in NYC for a long time, and then moved to Alabama.  It was a rough transition, but I wasn\u2019t on a college campus.  There are TONS of out-of-state students at Alabama these days.<br>The $60K is the winning argument, however.  That is a lot of money to be saving\u2026and sets you up nicely for grad school.<br>My vote is for ROLL TIDE!<br><br>", "<b>Username: mommdc</b><br><br>I think as far as the academics go, the 75th percentile at Fordham is about a 680-690 for math and English.<br>So 75% of students will be lower than that.<br>While the 75% percentile is a bit lower for the whole UA student body, the honors and the NMF students that you will be taking classes with will have higher stats than that.<br>You now need a 1480 plus SAT for the Presidential scholarship I think.<br>In NY housing on or off campus will be very pricey.<br>Take the money at UA and take advantage of all the opportunities it awards you.<br>The money your parents save can be used for law school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@STF4717 wow!

Luckily I\u2019ve lived in almost every part of the US up to this point so I know what I\u2019m getting myself into, but I think you\u2019re right that being in college will help make the transition even easier! I also think you\u2019re right about the smart kids\u2026 especially with the honors college experience.<br>@mommdc I was actually surprised to see the top 25% of Alabama students have a 31 or higher on the ACT. I\u2019m sure a lot of those students are in the honors college too so I think you\u2019re right in saying that group will be overall \u201csmarter\u201d than the general student at Fordham (at least based on test scores).<br>I agree with both of you that the $60k would be better used toward graduate school. That\u2019s more than a year of law school paid for right there!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Eeyore123</b><br><br>How many AP credits will you have? If you are thinking law school, If you can finish your undergraduate degree in three years, you could be 2/3 of the way through law school under scholarship.

So maybe I do law school at Alabama and then get my MBA somewhere else\u2026 I\u2019m not entirely sure just yet!<br>Ultimately I think I want to end up on the east coast so that\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking grad school will be my end game.

Because I\u2019m not entirely sure of my future prospects, you\u2019re right to say that I shouldn\u2019t be making those type of decisions now. I\u2019m really just trying to make sure I take full advantage of the five year scholarship\u2026 maybe I could get a masters in something else\u2026 possibly economics! Or political science! So many options.<br>@itsgettingreal17 @Cookies510 you are both correct that big law may not be right for me. While I like the hustle, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s something that I want to do long term. When I\u2019m no longer young and full of energy I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d appreciate it as much\u2026 then again, I can\u2019t be sure as I only have Internet forums and other people\u2019s experiences to go off of. I guess I\u2019ll be able to find out for myself in a few years <br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@Chardo that makes sense, and I\u2019ve heard similar things from nearly everyone else: higher ranked law school = more opportunities. I\u2019m sure I will apply to some T14 schools after finishing undergrad to see if I can get in and to see if the money is worth it. Just have to crush my LSAT! Best case scenario would be to get a 3.8 with a 170 (which may sound unreasonable but I\u2019m asking you to trust me: with months of prep and my drive, I think it is doable).<br>That way I could get into some of those T14 schools and maybe even get a scholarship from some of the lower-end ones, although that might be a long shot. I guess I just ultimately want to have as many options as possible, and doing well on the LSAT makes that a reality for me. That\u2019s where I have to start!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Chardo</b><br><br>@grant1509 I would expect nothing less than 3.8 from someone with your credentials.  With plus-minus grades at UA, an A+ being worth 4.33, the top students like you that gets lots of those have an easy time being at or near 4.0.  Every year there are hundreds of President\u2019s List 4.0 grads.<br>The 170 LSAT is not as easy, but not unreasonable.  My brother actually had no intention of law school.  He was getting his MBA, and working at a test prep place to make some money.  He was teaching an LSAT review course.  Decided that if he\u2019s teaching the course, he should take the test for the experience.  He got 175.  Then he said I guess I have to go to law school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@Chardo that\u2019s awesome that it worked out that way for your brother! Maybe I can luck into something like that.<br>And thank you for the vote of confidence. I know that if I work hard I can maintain a really high GPA, although I had no idea about the weighting of UA\u2019s grades. An A+ being a 4.33 is really nice. Now I just have to go out there and perform! Hopefully in three years I\u2019ve got some really good law school choices (if that\u2019s the route I pursue). I\u2019ve also been looking into a Masters in Economics and a Masters in Political Science from UA\u2026 both are only one year and it might be nice to have before law school, especially if I realize I\u2019m not going to UA! It would guarantee that I take full advantage of the scholarship while not limiting my law options. Win-win!<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>Hey everyone! Yesterday I went to an awards ceremony and was offered a $40,000 scholarship (10k for 4 years) from an organization in my state!! The gratitude I\u2019m feeling at the moment is beyond words\u2026 it\u2019s a true life-changing opportunity. As far as I\u2019m aware, the scholarship can be used for any educational expenses as long as it\u2019s billed by the school. What I\u2019m wondering is how that works with the full ride from UA?<br>I\u2019d use part of the $10k for a meal plan, and then other parts for technology/supplies/fees (if I can), but what about the money that\u2019s left over? Would the University of Alabama just give it to me, kind of like an extra stipend? That would be incredible if they would, but if not then I don\u2019t want to just throw away the money. Maybe I could ask the foundation to put it toward my graduate school if I need it? What do you think?<br><br>", "<b>Username: DiotimaDM</b><br><br>@mom2collegekids ^^^  OP has significant outside scholarship. How does stacking work at Bama?<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Goodness gracious. Grant, I like your idea of and mba and law degree to help you have a wide array of options in the business world. M and A work or law. Inside gc or just a traditional commercial banker or executive with a law degree is very impressive. All kinds of industries would value that combo. Who knows if you want to be an associate at Skaden. Nothing wrong with that but maybe won\u2019t be your path.<br>Don\u2019t plan your whole life right now. Go to a school where you will do the best academically. The extracurriculars are icing on the cake not the main ingredients.<br>I would personally go to Fordham and play ball. But that\u2019s me.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@privatebanker it\u2019s funny to me because I\u2019ve only just turned 17 (I skipped a grade) and I feel the need to plan my entire life in the matter of a couple weeks. It\u2019s ridiculous, I know, but how can I not when the biggest decision of my life to this point is coming at a time where I can\u2019t even vote yet? I\u2019m not crazy, right? The whole concept of having teenagers make a life-altering choice based on what they read on internet forums and hear from Uncle Joe is completely ludicrous in my opinion.<br>It\u2019s for that reason that I overanalyze it; I perpetually hedge my bets with the hopes that this one decision does not end up being the one that ruins the rest of my life, or throws away my years of hard work, or at the very least limits me in what I want to do. I just want to be sure I\u2019m making the right choice, and simulating possible outcomes hundreds of times in my head, self-determining the probability that my college choice ends up going the way I want it to, and then posting rambling comments on this forum is my way of managing it all. Maybe not the best idea, but it can\u2019t be the worst either.<br>As for a JD plus MBA, thank for your confirming the notion that it is a smart career choice. The key for me is doing it with as little debt as possible, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m leaning toward Alabama. This new scholarship ($40k) could change things, but I\u2019m still not sure. Thank you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Good luck. Neither school choice will lock in your fate one way or the other.

Anything towards room and board is taxed as income.   I believe it kicks in after 2500.  And, it used to be taxed at PARENTS tax rate.  Not sure with new 2018 tax code.   Definitely something to look into.<br>Congratulations!<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@4Gulls great article! I\u2019ve seen so many people mention how often Alabama gets mentioned on CC (some who are less than pleased), yet to me it seems deserved. When you are a public, flagship university and are giving away almost $150 million in merit aid, I think that deserves some recognition!<br>As for Fordham, it truly is amazing. I\u2019d be able to study at their satellite campus in London if I wanted, I\u2019d play baseball for sure, and the honors college is actually one of the big reasons why I want to go, although I haven\u2019t been accepted into it yet which is unfortunate. I think only ~30 kids get in and I guess I wasn\u2019t selected <br>I was not able to visit on admitted student days because of baseball and family conflicts, but I\u2019ve been to Fordham\u2019s campus recently. While I haven\u2019t been able to visit the University of Alabama, I\u2019m pretty well aware of what I\u2019m getting into. I\u2019ve talked to 5+ recent alum, called their offices ~10 times with various questions, and contacted a few underclass students there already. As a whole, they were pretty unbiased (except for admissions of course) seeing as they all had different experiences. Because of this, I think I have a good idea of what I\u2019d be getting into.<br>I love the culture at both schools, but what really separates the two for me is the school spirit and pride. Fordham has it, but it\u2019s different because many students are essentially living in NYC and going to school at Fordham. I\u2019m not just talking about commuting; it\u2019s even their motto: \u201cFordham is my school, New York City is my campus\u201d. So while that is awesome, it loses some points for traditional college feel (sports, tailgating, parties, dorm culture, etc). Alabama on the other hand is a true college town and has all of that in spades.<br>I think what\u2019s really appealing for me is the fact that the Fordham experience doesn\u2019t have to be limited to this moment in my life, whereas Alabama does in a sense. After graduating from Alabama undergraduate, I will be 20 years old, so I can still go to Fordham or some other NYC or Boston school and enjoy that city lifestyle and ultimately end up there if I want. If I go to Fordham, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a very high chance I\u2019d end up in the south, and I think it\u2019s at least worth it to experience it sometime in my life.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@Longhaul that would be incredible! So I would pay ~$4k for a meal plan and then maybe $1k for any other miscellaneous charges, meaning I would be able to pocket about $5000. Then after it\u2019s all taxed I\u2019m sure that might be cut in half (assuming a ~25% tax rate of the $10k), but pair that with the $3500 stipend I\u2019d already be receiving and I would have around $6000 to spend\u2026 as a college student! Wow\u2026<br>At Fordham, my current cost of attendance in total would be $15k-$20k/year (including various expenses associated with being a college student and living in NYC). The $10k scholarship helps immensely and makes it $5k-$10k/year, but that\u2019s still $20,000-$40,000 over the course of four years that my parents would be funding, compared to the $20,000+ I would be earning over five years at Alabama.<br>So Fordham is still something to consider due to the quality of the education and the location, but I think that Alabama sets me up for life in an almost impermeable way. Wow, this is tough!<br><br>", "<b>Username: twoinanddone</b><br><br>Do you think you could make the baseball team at Alabama?  I don\u2019t know how good you are, but there are just going to be some teams that are out of reach.  My daughter could have gone to a D1 school and made the team but not ANY D1 school.  She could play at Fordham but not at Florida (Alabama doesn\u2019t have her sport) or Maryland.  UMass?  Maybe.<br>I ask this because Alabama may be a different experience with sports than you are planning.  I\u2019d pick Fordham if you can afford it.<br>Also, is there a chance for you to get a baseball scholarship after the first year?  A friend went to Fordham on a small swimming scholarship and by her senior year it was full tuition.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@twoinanddone you raise some great questions, and I\u2019ve thought about them long and hard for the past two weeks. Like I\u2019ve mentioned before, I skipped a grade, so I\u2019m not physically mature yet. I\u2019m sitting upper 80\u2019s with my fastball and three solid offspeed pitches, which puts me in solid D1 territory pitching-wise. Most Alabama recruits are around 90-91 freshman year (and almost all are bigger than me), but all of them are a year or two older than me as well. Personally, I know I have more left in the tank, I know I\u2019m going to grow more and get stronger, and I know that I will work my butt off to get what I want.<br>I\u2019ve talked to a couple ex-college coaches (one was a mid-major D1 head coach for 20 years, the other coaches a JuCo that has won a national championship) and I asked them to give me their honest opinion, no holding back. Both said that I could go to Fordham and play\u2026 possibly play a lot, even as a freshman. They said that there would be no guarantees at Alabama, that I\u2019d have to work harder than everyone else, and that I would have to redshirt freshman year without a doubt.<br>Both said that because of my academic scholarship, I\u2019m a free player, and that gives the coach incentive to work with me at least for the first year and see how things go. Still, because I\u2019m not an athletic scholarship guy, that also allows the coach to cut ties that much easier.<br>After my redshirt year, and especially after my sophomore fall, I\u2019d have a pretty clear indication of whether or not it\u2019s going to work out. For me, that\u2019s a risk I\u2019m willing to take to play baseball at the highest level because it\u2019s something I truly love. But both coaches also recognized that baseball isn\u2019t my end goal in life, and both mentioned that I may give it all I\u2019ve got for two years, it might not work out, and then maybe I\u2019m okay with that because I know I gave it my all. Or maybe I do that and then end up transferring if I realize that baseball is that important to me.<br>Also, Alabama is in the SEC so that makes it a top-50 type school, but it\u2019s also in the bottom half of the SEC. I\u2019m not taking anything away from the school\u2019s baseball program; I\u2019m simply saying that it\u2019s different than schools like Vandy or Mississippi St, at least for baseball. Alabama will have plenty of guys drafted, but it\u2019s not like those schools where nearly every guy is a draft-worthy prospect. I think that fact, coupled with the NCAA regulations that limit scholarships to 27 out of 35 players on a D1 baseball team, give me the long shot that I need to make the team.<br><br>", "<b>Username: DiotimaDM</b><br><br>Please call Bama to ask about stacking. It would be unusual for a school to let you stack scholarships in excess of full COA. Maybe Bama does, but it\u2019s worth a call to be certain, especially if you\u2019ll be basing an important decision on the answer.<br>If they won\u2019t stack it you can talk to the scholarship provider. Maybe they will let you save it for study abroad or grad school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: grant1509</b><br><br>@DiotimaDM good call on having me check with them. They said that the outside scholarship will go into my school account, and then any money not used in my account will be refunded to me! That\u2019s huge! Even though it\u2019s taxed, I will have well over $20,000 given to me over four years, along with my fifth year still being free in regards to tuition. I\u2019m not sure how I can turn this down?<br>I\u2019m thinking three years of undergrad at UA for sure, then I could get a Masters in public administration or criminal justice over the next two years (I know they\u2019re completely different). After that, I can go to a different law school if I want, or I can just go to Alabama law school if that\u2019s what I decide is best! I\u2019ve seen many articles about kids with above a 165 LSAT getting full rides to some good law schools. I think that\u2019s more than doable for me. So many options, and no debt!
