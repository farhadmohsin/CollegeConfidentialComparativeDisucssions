If you want to go to Duke, you should go and not think for a moment that its CS department is not strong enough.  Aside from having specific programs in Silicon Valley, recent articles make clear that Duke does very well on a per capita basis and is well regarded in SV.  Brown also is highly regarded and places well.  So, as with many threads, commentators are drawing absurdly fine distinctions between outstanding departments when, in the long run, there are no meaningful distinctions and fit is the best reason to choose.  Duke in particular, if it matters, is growing key AI and machine learning research areas in conjunction with Stanford and MIT and combining that with its best in the world statistics department.

It is a very well rounded university with excellent graduate school/professional placement and a loyal alumni network. I don\u2019t see what Brown gives you. Berkeley is clearly better for CS.

Although Duke is located in the South, most of the kids come from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, California and Florida.  Duke does not feel like a Southern school and even though it\u2019s not located in a major city, there is constantly a lot going on with incredible speakers from all over the world and all sorts of research opportunities.  After taking the college tour, my D\u2019s comment was \u201cmom, there is so much going on there, it feels like they are throwing opportunities at you.\u201d  FWIW, Melinda Gates went to Duke and has donated a lot of money there.  Duke is constantly is reaching out to its Alumni to create internships and all sorts of learning opportunities for its students.  Brown does as well: as a parent of a committed student I was already sent  information requests about whether there was anything I could contribute career-wise, and I know an alum who mentors kids in her industry.   Both Brown and Duke are well represented in Silicon Valley.<br>I think of the social life at Brown and Berkeley being similar.  Both are very collaborative places and the kids are very liberal and accepting.   Duke has more social striation and Greek life can be important.  Berkeley ultimately came off our list because we were concerned about the huge class sizes and ability to get the classes you want.  I also felt that the advising programs at Brown and Duke were better.  If we were in-state for Berkeley, my D would have gone there, but I just couldn\u2019t see paying the out of state price when I think you get less services than you do at the privates.<br>But these were our impressions.

Duke is not as stressful as your other choices.  Duke wants you happy. Your employment opportunities are better at the other schools because employers want people who have been through the wringer.

EECS, the toughest major to gain admission  is direct admit out of HS so the students there are not cut -throat, and you\u2019ll be taking classes with students in EECS.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Burrito12</b><br><br>Any other thoughts would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Burrito12</b><br><br>Bump, sorry just panicking haha.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ciervo</b><br><br>What did you decide?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Burrito12</b><br><br>I decided to go for Brown!
