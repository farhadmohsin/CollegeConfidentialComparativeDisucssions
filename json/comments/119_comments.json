But these three seem so similar and I would greatly appreciate CC\u2019s insight.<br>(NOTE: Hamilton has admitted me as a Jan. Start and I\u2019m intrigued by the program in London. I\u2019m currently working on a contingency plan in case London is cancelled.)<br>I\u2019d like to study public policy/international relations and psychology/neuroscience, which is partly why I love the open curriculums at Grinnell and Hamilton. I also enjoy how the trimester schedule at Carleton will ensure that I can deeply study material with only 3 classes at a time. Furthermore, I want to grow my relationship with the outdoors, journalism, and civic engagement wherever I attend.<br>As a potential political major, it\u2019s important to me that I can talk and live with classmates of different backgrounds and ideals. But I\u2019m concerned that a place like Grinnell/Carleton may be too homogenous, in terms of political ideology, to name one example. Similarly, I know that Hamilton struggles with diversity of race, as another example.<br>Socially, I wonder if I\u2019d benefit from a more balanced culture like Hamilton\u2019s (e.g. light side vs dark side) or a slanted one like Carleton or Grinnell\u2019s, if these distinctions are accurate. I also wonder how these schools differ in terms of nightlife/social scene.<br>These schools seem to have superb programs for my majors, strong endowments to survive the coronavirus, and a strong quality of life, right? Are there any more distinctions that you can make between these schools, perhaps reputation-wise, student-body-wise, or student services-wise?<br>Where, ultimately, would you suggest that I attend out of these three?<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>Based on the depth of your interests, you would make a great addition to any of these academically top-notch schools.<br>With respect to your choice, Hamilton offers some programs that would align especially well for you. Hamilton is one of the very few liberal arts colleges that offer a major in public policy; similarly uncommonly, it offers a long-established term-length program in Washington, D.C.; and its especially flexible curriculum combined with the range of its available programs suits the diversity of your academic interests.

I also have some familiarity with Grinnell.  I know less about Hamilton.<br>First, all three are excellent schools.  Is cost an issue?  I\u2019d give that a lot of weight in these times.<br>You are correct in that Carleton and Grinnell are very similar in terms of vibe and general campus culture.  Both are VERY liberal, with Grinnell being a little more so.  Less than 1 percent of students at these schools voted for Trump.  If you supported Biden or Clinton in the '20 and '16 primaries, respectively, you\u2019d be considered right of center at these schools.  Even back in the 1980s, I remember a poll of one of the Carleton senior classes and more people supported socialism than capitalism.  I have seen both schools on various \u201cmost liberal colleges in America\u201d-type lists.  Both are frequently on Princeton Review\u2019s list of Most Liberal Students, whereas I can\u2019t remember seeing Hamilton on that list (at least not recently).  Both Carleton and Grinnell have also been mentioned in \u201cbest colleges for hippies\u201d-type lists, whereas I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen Hamilton on those.<br>All three schools are majority white.  I believe Grinnell is the most ethnically diverse of the three and Hamilton the least, but it\u2019s not a super huge difference, at least according to figures I can find.  Grinnell also has the most international students.  I believe Grinnell is probably also the most socioeconomically diverse, but I could be wrong on that.  Carleton and Grinnell have a large number of LGBT students (on the order of 25% to 35%).  I don\u2019t know what the numbers are at Hamilton.  Hamilton is probably the most ideologically diverse and overall the most moderate, but all three colleges lean left.  By the way, note that the countryside surrounding all three of these schools is actually a lot more conservative.  If you make an effort to get \u201coutside the bubble\u201d of all these schools, you\u2019ll discover quite a different cultural, political, religious and economic environment.  All three colleges have roughly equal percentages of male-identifying and female-identifying students.  Carleton probably has the most regional (geographic) diversity (when excluding foreign students).<br>My experience with psychology at Carleton was \u2026 not so good.  However, that was mostly due to one professor who is no longer there.<br>I\u2019ve heard positive things from a few people who did the neuroscience concentration/minor, including one of my former roommates who went on to get a PhD in the subject.  There\u2019s also a brand new science building on campus.<br>The political science department was home to two great luminaries: Paul Wellstone and Steven Schier, who represented different, complimentary, aspects of the field.  Schier represented the intellectual side of the discipline, emphasizing rigor, research, data, analysis.  Wellstone emphasized activism, involvement and civic engagement and the experiential, human side of the field.  Schier has retired and Wellstone was killed in an airplane crash.  I\u2019m not sure how the deparment has faired without these two giants, but hopefully their spirits are still felt.

You have some good info above but I do not agree that Carleton and Grinnell are super liberal. We visited both campuses twice. We found kids really mainstream. Nothing like a place like Oberlin where we thought it was teeming with social justice warriors. I would not call Grinnell or Carleton any more liberal than most college campuses. S19 spent a good amount of time with young alums from both schools (alums in their early 20s) and they were not hippies in the least.

For example, when my recruited athlete had meal with team, unlike most schools where that really was just with teammates, at Grinnell, it was the team plus a whole bunch of other students, who ranged from blue hair to Polo shirts. And everyone seemed to enjoy each other. Both my kids really enjoyed the culture at Grinnell, and the classes they sat in on. Town had its charms \u2013 no better or worse than, for ex., Oberlin, Ohio, in that it has the basics a college student needs \u2013 excellent grocery with lots of interesting beers, organic foods, prepared foods etc., plus pizza shops, doughnut shop, bike shop, independent movie theater etc. My kids liked that there was a single dining hall at Grinnell, so that everyone passed through there at some point, and the food was really good. I can\u2019t compare it to the other choices, but Grinnell is a wonderful community, with deep resources, a commitment to socio-economic, racial and ethnic diversity, and unusually good sciences for a LAC. Plus, both kids liked the flexible curriculum which meant \u2013 for my non-STEMy kids \u2013 no one would force them to take more math/science if they didn\u2019t want to. (Of course, they both wound up at schools with more distribution requirements and had to take math AND science).

Grinnell is even more of a bubble with very little going on in the town. But that bubble is pretty awesome. Grinnell has a ton of money and is very supportive of whatever a student wants to do on campus. We felt, too, like fewer kids went into the work force from Grinnell. It\u2019s seemed great for kids who wanted to go to grad school or med school but their career services seemed more lacking than Carleton\u2019s where more companies seemed to visit, etc. S19 isn\u2019t planning grad school and Bowdoin has a strong record of job placement after graduation so that was also a pull for him.<br><br>", "<b>Username: homerdog</b><br><br>If you don\u2019t want to start in January, I think Carleton fits you better.

But you\u2019re also taking fewer classes per term (3-4) than the average semester student takes per semester (4-6) so it evens out in the end. Both students are going to end up taking 36-40 or so courses over four years.<br>They also say you don\u2019t have to declare your major until the end of sophomore year, but that\u2019s true at most liberal arts college (and most colleges, period). They use chemistry as an example, but that\u2019s probably the worst they could\u2019ve use. The Carleton chemistry department says themselves that chemistry is a highly structured major, and recommend you have finished certain classes (including organic chemistry) by sophomore year.<br>There are 9 of those classes - 10 if you don\u2019t place into chemistry 123 - and they build; the basic required chemistry sequence takes four trimesters, and those classes gate everything else in the major. If you wait until the beginning of your junior year to take them, you can\u2019t take anything else in the chemistry major until the winter (second) trimester of your senior year, and have only two more trimesters to finish your chemistry major.<br>In practice, it looks like this works out\u2026pretty much like any other liberal arts college. Students can technically take until sophomore year to declare, but in practice it\u2019s better if they identify a general area of interest early on take the prerequisite classes in their first two years while they are deciding what exactly they want to major in.

If you were really looking forward to being with the rest of your class in the fall and worried about the social ramifications of the late start (not everyone is, btw), I would count that as a big negative.<br>But I think next fall may be odd \u2013 late start, online start \u2013 who knows?  So that could work in your favor.  You may not be missing anything except a tuition bill.

Yes, I\u2019d be excited to study abroad and wouldn\u2019t be too worried about social life since it\u2019d be with Jans. I don\u2019t have faith in the program running, though \u2013 and finding another way to get the credits is tough if I don\u2019t go. But they may roll out an online option, and that will fulfill credits and let me integrate with Jans, I believe. If I don\u2019t study through Arcadia, then the backup plans may be less desirable due to the social detriment (or maybe not, due to COVID)\u2026I\u2019m trying to figure out the transfer credit options and dk what that would look like yet.<br>The tuition factor is something to note but not the deciding factor, fortunately.<br>Big question is whether or not being a Jan is a net gain\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: Bill_Marsh</b><br><br><br><br><br> ucbalumnus:<br>\"\"<br><br><br><br> merc81:<br>\"\"<br><br><br><br> Bill_Marsh:<br>\"\"<br>Having Colgate in the next town with the option of taking courses there would seem to expand the opportunities for college life experiences at Hamilton.<br>\"\"<br><br>This might be an under-utilzed option, but I think it\u2019s a good suggestion for a student who sees a course or two in Colgate\u2019s catalog that offer particular appeal.
