I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple to say there are less grads from Rice (or any other school) at Yale than from the Ivies, therefore Rice is not a good choice.  There are likely some other factors at work too.  Rice is smaller than many of the other top schools, with less than 4,000 undergrads.  Rice also has a high percent of STEM major undergrads.   In 2019 about 1450 of their undergrads were engineering majors.  That doesn\u2019t mean the non-STEM get a bad education or the programs are not well respected.

We also suggested she not focus TOO much on her specific major.  While that was important, we thought she should consider where she\u2019d get a good education should she decide to change majors.

Research opportunities will be - well - different. All three are Research 1 universities - with the highest level of research activity among universities in the U.S. - but Rice is small university with just over 3,000 graduate students, whereas Columbia and Penn have much larger graduate student populations and research arms that span a very wide area.

The undergraduate culture is very stressy and competitive - but many of the students who are there tend to thrive on that, and they form tight bonds and are pretty supportive of one another. It\u2019s a pretty diverse undergraduate body, both in terms of identity and personality/interests. There are a ton of niche EC activities to do on campus and around the city, but if you\u2019re looking for school spirit and sports games, this is not the place for you, heh.
