{"title": "harvard vs georgia tech full ride", "comments": ["<b>Username: GaBassin</b><br><br>Hello everyone!<br>After much deliberation, I have narrowed down my college options to two schools. These schools are Harvard University and Georgia Tech. It has always been a goal/dream of mine to attend Harvard, and I still have a letter I wrote in the 4th grade noting these intentions. However, after being offered the Stamp\u2019s President\u2019s Scholarship (Full Ride) at Georgia Tech, my decision has become much more difficult.<br>Financially, my parents\u2019 income hovered around 180k in 2016, which caused Harvard to give me 32k in aid. Thus, I would still need to pay around 40k a year with around 5k being student contribution (Federal work study etc.) and 35k being parent contribution. However, my parents are only willing to contribute 15k a year to my education, which would leave me with 20k in loans per year, for a total of approximately 80k over four years. My Dad has said that he is willing to cosign on these loans if he must. Also, my Mom received a 20k raise in 2017, so my family\u2019s income is now over 200k. I know this increase will likely decrease my aid in my future years.<br>Contrastingly, Georgia Tech is offering me a full ride (Covering the entire COA) plus an $1,100 stipend for a laptop, $12,000 enrichment funding (Travel, research, etc.), annual retreats, a two week expedition before freshman year to an international location, priority housing, and annual trips to various domestic and international locations. My Dad is heavily leaning towards this option while my Mom has left my decision entirely for me. Also, if I attend Georgia Tech, my parents have said they will give me $100 a week and I will not have to work, whereas I would at Harvard.<br>In terms of career goals, I am planning to major in neurosicence with pre-med, where Harvard is ranked #1 in the world while Georgia Tech just began offering this major in Fall 2017. I am about 80% sure that I will continue to medical school, but if not, I will probably head to law school. Thus, I am about 95% sure I will be attending some form of graduate school unless my interests significantly change. My parents have said that if I attend Georgia Tech, they will place the 60k they are willing contribute to my education in an account for me to use for graduate school.<br>I am also concerned about the grade deflation of Georgia Tech versus the grade inflation of Harvard. Will the easier grading at Harvard significantly bolster my acceptance into a good graduate school?<br>Overall, I am aware that Georgia Tech is much more viable financially than Harvard. However, is Harvard worth 80k in debt? Will Harvard open doors and offer opportunities that I will regret missing for the rest of my life? Is 80k a measly investment for a Harvard degree? I would hate to look back in 10 years wondering \u201cWhat if I went to Harvard?\u201d but I would also hate to look back in 10 years wishing I had accepted a full ride because I now have crushing student loan debt.<br>So I guess this is the real question, is Harvard Worth 160k more than a full ride to Georgia Tech? (With 80k being student loans, 60k being parent contribution, and 20k being student contribution)<br><br>", "<b>Username: notstuy</b><br><br>I would take Harvard if prestige matters to you\u2026 if not, you will get a fine education at GT, its a great school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WISdad23</b><br><br>I\u2019m no expert and you seem to see the picture well. One thing to consider, even for good students, is that pre-med is time consuming. Having to work while in school is a huge disadvantage. If you go to medical school then at some point in the future you will have a similar choice: do I work where I fit or where the prestige is highest?<br>At Harvard you will be a dime a dozen. At Georgia Tech they are rolling out the red carpet and pre-selecting you as a standout for whom they are providing a standout experience.<br>In the future, do you take a job somewhere with low taxes, low cost of living, lots of autonomy but away from big city amenities; or do you live in a crappy condo, pay half your money in taxes, spend 10% of your life in traffic, but work at a prestigious facility? In the end, it is your call!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Much2learn</b><br><br>Yes, it is. Take Harvard. It will improve your odds for a top professional school, no matter how your interests evolve.<br>Harvard and Stanford have the strongest combination of undergrad, plus grad schools in law, business, medicine, engineering, and education.<br>Universities in the second most influential group are Columbia, Penn, and Yale. (And Chicago, if you ignore the lack of an engineering program).<br>The third group is Duke, Northwestern, Cornell, Michigan, and Berkeley (but has no medical school).<br>There are also a few influential but less broad schools: MIT, Cal Tech, and JHU.<br>These few schools control an outsized percentage of the top undergrad and grad school programs. Unsurprisingly, they tend to admit more of their own students to their grad programs (how could they explain to the Trustees that their own undergrads received a relatively poor education?) They also admit more students from the other schools in the group (because no one benefits from an admissions war.)<br>In the end, you can get into a top program from any school, but your odds are a bit better if you begin from inside the group.<br><br>", "<b>Username: justpaying</b><br><br>I know the heart wants what the hearts wants, but I can\u2019t imagine take on that much debt with so much more debt on the horizon.

You don\u2019t have any other schools offering merit aid that you are considering? Assuming not, Harvard doesn\u2019t seem affordable.

Best case at Harvard is at least 80K of debt when you finish, if not more.  Then pay for med school on top of that?<br>GT is a great school and will leave you very well prepared to move on to med school without the huge burden of student loans.  Before you choose Harvard, run some financial calculators so you can see for yourself what the real cost is of those loans.  You\u2019ll wind up paying over $150K for that 80K loan if you take 20 years to pay it off.  That\u2019s hundreds of dollars a month that will NOT go to a mortgage, or to investments, or in your own future kid\u2019s college fund.

Harvard is the easy and obvious choice here because admission to and payment for medical school is like undergraduate but on steroids.  Admissions rates hover around 3-5% for even a mid level medical school.  Costs are above 80,000 a year right now, and are going to be even higher in four years.  So, when people say take the money at Georgia Tech they are assuming that your chance of admission and cost will be the same.  I disagree.  With 3% admission rates, Harvard is clearly the better choice for admission to medical school, even, as I readily agreed, GT is a great school and a fine choice standing alone.  But, from the financial point of view, what you want for medical school is either admission to a low cost or free medical school (Baylor or Case Western) or merit money from the medical school.  If you don\u2019t get that, medical school is going to cost you nearly 400,000.  The medical schools compete for the very best applicants with merit money.  So, financially, that is the goal, to have such a stellar record that you can go to medical school at a far lower cost, and I would pay 80,000 all day for the chance to a) cut my medical school bill down and b) improve my chances for admission.<br>And, I am not, really not, picking on GT.  I think it is a great school.  But for kicks, just go to the websites of the top medical schools and see where the students came from.  Harvard, Yale and the like are overrepresented.  (Just to be clear, I did not go to Harvard I am just looking at the facts).  How many GT undergraduates are at Harvard medical school.  How many Harvard undergraduates?<br>And one more note for admission.  This forum is littered with threads that discuss people who failed to recognize just how tough it is to get into one of the elite schools.  Well, virtually every single medical school is sub-10% admission and requires the whole package of grades, EC, recommendations and more just to be considered. By way of example, George Washington Medical school has a three percent admission rate, lower than Harvard undergraduate.   You can\u2019t just get A\u2019s and get in, any more than you get get into Harvard that way.  All these people just assuming you can go or go to Harvard for med school, as if you could just walk up and get in.  No way.  So, if my dream was to be a doctor, and Harvard could facilitate that, it would be worth 80,000, particularly if was a way to cut down the huge cost of medical school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>I agree nearly 100 percent. With the exception that only looking at Harvard medical school as the analysis of who gets in doesn\u2019t represent even 3 percent of the medical school population.  If Harvard medical school is the end game then it is, of course, relevant. But that is not the practical application of your post. It is not reslistic for a Harvard undergrad to plan on Harvard medical school. In terms of sheer numbers I believe a school like university of Florida has the second most medical school admits in 2017. A big part is the size of the population. It may be for a pragmatic kid with h stats is to go to uf for free. Kill it and nail mcat. Then be assured of  med school and perhaps h, but the best chance of zero debt for both. And great matches come from a lot of schools post med school<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>And I think he should go to Harvard too  My point was just a discussion point.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hapworth</b><br><br>I agree with @privatebanker on his first point but disagree on the second.  @manyloyalties posits a powerful argument, but it\u2019s built on a lot of assumptions.  A lot of assumptions.<br>GA Tech knows that you\u2019re an elite admit.  This is why they are offering a full ride, plus a stipend (they are paying you to attend!), plus money for research and internet travel, plus several other perks.  What is Harvard\u2019s pitch? Nothing, aside from admission.  Harvard will not sweeten the deal (there is no deal; you\u2019ve been admitted; that\u2019s it).  Harvard will not work to compete with other offers.  Harvard doesn\u2019t have to.  It\u2019s Harvard.<br>But what does that mean?  Listen, I am not anti-Ivy.  I admire the students who have worked so hard to gain admission to the Ivies, Stanford, Duke and so on.  But I also admire those who take a pass, knowing that there\u2019s a better offer on the table.  You\u2019ll also be known on the GA Tech campus, and for the rest of your life actually, as the guy who got into Harvard but told them to take a hike.  There\u2019s something admirable about that.<br>You\u2019re in a position that is common.  You got into your dream school, but your family cannot afford it.  I don\u2019t know if this is because your family\u2019s EFC at Harvard is too high or because your parents are not willing to pay it.  Either way, Harvard is unaffordable.  GA Tech is not.  Full rides should not be treated lightly, and I know that you are not doing so.  In fact, I got a strong sense that you know that GA Tech is the smart move.  It\u2019s the brand name and prestige of Harvard that is beckoning.<br>Google the story of the young man who was admitted to all eight Ivies, plus Stanford, Duke, and so on.  He turned them all down to accept an offer just like yours to attend the U. of Alabama.  Why?  The same situation as you.  He wants to become a doctor and felt, with the cost of medical school ahead, he would be best served (and save his family money) to take the full ride.<br>I wish you best with whatever choice you make.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@Hapworth   I\u2019ll take 50%.

It seems to me it doesn\u2019t matter that UF sends a lot of kids to medical school for this analysis.  UF is much bigger and sends a smaller percentage.  And a smaller percentage to to top schools.  And I can see a path to going state school if you state medical school is cheap, and that is where you want to go, and the flagship sends a lot of kids.  So, UT austin on a full ride might lead you right to a cheap, but top, texas medical school.  Then your total debt might be minimal.  But that is not the case here unless the plan is to go to a georgia State medical school.  And, even then, I venture, going to harvard would likely result in merit money.  My point overall is that it is way to simplistic, if medical school is in the cards, not to even consider how it will play out with the next, larger, expenditure of 400,000 and the 3% admission rates.  I believe that you are far more likely to get in, and get merit money, coming from Harvard.  In that case, the debt is worth it.  I would say, at a mininum, nobody should simply assume that you can get the same output (cheap medical school), from a different input (GT v.Harvard but should at least look at the cost and stats from each school for medical school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>I just think this is not the correct analysis and I am not assuming anything, I am relying on facts.  Its not the cost of the undergraduate, but the total cost of undergraduate plus medical school.  Its also the ability to fulfill the dreams of a medical career.  It is not accurate to say that GT will necessarily produce the same result, although it could.  You are assuming that going to GT will lead to the same medical school and same cost as Harvard.  I am not assuming anything.  The facts show that Harvard students obtain admission to elite medical schools at a much higher rate.  Go onto the websites of the top medical schools and see how many came from Harvard and how many from GT.  Now, I don\u2019t think it is a mistake to go to GT.  It is a great school and free.  If you do extraordinarily well, you will get into medical school and maybe get merit money.  Life doesn\u2019t give you pat answers.  But, I guess I just don\u2019t get the simplistic analysis that Harvard or other elite schools are just \u201cprestige\u201d or \u201cnames.\u201d  They offer a lot beyond the name and here it is a fact that those resources lead to admission to top medical schools at much higher rate than GT and likely a much higher cost.  If you give that up fine, but don\u2019t argue that all you are giving up is a name.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Nomorelurker</b><br><br>I just noticed that OP also has UGA Foundation Fellows as an option. That might be worth considering as well, given that there would likely be less grade deflation as compared with GA Tech. The ostensibly higher GPA at UGA (compared with GA Tech) might help with future admission to med school. Also, graduating as a Fellow (top student at UGA) would likely lead to some scholarships from some medical schools as well, assuming OP does not change majors along the way. In any case, there is an argument to be made for many of the great options on the table, although taking on debt is very personal and should be discussed carefully with her/his family.<br><br>", "<b>Username: manyloyalties</b><br><br>https://mdadmissions.wustl.edu/how-to-apply/who-chooses-wu/.  Here is a link to the Wash U medical page, one of the top schools over ten years.  GT sent seven students, Harvard sent 56.  GT did very well, reflecting that it is a fine institution, one student a year, similar to other schools.  Wash U offers merit money.  The question is if undergraduate plus medical school is $480,000 or $400,000, an astounding number but true, and Wash U offers merit money and a \u201cfree\u201d md PHD program, are you better off spending the 80,000 to be one of the 56 or saving the 80 to be one of the seven.  Of course it is a little more complicated than that, as students make their own way, and so a student admitted to Harvard and GT will likely excel at GT and be more likely to be one of the seven.  But\u2026I don\u2019t believe that the resources and reputation hurt your chances.  I am passionate about this subject because just like students don\u2019t think carefully about the finances of college, they also don\u2019t think about what has become the astounding burden of medical school cost and the sooner you think about ways to manage it the better.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Chardo</b><br><br>Keep in mind that GT sends less students overall to med school, because most of their students have no desire.
