There is no wrong answer. If your goal is to go to a top medical school, then Harvard should be out. I personally know of 10 plus students who went to HYP and did the premed track. They all ended up at fine med schools but only 2 went to a top 20 med school. The other 8 had great scores and gpas but you have to remember that top med schools combine the randomness / holistic nature of top college / MBA admissions plus the stringent grade / test requirements that top law schools require. In other words, top med schools are a total gamble for anyone. Most of the acceptance rates at T 20 medical schools are less than 5 percent. I personally would choose northwestern over brown at the undergrad level regardless of the med school option, although both are great. The schools are pretty equal at the undergrad level. Sure, Brown has the ivy tag but Northwestern has been ranked higher than Brown in every us news ranking for the last 20 years and is trending up - should stay firmly in the Top 10. Brown is usually closer to 14. At the med school level, NU &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brown. No contest. A top research university (NU) with one of the best research / teaching hospitals in the world compared to an elite undergrad focused school that happens to have a mediocre med school. If your goal is to have the path of least resistance, then Brown will be the easiest option. But, you get nothing for nothing. For medicine, your residency is as important if not more important than your med school. If you slack your way thru Brown with a 3.0 GPA to just meet the mark there, your residency options will be severely limited as they absolutely look at undergrad transcripts as many med schools are P / F these days. I think Northwestern is the happy medium between Harvard and the easy road at Brown. And this doesn\u2019t even account for the fact that Chicago &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Providence in terms of a city. Good luck.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>Exactly, that\u2019s why I would go with Brown. The 3.7 requirement is too extreme. Someone who gets into a program like this is undoubtedly capable of meeting it but the whole point of a BS/MD program is to provide an applicant with some certainty. I don\u2019t think you have that if the requirements are so stringent.<br>Additionally, while NU (Feinberg) is a better med school than Brown (Alpert), medical school prestige doesn\u2019t matter half as much as B-school/law school prestige IMO. I think the student should go to Brown, explore his/her non-medical interests and then begin medical school. The 3 year undergrad at NU could be viewed as a positive but the 4 year Brown degree (with fewer pre-med requirements) will give the student more intellectual freedom.<br>I would take Harvard over the NU program. If you have to get a 3.7 anyway, you might as well go to Harvard and get as close to a 4.0 as possible. That way you have all your options open in the future.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@JenniferClint nails it!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Tigerle</b><br><br>If you go with Brown, you can spend a year abroad without having to worry about your GPA at all, and focus entirely on public health in another country. Invaluable insights.<br><br>", "<b>Username: IWannaHelp</b><br><br>@JenniferClint<br>There\u2019s a big gap between 4.0/3.9 and 3.7.  The former allows very little margin; even an A- is a setback.  3.7 GPA at NU is not extreme considering any top-20 med schools these days require close to 3.9 avg GPA, even in science.  Science GPA requirement for HPME is only 3.5. It\u2019s reasonable to predict that if you can\u2019t get 3.7 GPA at NU when NU undergrads already have an average GPA of around 3.5, you will likely struggle at NU med school. It seems to me the requirement serves to confirm the high school record wasn\u2019t a fluke and the candidate has what it takes to handle NU med school.

With one medical school admission (most who get admitted get only one), you take it or leave it, with no choice between medical schools based on cost, ranking (which is not all that important in medicine, as opposed to law or business), or anything else.

First, you didn\u2019t say what state you are from.  That is critical, because most premeds, even those from Harvard, end up at their state medical schools.  Some states have fewer and some have more applicants per available spot, so your chances depend somewhat on what state you live in.  Also, you can refer to your state medical school(s) as the most likely comparison with Northwestern or Brown medical schools.<br>Second, one possibility is for you to enter the Northwestern or Brown programs and then see how you do in Organic Chemistry and on the MCATs.  If you are a very strong applicant, you might be able to drop out of the M.D. part of the program and apply as a regular applicant to medical schools.  I know someone who did this from the Brown program.  I also know someone who was in the BS/MD program at Michigan (which no longer exists), then transferred to another undergraduate institution, then applied as a regular premed, and then attended a top medical school.<br>Third, you need to assess how risk-prone or risk-averse you are.  This is a classic problem in decision analysis, where you are comparing a safe alternative (Northwestern or Brown) versus a riskier one that has a potentially better outcome (Harvard plus a top medical school), bad outcome (Harvard plus no medical school), or something in between (Harvard plus a medical school you like less than Northwestern or Brown).

Particulary with Medical School, I feel like it is so standardized and the STEP1 Exam seems to matter more so that it really is more about the location, culture, and specific research interests than it is about the #19 school vs. #35 school. And when I think about this, I also think,  \u201cwell, in that case, I should probably pick Harvard anyways, since I really love the school and if getting into a top 5/10/20 med school is not my priority, I should be fine as I ought to be able to get into a top 60ish school with a Harvard degree\u201d.

His direction was a little different from yours. He decided PLME. However, because we have had a few conversations about this decision, I thought that I would share my thoughts.<br>The Brown PLME program seems to \u201cfree you up\u201d to actually pursue whatever you want in undergrad without having to deal with the stress of the \u201cpremed grind\u201d and studying for MCATs. Sure, there are some requirements\u2014but relatively easy to fulfill given the \u201copen\u201d curriculum.<br>For you, this can mean focusing on public policy:<br>https://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/plcy/<br>Also, as a PLME, you could take a year to get an advanced degree or take an internship: https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/plme/current-students/enrichment-activities/advanced-scholarship<br>If are particularly interested in public policy type of work, you have an opportunity as a PLME to apply to a combined program:<br>Masters in Public Affairs.<br>https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/education-programs/mdmpa-program/mdmpa-program-admissions<br>https://watson.brown.edu/mpa/apply/md-mpa<br>I am not as familiar with HPME. However, I did have a colleague who went through the program, and he was a faculty member with me at a top medical school. He was successfully (i.e. grant-funded) engaged in clinical and bench research. I also have a few friends who went to Harvard undergrad and got accepted to well respected medical schools and are all successful.<br>So ultimately, any of your current options are extremely viable. I suspect that you will do well regardless of the path that you take\u2014just recognize that some of the paths may be much more challenging than others.<br><br>", "<b>Username: truthquest</b><br><br>Your choices are the equivalent of a kid in a candy shop.   You do not really need an easier route because you are going to prepare for your craft no matter what \u2013 that is why Brown softens the requirements \u2026because it knows you don\u2019t need motivation to properly prepare your career. HOWEVER, just because you are good with dealing with stress does not mean that you should be ok with it.  Stress at low levels are ok, but with big ticket stressors like what your org chem grade is going to be or \u2014you have to get an A in x class to keep a 3.7 gpa for the quarter\u2026 is arbitrary pressure that will not make you a better doctor.  It really is about knowing yourself and quality of life and for that reason\u2026 none of us can ultimately move the needle for you.  Love to hear about what you decided.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stud3nt10</b><br><br>@confusedcat123<br>A BS/MD program shouldn\u2019t be seen as a \u201cshortcut\u201d. I understand that taking the MCAT and standardized exams overall provides good experience especially in terms of self-studying, managing multiple things, stress and finding your individual method to efficiency. However, the time that you would spend studying and agonizing over the MCAT, you could spend doing other classes (relevant to your other interests), research or clinical work, also important as you continue your med journey.<br>By the way, would you mind giving your stats?<br><br>", "<b>Username: theloniusmonk</b><br><br>\u201cThe single greatest gift she has ever received in college is taking orgo pass fail\u201d<br>That\u2019s a little odd, that\u2019s a class you want to take for a grade so you challenge yourself.  I\u2019ve brought this up before, do you really want a civil engineer to take a structural mechanics course (or whatever is the weed out course), barely pass, and build a bridge?<br>\u201cBrown is NOT helping you with a 3.0 GPA requirement.\u201d<br>I would agree with this, one of my good friends went to Brown undergrad back in the day for pre-med and he said med schools want to see the grades of all your classes, so p/f was not an option for him.  I would slightly lean to NU because it\u2019s a better med school and you get to switch campuses at med school, so it\u2019s not the same scene for 7 or 8 years, as someone mentioned above.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Oh come on @theloniusmonk .<br>Your telling us you don\u2019t get the difference between working hard/challenging yourself and life or death stress?

Ancedotally  my friend at Brown, went to Hopkins, so from my vantage, it\u2019s great for pre-med if it gets you into the best med school!  Pre-med should not be cut-throat but it should be competitive, not relaxing.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bluebayou</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>Orgo is used as a weedout class because med school classes, like orgo, require memorizing a lot of material in a short period of time.<br>\"\"<br><br>Not quite.  Gen Chem is where you can get away with just memorizing stuff, and a few formulas.<br>Organic is a class that requires visualization and critical thinking/reasoning skills in addition to memorization, but the hard part is how to apply those memorized facts.  That is why the \u2018C\u2019 students who stick it out can do much better second term once they \u2018get it\u2019.

I know others in your shoes who turned down guaranteed MD and later got into Tufts Med school.  If you are even supposed to go to med school, you will know in about two or three years after you take health policy classes and and take time to work with patients over summers.   Might as well take the MCAT. Its one of those rights of passage ??!!!  Have fun in Cambridge. Better location than frozen Lake Michigan or Providence.  Enjoy soup dumplings at Shanghai Fresh on Mass Ave across from the Post Office !!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Providence is a much better than take than Cambridge. And I love Cambridge.  Cambridge has gotten a bit sketchy.  Providence is the foodie capital and totally hip arts scene. The ocean and med tech hub.  College hill is tree lined and super clean and fun. All students and risd too.<br>Where do people get their information?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>Agree. Evanston is a beautiful upscale community along the shores of Lake Michigan.<br>Tufts Medical School is ranked at #50 (along with UMass-Worcester) and for Primary Care is ranked at #55 (along with Hofstra, Eastern Virginia, Missouri & Mount Sinai).<br>Regardless, all grads are still called doctor.<br>Just a bit surprising for one who is committed to medical school to turn down two amazing opportunities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Also Alpert medical school has.  Brand new buildings on the bay, brand new student apartments the Wexford innovation zone and billion dollar med tech and science incubator zone. The whole new med and science zone is exploding. Wonderful place for a young person. Providence is in the downtown and college hill zone is one of the best places in the world to be a student right now. And the influence of the world class culinary school at Johnson and Wales can be felt city wide.<br>And a quick trip to Newport and the world renowned beaches in 45 minutes.<br>Really.

Out of hundreds of phone calls and messages I have never heard once she complained about there being too many tourists.  I guess one gets used to it quickly.<br>But you do see all kinds of visitors on campus.  Two days ago I got a text from my DD saying Bill Clinton just walked by.

Some not so much.<br>FWIW.<br>On the brown on campus in the past few years I\u2019ve seen Sting, had lunch next to Larry David at Andreas, stood in line at the bookstore next Steven Spielberg, saw Emma Watson a load of times and jack Nicholson at city sports  and Phil Michelson several times.
