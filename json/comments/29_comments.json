I recently visited Vanderbilt for the fist time and absolutely LOVED it -- I know that if I went there, I would have a fantastic time. Everything about it, from the weather, to the campus, to the girls, to Nashville, is perfect. But honestly, I just don't know if I can turn down the prestige of Penn or Duke simply because of seemingly less important factors such as those. I have this feeling that later in life I may regret choosing Vanderbilt, when it comes to employment/grad school/other opportunities. Am I wrong? Is there anybody on here who would like to convince me that I should in fact choose Vandy?<br><br>", "<b>Username: CityEntrepreneur</b><br><br>I'd go to Duke or Penn.

Ultimately, job placement is a lot about who you were able to network with, and not just a function of where you went to school. There are of course Vandy students who end up with better jobs than Duke or UPenn students. Your undergraduate degree is really only going to matter for your very first job anyway. It's the next four years of your life you should be focusing on--a time when you are going to be making friends and memories that will last long after you've quit Job #1. You may go to UPenn and end up in a job you could have just have easily gotten through Vandy-- then what will you be regretting?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Faline2</b><br><br>duke and vandy grads parent here--bud123 is right on, plus he really made me laugh out loud re half the country<br>celebrating when your basketball team loses. I will hold off and not agree with the remark about the lack of pretty girls however in comparison out of the sisterhood with the gals at all 3 fabulous universities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Commodore15</b><br><br>First, congratulations on all three acceptances. Very, very impressive.<br><br>A few things to consider:<br><br>Prestige does still lean towards Duke and Penn, but this is changing very quickly. Most people with an opinion on the subject consider either Vandy or USC to be the most rapidly improving school in the country. Each incoming class at Vanderbilt over the last four or five years has been more qualified than the one before it. I'm a current junior at Vandy, and would say that there is definitely a perceivable difference in the overall caliber of students in just my year and those of the current graduating senior class. However, even this senior class is far more qualified than those of recent years. It's safe to say that the level of achievement in Vanderbilt's student body has only recently caught up with that of the student bodies at either Duke or Penn. Hence, comparing a student's job opportunities out of Vandy with what they'd get out of Duke or Penn wasn't really fair until very recently, as better opportunities out of Duke or Penn would have largely owed to the students at Duke/Penn just being more qualified.<br><br>I think the only area where Duke and Penn have traditionally had an edge is in placement into jobs in investment banking and management consulting, as recruiters in both industries have, in the past, focused their efforts exclusively upon the ivies, Duke, and Stanford. Again, I speak from firsthand experience, and can tell you that this is changing rapidly. Vandy's placement into MBB (McKinsey, Bain, and BCG -- the top three management consulting firms) now vs. what it was even two years ago is a night-and-day comparison (eight current seniors entering Bain alone this year vs. maybe five, in total, entering any one of the three a few years ago). Placement into bulge bracket investment banks has improved even more dramatically. In the current senior class, there are at least two headed to each of the bulge brackets besides UBS. This is the fourth year in a row for which Vandy has been a core school (top three in # of recruits) at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and it is guaranteed to repeat as a core school next year because BAML just extended 11 summer analyst offers to members of the junior class (might be a record. Summer analyst class size is below 100, so over 10% could be from Vandy). All of that said, I might add that Penn would still give you an edge (and a significant one) if you have been accepted to Wharton. The only school in the country that could rival Wharton for placement into \"business\" jobs is Harvard, and Wharton's network is still better than Harvard's because there aren't as many Harvard graduates targeting these jobs. Conversely, if you're at Penn but not in Wharton, your opportunities may actually be worse than advertised, as many employers exclusively target Wharton students when they recruit. I realize that this whole paragraph has focused exclusively on investment banking and management consulting -- which probably mean very little to you, still being in high school -- but your opportunities for everything else will unquestionably be very similar at any of the three schools. Networking is where Duke/Penn have the edge, but this edge is far smaller and far less important for jobs in other industries.<br><br>Grad school placement should not at all factor into this decision, as it will be similar coming from any of the three. You wouldn't enter business school until several years after you finish your undergraduate career, and at that point your work experience, GMAT, and GPA would be far more important than where you did your undergrad. Law school acceptance is exclusively predicated on your LSAT and your GPA. Medical school acceptance is similar to law school acceptance in that test scores (MCAT) and GPA are huge components, but your research experience is also weighted heavily; fortunately, all three have enormous medical centers and plenty of labs, and make research experience easy to obtain. Placement into Masters/PhD programs in any subject comes down to your GPA, GRE, and research/thesis/recommendations from professors, which shouldn't necessarily differ coming from any of the three.<br><br>You really cannot go wrong here. All three schools will leave every door open to you in the future. Also, kudos to you for thinking about this maturely; you'll be successful wherever you end up. Best of luck in making your decision, and congrats again on the acceptances!<br><br>", "<b>Username: LHSCary</b><br><br>I can contribute absolutely nothing to the discussion on investment banking but wanted to point out that Bill Bain is a graduate of ... Vanderbilt University :-)<br><br>", "<b>Username: Confucious2014</b><br><br>What major is the OP interested in ? If pre-med etc isn't Vandy grade deflation a concern as compared to grade inflation at Duke ( I don't know about inflation/deflation but just parroting what i have read on CC)<br><br>", "<b>Username: Commodore15</b><br><br>LHSCary - I'm not completely sure whether your comment is supposed to add to or detract from mine.<br><br>You are correct that Bill Bain is a Vanderbilt alumnus. However, I don't think that that's why Vandy's placement into Bain is as good as it is. He graduated back in 1959, yet Vandy's only recently become one of Bain's targets.<br><br>", "<b>Username: LHSCary</b><br><br>My comment was flippant--I too doubt Bill Bain has any influence on Vanderbilt being a recruiting target for Bain. I guess I was trying to show that people who are highly successful in business (and also education, medicine, law, politics etc.) have graduated from Vanderbilt over the years; VU doesn't currently have the national reputation of Duke or Penn but it is a very fine school that prepares its students well for med school, law school or business school or for the workforce. The original poster can't go wrong with any of the choices but shouldn't base a decision solely on prestige; comfort/happiness while in school are more likely to lead to better grades and thus a better chance of getting into grad school. Best of luck with your ultimate decision!<br><br>", "<b>Username: javalava</b><br><br>If you'd asked me this 2 years ago when I was applying, I would've picked Duke or UPenn, no questions asked. That decision would've been based nearly 100% on college rankings and rumors. That being said, there is no question Duke and UPenn have more diverse programs in A&amp;S, a greater international reputation, ethnic diversity, and more intellectual/nerd culture on campus. Penn also has Wharton, which is infinitely better and more well-connected than the HOD/Managerial Sciences minors at Vanderbilt.<br><br>THAT BEING SAID: I'll cut the obligatory comments about great academics, beautiful campus, location, etc.<br><br>Here's why I would pick Vandy.<br><br>The College Experience- SEC Football.

The most attractive people you have ever seen in your life (this is not a lie or an exaggeration).<br><br>Every friend I have who has visited has commented on how well put-together and social the campus is. Vanderbilt will turn a homebody into the life of a party, and force you to learn socializing and networking skills that will take you farther in your career than any class/mock interview ever can. Ultimately, it teaches you to be confident and this is a skill that is far more important for your social life and professional life than you'd think. Personal growth happens outside the classroom. There are so many student organizations and student communities for you to take part of.<br><br>In the end, when you're crusty and old, you want to look back on college and remember all the cool things you did and all the cool people you meet.

This is all coming from an Asian, pre-med student who was 100% prejudiced against the South and dreaded going to Vandy senior year.<br><br>One final comment: I will also add that the culture on campus is VERY rapidly changing and disappearing, as the college attracts more grade-focused students uninterested in greek life. Our acceptance rate is plummeting, and the academic quality of each incoming class is more terrifying elite than the next, at a rate that far exceeds any other college in the US (except USC maybe). I predict in these 10 years will be the last that a student gets to enjoy the party culture on campus before it disappears. It's just impossible to maintain that kind of dichotomy. So come before it's gone ;)<br><br>", "<b>Username: Pancaked</b><br><br>I wouldn't say the culture is very rapidly changing and disappearing. The face of Greek life may slowly be changing as Vandy gets stricter on their behavior, but I don't think we're ever going to see Vandy lose its highly social campus. The Commons and lack of off-campus housing really encourage an active social scene.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doubleeternity</b><br><br>I am no believer in rankings, but I do agree that they are meaningful indicators.

They are PEOPLE, not things. The more Vanderbilt hopefuls post about and rank the \"girl\" factor, the less of a reason it is to go there. What girl wants to be constantly judged on her looks for four years?<br><br>", "<b>Username: vandyman</b><br><br>pilgrim6, I think the girls comment is meant to be a snide remark about how boys sometimes decide on a college. I agree that it can become annoying rather than funny. But to be fair, I've heard high school girls frequently discuss the \"boys\" factor when ranking their college preferences. I tend to take this sort of discussion lightly, but I'm old and jaded.<br><br>FWIW, I thought my son would care about this factor, but he didn't. He did however care about the social life (\"culture\"), and is greatly enjoying VU, and all his new friends (of either gender). And to echo something said above, he's extremely driven. He talks about the \"work hard, play hard\" motto that seems to pervade, and likes that a lot.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Commodore15</b><br><br>javalava, very fair points, and I would agree that the social scene at Vanderbilt is really, really unique among top schools. You will not find a social scene nearly as vibrant and thriving until you drop down to USC on the USNews rankings.<br><br>Regarding your point about Penn and Duke still holding an edge in terms of \"more diverse programs in A&amp;S, a greater international reputation, ethnic diversity, and more intellectual/nerd culture on campus\", I would say that I agree to some extent, but that the schools' differences in these regards, at least between Vanderbilt and Duke, are marginal at best. I'll address each separately:<br>1) Concerning the diversity of programs in A&amp;S, I actually don't know that I agree with your point. Are there certain majors that Penn and Duke sponsor that Vandy does not? Vandy also allows the option of creating one's own concentration, and is similar to Penn in the latter's \"One University\" policy, which allows undergrads to take classes in any of its schools. I can't think of one thing one would want to study that is offered in A&amp;S at Duke or Penn -- or at any comparable institution's undergraduate curriculum, for that matter -- that is not also available at Vanderbilt.<br>2) Where greater international reputation is concerned, I agree. However, the difference between Duke and Vandy in this regard is especially negligible. People overseas know that the ivy league, Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, and Caltech are excellent universities. Duke may be well-known because of its basketball, but it's still far from achieving its due recognition, and is much less acclaimed internationally than, say, Cornell -- which it is certainly at least the equal of. Penn beats both by a wide margin in this regard, so if this is important, then neither Vandy nor Duke would be good choices when Penn is also an option.<br>3) Regarding ethnic diversity and a more intellectual/nerdy culture on campus -- yes, this is where I agree with you most (as in, I think these are the most likely areas where any meaningful difference may exist). However, I again have some reserves about claiming that Duke excels in either of these areas; I am sure that it tops Vandy, but I don't know whether it does so by any significant margin. Furthermore, the OP and any others in similar situations should evaluate the importance of ethnic diversity and intellectualism to them on a personal level. To some, neither is at all important. To others, one or both are extremely important. Both are more about personal preference than anything else. Many students actually find themselves wishing for less intellectualism. One can simply be exposed to enough intellectual thought within classes that the idea of discussing \"the history of modern political thought\" or something similarly esoteric over lunch, at the gym, and at night with one's roommate while falling asleep is exhausting. It is also conceivable that, for reasons other than bigotry, one might prefer a lower level of ethnic diversity (this is not my preference, however, and I believe that ethnic diversity is a key area where Vandy needs to catch up). A university like Harvard, which is probably the gold standard in student body ethnic diversity, is far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of diversity. The diversity a Harvard graduate experiences in nearly any setting will never compare to what they experienced while in college. There are undoubtedly consequences to this, but because I actually believe ethnic diversity is highly important, and because I do not want to start an argument on the topic, I will not detail them.<br>I will, however, state that, if Penn and Duke are seen as offering tremendous advantages because of higher ethnic diversity and/or intellectualism, that these same benefits can be had quite easily at Vandy, too. Yes, African Americans may comprise 2% less of the student body at Vanderbilt than they do at Duke (I'm pulling this number out of my ***, but it illustrates a point). It would still be preposterous to think that this impedes one in making friends with African Americans, or in attaining a new perspective through engaging in debates or discussions with African Americans. Intellectualism/nerdiness is not at all hard to find at Vanderbilt. You simply cannot enroll a class of 1600 with an average SAT score of 2250 (or whatever it is) and expect it to not be tremendously nerdy. I do not consider myself a particularly intellectual person, but I have gone deaf in the ears in my nearly three years here from long discussions with friends, hallmates, and professors about random dilemmas concerning ethics, morals, politics, philosophy, science...you name it. Most students here are very intellectual, and if they were significantly more so, I assure you that I would not at all be having a well-rounded college experience.<br><br>Essentially, I think that your point about international reputations may be worth a further look, but I don't think that a college decision should hinge on either of the other two. In fact, I think international reputation may also be a bit far removed from the realm of important factors here, since even a degree from Penn will not, on its own, open many doors abroad, and since even attempting to market a degree abroad is still something that a very small number of US graduates do. Additionally, top liberal arts colleges like Williams and Amherst have essentially zero recognition abroad, but many still choose them over Penn, Duke, and Vanderbilt each year.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Commodore15</b><br><br>Where these schools really may hold a meaningful edge over Vanderbilt is with respect to their reputations within the US. All three universities are remarkably similar at a high level; they are all mid-sized research universities, with similar incoming undergraduate class profiles.<br><br>Penn and Duke have better reputations than Vanderbilt for two reasons:<br><br>The first is that Vanderbilt has only recently become a peer of Penn and Duke. While graduating classes from all three are likely at very similar levels of accomplishment now, this was definitely not the case 20 years ago. As a result, Penn and Duke have longer track records of distinguished alumni, which is why Penn and Duke students have an edge in alumni networking. However, this is an edge that should become less and less important as Vanderbilt continues to produce graduating classes of its current caliber. Furthermore, because recent alumni are usually the most helpful when networking, this edge should erode rapidly, as Vandy's recent and soon-to-be graduating classes are by far its most accomplished.<br><br>Second, while all three are research universities, Vanderbilt likely has a stronger undergraduate focus than either Duke or Penn. As proof of this, consider that Vanderbilt provides tenure to Professors based primarily upon undergraduate teaching ability. I know of no other tier-1 research university that can also make this claim. This necessarily compromises a research focus, and as research is what brings in fame and prestige, certainly may also compromise recognition, especially vis--vis schools like Penn and Duke. However, as an incoming undergraduate, it might pay to ask oneself whether it is more important that one's Professors be renowned for research, or be renowned for teaching. Yes, having classes taught by a famous Professor is a perk, but I assure you that anyone with a PhD in a subject knows more than enough to teach an undergraduate class in the same subject. What matters far more in a Professor than fame for an undergraduate's learning are qualities like charisma and a genuine interest in instructing students. I've taken two math courses at Vanderbilt taught by a brilliant, renowned European mathematician, but he was hard to understand and I regret having taken both. A lack of research (side note: Vanderbilt does not have a lack of research. Vanderbilt is a top research university in terms of both funding and output; I only mean to suggest that it focuses slightly more on undergraduates and slightly less on research than its peers) is also the primary reason why excellent schools like Williams, Amherst, Swarthmore, etc. -- which offer what many consider the premier undergraduate learning experience, at least in the US -- suffer in renown relative to their research university peers. Superb undergraduate education, however, is also why these top liberal arts colleges are celebrated, despite a lack of \"accomplished\" faculty.<br><br>To summarize everything, I do believe that Penn and Duke will give you an edge. This edge, however, will stem from superior alumni networking opportunities, which will become better and better for Vanderbilt students over just the next few years. Furthermore, this edge is nothing that cannot be overcome by simply being marginally more proactive, and Vanderbilt's opportunities are excellent enough as is that this extra effort may still not be needed. The point at which Vanderbilt's name will catch up to either Penn's or Duke's is years into the future, but many top liberal arts colleges suffer from far less name recognition, so clearly this is something that many are able to overlook when settling upon a school. Furthermore, the social scene at Vanderbilt is unique among top schools, and the undergraduate experience in general is something the school is very committed to.<br><br>There is absolutely reason to pick Vanderbilt over either Penn or Duke. However, all three are excellent choices.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Commodore15</b><br><br>Also, decisions like this happen all the time. Consider this article:<br><br><url>http://www.insidevandy.com/news/administration/article_d27c4b32-3622-11e3-be58-0019bb30f31a.html</url><br><br>which states:<br><br>\"Additionally, Vanderbilts overlap in terms of admissions with competitor schools has intensified in recent years. Duke University is still the No. 1 school Vanderbilt competes with to attract freshmen, but Yale has risen from being the No. 21 competitor to the No. 2 competitor, meaning admitted freshmen must increasingly choose between Yale and Vanderbilt. Harvard has risen from No. 10 to No. 3 in terms of overlap.\"<br><br>This was for the Class of 2017, who are currently rising sophomores. Vanderbilt's yield rate (% of admitted students who end up enrolling) was 40.7% for the Class of 2017, which is fairly common for schools in this range (Duke, Penn, Northwestern, Brown, etc). Hence, nearly 41% of all students admitted to Vanderbilt end up enrolling.<br><br>Consider that, because they are very similar schools, Duke and Vanderbilt must share an enormous number of cross-admits. In fact, Duke, Vanderbilt, the ivies, and all other top schools share an enormous number of cross admits with one another. If Vanderbilt lost nearly every battle to just its top three competitors in cross-admits -- Duke, Yale, and Harvard -- it would likely have to be winning an unusually large majority from schools like Penn, Dartmouth, Brown, and Northwestern in order to maintain a 41% yield rate. What's more likely is that Vanderbilt is winning a fair share of the admit battles with each of these schools.<br><br>Last year, VUceptors (upperclassmen who serve as mentors to groups of freshmen throughout their first semester at Vandy) were given information packets with data on cross-admit statistics, which corroborated some of the above. Vandy's split with schools like Brown and Duke was extremely close -- something between 40/60 and 45/55. It won heavily against Rice and Emory, and lost much more frequently against schools at the very top, like Harvard and Yale. I realize that this information is not made publicly available, so it has to be taken at less than face value. However, the article above should show that Vanderbilt is quite frequently chosen over schools that currently enjoy greater recognition.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Commodore15</b><br><br>If you want to be really particular, it's more like Wharton >>>> Duke > Penn >= Vanderbilt.<br><br>I just went through the summer analyst recruiting process for investment banking, and am familiar with the undergraduate school representation for incoming analyst and summer analyst classes at most large banks. In general, Wharton probably has 10-15 kids heading to each BB. Duke has 3-4, and Vanderbilt has 2-3 (although it has very lopsided success at BAML, in particular).<br><br>A school's past banking alumni will tell you very little about its current recruiting. There's correlation there for sure, in that schools like Harvard and Wharton who have tons of alumni in banking still have great recruiting to this day, but that's not at all a reliable criterion.<br><br>", "<b>Username: njlokk</b><br><br>Update: I visited Penn last week, and for various reasons have decided it would not really be a great fit for me.<br>It's now between Duke and Vandy, and I am still having a really tough time deciding. In terms of what I am interested in studying, I will likely major in International Relations or Political Science, with possibly a minor in Economics. I also have a strong interest in languages (French and Spanish mainly). I know various posters mentioned differences in international recognition; this may be relevant to me, as I would definitely be interested in living/working abroad in the future if possible (ideally in Europe). I don't know if these details would help at all in providing me with advice, but I thought I'd share them in case they do.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Faline2</b><br><br>Choosing between Duke and Vandy should be a very tough call. Our Duke son just came home from his five year reunion and talked to me about how much he is still thrilled with Duke and how much it changed his life, how great his classmates are, how wonderful his academics were. Our Vandy son would not have enjoyed it there as much..as it was important to him to explore Nashville and all the area on foot around the Vandy campus which is decidedly more fun town/gown than Duke. I think you have to look at the intangible fit factors for yourself. Also you should be doing some critical thinking on the academic pathway you are most interested in if you are one of the few people who won't change his or her mind in a year. For instance, if you are interested in French or Spanish..look more deeply in the department for their immersion offerings which I am sure are many! There is a diff between a shared academic venture abroad with other universities and a program that is specific to an institution. ie our Vandy son went to Copenhagen and lived with three other men from different colleges doing different things, our Duke son opted for a program in Berlin that was taught only to Duke/Davidson students..and it was much more personal and also more satisfying. Vandy has its own signature programs abroad, as well as shared programs. Take a look at Vandy's program in France and in Spanish speaking cities...you may turn up some fabulous information as a semester abroad is not to be missed no matter where you end up. Vandy has its own program in Washington DC which is really well-run that Vandy son did once. The Gates Foundation at Duke funds tons of vetted out proposals by Duke students that are service related foreign programs. The school of public policy at Duke is pretty sophisticated and there is someone from the state department on campus.<br><br>Economics is very rigorous at both schools. Duke has a lot of Econ majors (Duke son was in Econ)...it is one of the lead majors on campus and it is a tough pathway.<br><br>The details you share in your last post don't really tell us anything to recommend one school strongly over the other. The social atmospheres of the two universities vary somewhat. Vandy wins hands down in town/gown synergy and location. In my opinion, the student bodies are equally talented and both campuses are simply wonderful with Vandy perhaps winning in terms of residential housing and their two years of residential colleges. Duke has an illustrious history in sports that binds the students together.<br><br>Academically, you can make either college sing. I would watch youtube videos re Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke..they have a lot of in house lectures from significant people and they do put each of their majors into internships. One of Vandy son's majors was poli sci with an emphasis on international relations. I think he would comment that many of his classes were small and had discussion options and only a couple were large survey classes. He also spent two summers in Washington DC with the support of his Vandy profs.<br><br>good luck with your terrible probelm...:).

There is also no doubt that Vanderbilt is on an extreme upswing and its rankings, nationally and internationally, have not yet caught up with the quality of the student body, which is as good or better than that of Penn and Duke (judging by test scores).<br><br>", "<b>Username: Rooster10</b><br><br>@njlokk, You did the right thing in going and visiting the campuses. Really it is going to come down to where you feel is a great fit. My only regret is that you didn't go to Vandy over its Rites of Spring Weekend, which is consistently ranked as one of the best College Music Festivals. (If you had I am sure you would have chose Vandy). I was like you and my decision came down to Vandy and Duke, and I chose Vandy. I have never regretted it. There are a lot of Duke grads that I know that seem incredulous that I would choose Vandy over Duke, and that *gasp* I would enjoy myself and become successful. Malcolm Gladwell wrote in his book David and Goliath, and he broke down how college rankings were not a great indicator of future success, and how actually going to an elite college might hinder your dreams because it makes you a small fish in a big pond. The same qualities of work ethic and determination that got you into Vandy and Duke are going to get you a good job regardless of if you studied in Nashville or Durham. I graduated from Vandy, went to Johns Hopkins for my Masters and now work full time with a couple Duke grads. Surprise, we got the same job. We also work with people that went to directional state schools. It comes down to where you feel comfortable because where you are comfortable is where you will do your best. To me, I enjoyed Nashville much more than I enjoyed Durham. I felt like both schools offered me pretty much the exact same experiences, except Vandy offered me more with the city of Nashville.<br><br>You mentioned that you are interested in Spanish, and I know I just knocked rankings, but Vandy is consistently ranked #1 for its Spanish program (or at least it was when I went there).<br><br>Getting a job internationally does not come down to where you went to school, it comes down to who you know, and if you network really well. I am sure Vandy and Duke both have alumni overseas that can put you in touch with others.<br><br>I think it is kinda foolish to judge people on where they chose to go to school because I never know their situation, but just to throw some shade at @ennisthemenace I can never understand why people chose Duke over Vandy. And neither can the research triangle business journal, who said Vandy is the more selective than Duke in the South <url>http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2011/12/13/duke-is-the-souths-second-most.html</url> (see I can post rankings too that say what I want).<br><br>", "<b>Username: oliver007</b><br><br>ennisthemenace....LOL!!! \"International Rankings\" are the last (first?) refuge of the insecure!

The student pool is identical in talent, faculty are excellent at all of them. Vanderbilt offers a much more fun and lively undergrad experience to boot! I'd say there is plenty of reason to pick it above Duke, Penn etc. Of course, the reverse is also equally true.

If you like that vibe, then fine. Also, it is so off the world radar that Vanderbilt actually has to recruit . . . ASIANS! Who has ever heard of Asians being recruited anywhere?! College applications and colleges in general are geysered with Asians, but not at Vandy. Indeed, it probably the one major school where Asians are actively recruited and where their scores and attributes actually don't disadvantage them. Any school that actually has to recruit Asians to go there (mein Got!) and touts its membership in a conference with Florida, Tennessee and Alabama (academic powerhouses, all . . .) is not yet ready for prime time.

(neither is better, just different)<br><br>maken, I think you may be about 10 years behind the times. It's 2014. Go look up the freshman commons at Vandy and the geographic population of it's students. When you catch up to 2014 please feel free to post an updated note. It's nice for Asian students to know at least one top university will treat them fairly in the application process and Vandy is well represented with Asians students (5% of USA and 9% at Vandy). 15 years ago Duke was the top dog in the Southeast. Today, students should take a look at Vanderbilt and make their own decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Commodore15</b><br><br>supernova123 - I was surprised to hear that Vandy splits cross admits with Duke and Brown, too. Especially because very marginal differences in reputation tend to translate into huge advantages in cross admit statistics (Duke's dean went on record a few years ago saying Duke beat a group of a few other schools including Cornell and Northwestern something like 75-25 or 80-20). But Vandy's changed rapidly. I also didn't say it was splitting applicants evenly; I said it was something between 40-60 and 45-55. I've heard this from multiple students on campus. Also, consider what I said about Vandy's most common overlaps in terms of cross admits being Duke, then Yale, and then Harvard. I'm going to assume, for obvious reasons, that Harvard and Yale clobber Vandy. But that leaves Duke and many other top schools that Vandy's battling with and, more than likely, winning a good number of battles against. If Vandy's losing to all of its most common cross admit overlaps, it's not going to maintain a respectable yield %. In fact, since it's probably losing nearly everyone to Harvard and Yale (as does every college outside of Princeton, Stanford, and MIT), it has to be making up for these losses with very significant win percentages against other top schools, like Duke and the lower ivies.<br><br>On the topic of international recognition, Vandy is definitely less well regarded than either Penn or Duke. However, Duke is not significantly well regarded either (Penn may be, but mostly because it's a member of the ivy league and because Wharton itself is so famous). The fact of the matter is that there are maybe 7 or 8 schools that will give you prestige that is recognized globally. They are Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Cambridge, Oxford, and perhaps UC Berkeley or Caltech. With ANY other school, you're going to suffer a significant decrease in the value of your degree in foreign countries. Furthermore, international rankings are largely predicated on research output, which should be of little or no concern to an undergraduate, except as an indication of international recognition (this may be what ennisthemenace intended, anyway). And even then, a lack of international recognition would harm alumni from schools like Williams and Amherst far more than it would those from Vanderbilt, and yet both are wonderful schools that routinely steal cross admits from even top ivies. I, personally, would not suggest international recognition as an important factor in this consideration.<br><br>makennacompton -- I'm trying very hard to not be disrespectful here, but I'm very seriously doubting your credibility after your statement about the freshman dorms at Vandy. If there is anything wrong with Vandy, it's not the Commons. Many consider the Commons to be THE NICEST freshman dorms in the entire country. They are state-of-the-art and absolutely spacious. There's a reason why Vandy ensures that tours go through the Commons and into an actual Commons dorm.<br><br>I'm trying to do very little bashing here, but Duke's freshman housing is just flat-out inferior to the Commons. The fact that Duke, which is located in Durham, would stick some of its freshmen in rooms without air-conditioning is just absurd. Freshmen at Duke also have to take a bus over to main campus for classes. The residence buildings themselves are nice, but I would still give the Commons the edge there.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SoCalDad2</b><br><br>\"\"How many Rhodes scholars can Vanderbilt lay claim to?

Then you and your daughter will have a better idea at how diverse the students are who make it into top medical schools--some from undergrad schools that are not top ranked, but students who have very impressive letters of reference, undergrad research experience, top grades, and top MCATs and evidence of character and vocation.<br>By the way, the obvious warmth and supportive atmosphere at this ceremony at Vanderbilt Med School is very similar to the undergraduate school.<br><url>http://mediasite.vanderbilt.edu/Mediasite/Play/473d924c492346b7af672e543ff34d801d</url><br><br>", "<b>Username: fondmemories</b><br><br>@faline2 \"Confidence in oneself, the ability to see the long view of a medical education and the ability to weigh the welfare of one's family... if their resources are finite....is one way to measure character.\"<br><br>So well said!<br><br>", "<b>Username: oliver007</b><br><br>asiandad: I am a doctor.

What matters forever is where you do your RESIDENCY/FELLOWSHIP, since that is where your actual practical skills are acquired, and that is where you form permanent alliances with others in the same specialty. If you or your daughter spend more than a nanosecond in making the choice between VU/Chancellor Scholarship and Duke, I am afraid you will deserve the regret that descends upon you when Med school expenses make themselves felt. Do you know that a large number of VU students just plain turn Duke down every year, and here you are vacillating over a ridiculously obvious choice??!! If resources are not unlimited for you, it would, in my opinion, be unconscionable for a child to not gratefully, humbly, and gleefully JUMP on the Vanderbilt offer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I am a PhD and work in academia. I can tell you that the place of undergraduate education really does not mean anything in this part of the world. I am sure only the last place of your education/training matters in the post-undergraduate level. I know there are kids who weigh between a Vandy merit scholarship and HYP.

It is time to introduce your child to an adult world where bites are taken out of your paycheck for taxes, and food, and insurance, and the mortgage and that repair bill for your daughter's violin bow (come on, admit it, your daughter plays at least one musical instrument). These bites out of the paycheck are only concepts our children hear about on the news. They have no idea that these things are real.<br><br>My daughter (a newly minted William &amp; Mary Econ grad) has twice my IQ and a GREAT job and she still thinks driving involves little more than paying for gas.

How about having that $176 grand in your pocket four years from now? Things will change. It is at least 1% possible that she will want to go to grad school for painting in Italy in lieu of medical school.

Medicare and Obamacare will reimburse you the same amount no matter what your student loans look like.<br>Since Vandy is offering you a scholarship go to Vandy. If Duke offered you a full ride and Vandy would cost you an extra $176K I would recommend you go to Duke.<br>As for grad/med school I believe about 40% of Vandy students go and 71% are accepted into their first choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SoCalDad2</b><br><br>\"\"Vanderbilt is not an elite school.

Need to work on this for my second kid. btw, I didn't even have to explain all this to DD, I just showed her this thread and Duke thread. @thecoldeye @oliver007 request you guys to post more on CC ( like @faline2) and impart your wisdom. Thank you so much<br><br>", "<b>Username: Faline2</b><br><br>Our kids--your kid, lovingasiandad- are very honorable young people because of their outstanding work ethics and they have most definitely taken on some of the best of the values of their parents, teachers and other mentors they have been around in their most tender years. But they are works in progress. Their frontal lobes aren't finished. Everyone, even middle aged people with aging, complete, brains--indulges in fantastical thinking. Which is why I refer to Duke as \"we gave our son a Pony.\" (something all little girls in the sixties asked their parents for) I asked for a white pony with brown spots every year of my girlhood despite the fact that we lived in military housing and moved every 18 months. Despite the disappointment of no Pony, I did grow up stronger from moving from one part of the US to another region regularly.<br><br>This has become a joke among my friends...as frankly the Fantastical Thinking lapses re how to fund our children's higher education-- begins with parental fantastical thinking, not the 18 year old.<br><br>I speak as a parent who would like to do more for our sons, and for our honorable first born child, pre-recession, we just closed our eyes and let him choose among the jewels where he received admittance. We also ended up with a second mortgage after Duke, declining home valuation after the recession, a decline in the financial markets that affected job opportunities for all Econ graduates (not just our Dukie) and to live to tell Duke son we are unable to help him with graduate school. (We could have --if he had taken his Echols at UVA or his honors admission to William and Mary.) But...we bought him a Pony.<br><br>Graduate school for a future MBA is not as critical for someone in the medical fields because they really want you to work for 4-6 years with your undergrad degree first. Duke son has an interesting job in a major city and will start taking MBA classes in an evening program while working full time. He has already replaced the used car we helped him get on his own. He walks like a young man who can pay his own way..and he has-- for five years already. He really can't afford to give up his job because it has great potential and is a great match for him so...night school it is! There were times when his fellow Dukies were going to grad school on their parents' dime that he felt a little forlorn but I think he garners respect in his workplace because he has achieved financial independence.<br>We still have our Chancellor Scholar at Vandy's graduate loans to stare down and strategize over.<br><br>Your daughter is honorable, just as our sons are honorable. But just like in earlier phases of parenting...it is a form of child neglect not to teach them the realities of this world. Our Vandy grad is one of the most earnest, honest, hard-working 23 year olds you will ever meet and he has a very modest paying job in a desirable place. He is paying all his bills except his car payment! We have asked him to look at his income and to evaluate what he would have to do to take over the last year of payments on his car. He looked....Astonished! It's not that he is a selfish entitled person---he often had little paid jobs around town....but he has had his head stuck in books for 23 years. His income won't allow for him to pay for his vehicle. I am glad he is starting to realize what financial autonomy requires. If he waited tables on weekends, he might be able to close the gap re the car payments...see where I am heading? By the time he gets to graduate school, he will be so anxious to be autonomous that we think he will be doing all the math on his own.<br>autonomy feels good! I remember being 23 and receiving nothing from my parents. each one of these hard working kids has a path that may take longer or may take deep strategizing, but the goal is autonomy. So sad!

I believe her. I also believe that she does not know what she is talking about. In just my circle of friends, I know physicians who do not want to be physicians. These people went through med school and training with (compared to your daughter) an informed belief that medicine was for them. They were wrong. Is it possible that your 18 year old could be wrong? Yes. Given this uncertainty, I say it is best to maintain the options that having $176,000 brings.<br><br>I think about my dermatologist. She has THREE unrelated Board Certs!

I have EVIDENCE that your daughter is very good at \"getting the grade\" in school and on standardized tests. I have evidence of nothing else.
