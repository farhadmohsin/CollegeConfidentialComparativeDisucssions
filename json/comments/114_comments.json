I am interested in running track in college, so I started looking at D3 schools. I love small class sizes to be able to engage with the professors more.

On the other hand, I have also loved the CO-OP program at Northeastern (but definitely would not be able to run track there).<br>I love the idea of small class sizes and playing a varsity sport in college, but I also am intrigued by the co-op program at Northeastern (but I could just get internships at Bates which would still be good).<br>A lot of my friends and family haven\u2019t heard of Bates like they have Northeastern, leading me to assume it is not well known (but I believe it is still a very good college).<br>My question is, will future employers much prefer Northeastern, especially with the co-op program and experience I would get from it, or should I have no problem with Bates? (if I were to get into which ever one I apply to ED).<br><br>", "<b>Username: helpingmom40</b><br><br>What is your intended major? They are both very good schools but not necessarily for the same things. Their settings are also completely different - urban city campus or  dry rural campus. If you personally want one and not the other, that would be where I would start the thought process. The other thing I like to point out is approach every school like you may not be doing a sport because injuries happen. Plus, the whole Covid situation is having a financial impact on colleges and the ripples could impact athletic budgets and programs.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ThisNameNotTaken</b><br><br>I visited NE a few years ago with D15 and Bates last fall with D21.  I pretty much concur with @helpingmom40.  The campuses are certainly totally different.  Lewiston is best described as \u201cfaded New England mill town\u201d (of which there are a lot of around here and which aren\u2019t always as sketchy as they seem).  Northeastern is more \u201cBoston but not exactly the greatest part\u201d, although it seemed fine to me.  I suspect that they are also very different \u201cculturally\u201d (whatever that means).<br>I\u2019m of a mixed opinion on the sports angle.  You definitely don\u2019t want to base your decision too heavily on that, but on the other hand if you\u2019re not ready to give it up quite yet you might find yourself having regrets if you do.  My D21 is also a T&F athlete and not quite ready to say goodbye to it yet.<br>Conversely, the CO-OP idea is cool and very well known here in New England, but I would also not base the decision too heavily on that.<br>NE (I believe) has a relatively small endowment and (this may be an urban myth) relies heavily on full pay international students.  If that\u2019s true I don\u2019t know how the COVID situation may affect that.<br>Also, I have known two recent NE students who have both been sent overseas for their first semester (one to Ireland, one to Australia).  I don\u2019t know how much choice they had in the matter, and I don\u2019t know how much COVID will affect that (I suspect a lot).   Housing issues with Boston colleges are another thing worth investigating.<br>If financial aid is an issue, look into the differences between them in that area.  I think of NE as very \u201call or nothing\u201d, but again, I could be wrong about that.<br>At least with Bates and Northeastern there isn\u2019t a ton of overlap.  They are both very well regarded, at least in New England.<br>Good luck with your decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: whidbeyite2002</b><br><br>Paging @Lindagaf, Bates parent!<br><br>", "<b>Username: ncelotto</b><br><br>@helpingmom40 my intended major is mathematics/statistics/computer science with a possible minor in neuroscience/cognitive science (to go more the Artificial Intelligence route).<br>@ThisNameNotTaken I personally love track and field. Besides the sport itself, I love being part of a team and a community. It\u2019s something that I\u2019m committed to. I believe it will help my time management skills as well as setting my priorities. I also love the small undergrad population at Bates, allowing myself to connect with the professors there (that are top level). Again, I would have to get into these schools, but currently, I\u2019m leaning towards Bates.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PengsPhils</b><br><br>@ncelotto<br>If you are strongly interested in computer science, Bates doesn\u2019t even have a department for it, much less a major. Going into AI from the software side wouldn\u2019t exactly be ideal despite the extensive math department.<br>As mentioned, Bates and Northeastern are drastically different schools in terms of the environment. If you\u2019re looking for schools with similar environments to Bates but with greater offerings in CS/AI, I\u2019d recommend checking out this post as a starting point:<br>https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/math-computer-science-majors/1814245-computer-science-at-some-smaller-schools-including-liberal-arts-colleges-p1.html<br><br>", "<b>Username: tkoparent</b><br><br>Bates is a great school, and if you love running track, running for Bates would be a wonderful experience.  We visited Bates and met with the coaches when my son was looking at schools, and the team has a very nice vibe.  He ended up at a different LAC and being part of the track team has been a very important part of his college experience.  As people have pointed out above, Bates and Northeastern are very different schools in very different environments - 18,000 undergraduates vs. 1800, Boston vs. rural Maine .  It sounds as though the small size and and community feel of Bates appeals to you, and I think you should pay attention to that.  We were lucky in that we were able to visit a wide range of schools when my son was looking.  He realized very quickly that he would be more comfortable in a small school environment, and that has proved to be the right decision for him.  I don\u2019t think you need to be concerned at all about Bates not being well-known or well-regarded among future employers, as Bates is clearly among the elite LACs.  @Lindagaf may also chime in, as her daughter just graduated from Bates.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>As suggested above, the course offerings of Bates\u2019 two-year old Digital and Computational Studies program differ substantially from those of a traditional computer science program, and would not appear to offer a strong foundation for a student with an interest in AI. Nonetheless, if you would like to run in the NESCAC, you could find several colleges from which to choose that do offer long-established computer science departments with dedicated courses in AI, along with math departments that may also offer courses in machine learning.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>With all due to respect to Pengsphil and all that Northeastern offers, I would unequivocally suggest Bates, for a number of reasons.<br>(Full disclosure, my bias is clear.)<br>I agree with everyone else that it\u2019s hard to compare these two schools. They are extremely different, for reasons that have already been mentioned. City vs small town. Small cohesive campus vs large urban. Lots of student/professor engagement in smaller classes from the outset vs larger classes and, being honest, not as much student/professor engagement.<br>Lewiston isn\u2019t quite the faded mill town it used to be, but it\u2019s not Boston, and it\u2019s not quaint or charming. Certainly in the years that we\u2019ve been visiting, it has improved dramatically and has plenty of fun places to eat, a nice river walk, a bird sanctuary next to the school, and easy access to outdoor activities. If being in a city is what you need, you won\u2019t get that. However, many students go to Portland which is nearby, and it definitely has enough on offer to give you a city fix if you need it. Bates has shuttles that run to Portland, Freeport and even Boston.<br>I think the main reason for choosing Bates is pretty simple: smaller classes from the start and a lot of student/student and student/professor interaction. It\u2019s likely you will have a superior educational experience at Bates. Getting to know professors well is a very important advantage. Good professor recommendations can be critical for research positions, scholarships, and internships.<br>I\u2019ll address your question about name recognition and jobs. My D has a well paying job due to start in October. Meanwhile, she has a paid summer job too, doing analysis for a university. As an undergrad, she had an internship and a different summer research position, for which she received a grant from Bates.<br>Bates has an excellent reputation among those who are familiar, but like many LACs, it isn\u2019t a household name. Though things recently ground to a halt, D\u2019s fellow grads are being hired: a clinical research job at a hospital, an advertising agency job, a teaching job, working for an environmental group based in the West, working in biochem, and a finance job. In short, no, her friends haven\u2019t been struggling to find jobs. One friend will be starting a prestigious year long scholarship program in the late fall. Hiring managers and grad school AO\u2019s know about Bates.<br>You are interested in NE co-op program. My D had no trouble finding a summer internship as a sophomore, and as a junior, did summer research. Everyone she knew did something similar during their summers.<br>We know a lot of students who attend or have recently graduated from Northeastern. One had to spend her first semester in Greece. One graduated in 2019 and still doesn\u2019t have full time employment. She did several really great co-ops as an undergrad, so I\u2019m not sure why she isn\u2019t employed now.<br>D\u2019s two best friends from home have tried to graduate \u201con time\u201d and every summer have taken online courses so that they can complete all their coops. (To be clear, they chose to do this because they didn\u2019t want to get a degree in five years.) One managed it, the other is still taking summer courses online to finish her degree. All three students I know well say they disliked that their friends would disappear to do co-oops and you never knew if or when you might see them again, because everyone\u2019s schedule is different. Two of her friends did co-ops that they felt were boring and \u201cuseless\u201d. Of these students, only one is currently working.<br>Northeastern unquestionably has the upper hand if CS is something of interest to you. But you can check out what @merc81 was referring to on Bates\u2019 website. https://www.bates.edu/digital-computational-studies/<br>It\u2019s a new program, but I\u2019m sure the standards are very high.<br>I am sorry to be negative about Northeastern, and I agree that for some, co-ops are clearly an excellent way to earn money and get necessary job experience. However, I wouldn\u2019t say that the students I know at NE universally loved their undergrad experience, whereas the students I know at Bates have loved their experience and they are getting jobs.<br>I am not sure, at the end of the day, if the co-op programs make a big difference in students being able to get jobs over students who don\u2019t do co-ops. Given the uncertainty of the economy at the moment, maybe co-ops will become much more important. Bates has enough of a reputation that I don\u2019t foresee you\u2019ll have trouble getting a job. I\u2019m sure Northeastern grads are also getting good jobs, but I can\u2019t help feeling that their college path may not have been quite as enjoyable.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ncelotto</b><br><br>@merc81 @PengsPhils My \u201cideal\u201d job would be a Data Scientist or something similar. Couldn\u2019t I, if I were to get in, major in mathematics at Bates and then get a Master\u2019s degree in statistics/computational statistics? Most data scientists have a master\u2019s degree, and mathematics, I have heard, is a very employable major, and can be combined with my career of interest. I think that even if I go to Northeastern, I would still be in the same position in terms of getting a Master\u2019s degree if I wanted to go into Data Science. Does that sound right, or am I missing something? Also, would you recommend any other NESCAC schools that are good for statistics mainly, or computer science? All besides Amherst, Williams, Tufts, and Middlebury, as I would not be able to run track at those colleges due to my times not being good enough. Maybe Wesleyan, Colby, or Hamilton? I am basing my decision more on academics of course, but running track is a huge added bonus that I would love to take advantage of unless I am greatly missing out on an opportunity for my education somewhere else. Thank you both for your insightful responses!<br>@tkoparent I definitely believe Bates is well regarded now that I have heard from many people. And I have a meeting with the sprinting coach of Bates tomorrow. I would love to be part of a varsity track team. It\u2019s unfortunate that COVID-19 is prohibiting myself from being able to visit college campuses, but I am trying to make the most of it!<br>@Lindagaf Thank you! Like I said earlier in this post, do you think it would be sufficient enough to major in mathematics here (if i got in) and then go on to get a Master\u2019s degree in statistics/computational statistics, etc to hopefully become a Data Scientist or something similar? I have not gotten the chance to visit due to COVID-19, but Bates seems like it would be an amazing fit academically and athletically. The coaches seem very welcoming and great and I am highly intrigued by the small class sizes, ability to build a connection with the professors, and still the opportunity to get internships and experience during my undergrad.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Sure, you can do that.

I still ideally wouldn\u2019t recommend waiting until grad school to touch that topic if you don\u2019t have to.<br>If you know you interest is in data science and you\u2019re planning to get a masters then yes, it would give you more time to develop those skills later and you\u2019d be still in a decent position. If you feel comfortable doing that, go for it, but I don\u2019t think you have to close that door to CS/AI possibilities right away if you pick a college that offers both strong math and CS/AI courses, which exist even among smaller schools that would still offer the environment you want.<br>I second the recommendations for [Haverford/b and Hamilton as schools that could offer exactly what you\u2019re looking for.<br>LAC\u2019s that offer both CS and AI: Trinity College<br>LAC\u2019s that offer CS but no AI courses, a generally small CS department but likely sufficient: Wesleyan, Colby, Connecticut College<br>I did some cursory track googling but I\u2019ll let you get into the weeds there.

It sounds like you need to make sure there\u2019s a similar environment (small classes, good professor relationships, and a place you can ideally run track at) but can also then explore schools with more extensive departments in some of your possible interests. There\u2019s no reason at this point in your search to lock into one school, and you may find that ED isn\u2019t the right option for you for any school.<br><br>\"\"<br>On the other hand, I have also loved the CO-OP program at Northeastern<br>\"\"<br><br>Is there anything else that you liked about Northeastern?

So far, it sounds like those other aspects you want aren\u2019t exactly the strength of large research universities and are best found at LAC\u2019s, but we could all be missing details here.<br>@Lindagaf<br>I didn\u2019t actually advocate for Northeastern in any of my posts in this case, but for what it\u2019s worth, none of my friends have had any issues with employment in my graduating class (2019). The selection bias of successful students tends to also help paint a rosy picture in both directions though. Anecdota is just that - you have to look at the data. Both schools offer high postgrad placement rates.<br>All of this isn\u2019t really relevant though - the question here is simply about if Bates is the right LAC depending on the level of interest in computer science / artificial intelligence given the limited offerings for the subject. Northeastern doesn\u2019t seem to be the proper comparator here, but OP may be able to elaborate more on what they liked about Northeastern and people here can help translate that into school options that hit all the criteria!<br><br>", "<b>Username: ncelotto</b><br><br>@merc81 @PengsPhils I definitely agree with you guys. I think Hamilton would be a good fit as well, but what about Colby? I heard that they have a pretty developed mathematics/statistics program and they even have a data science minor. In terms of Northeastern, the co-op program is really the biggest factor in my eyes. Although it doesn\u2019t have as many undergrads as most public schools, it still has a significant amount more than the LAC\u2019s. But I am intrigued by their combined majors as well, one of which is Data Science and Behavioural Neuroscience, which I view would almost be perfect for what I want to do. I also love the Boston area, as I have been a few times. I have been in contact with one of their admissions officers since last year when he came to my school. It also has a lot of a capella groups that compete in the ICCA and others, which I am very heavily involved with at my high school (since I wouldn\u2019t be running track at Northeastern, I would certainly join one of those). Also, they do have a club running team, which I could join, but I would definitely rather be part of a varsity team.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ncelotto</b><br><br>Wesleyan also has a data analysis minor I saw.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Midwestmomofboys</b><br><br>If the OP were willing to look outside the Northeast, Denison has both Comp Sci and Data Analytics departments/majors, plus a Neuroscience concentration. It is 25 min from Columbus airport (for ease of transportation) as well as from lots of Columbus internship opportunities. D3 athletics. Acceptance rate is about 29%.<br>As a parent, I\u2019d advise less worry about whether people have heard of a school (Bates, of course, is an excellent college), and more about whether a school meets a student\u2019s needs \u2013 academically and otherwise. Framing the decision as between Bates and Northeastern seems unnecessarily narrow. Research coop programs, if those are of interest, such as Northeastern, Drexel. And research other LACs that will offer the academic programs of interest.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PengsPhils</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>what about Colby?<br>\"\"<br><br>https://www.colby.edu/catalogue/PDF/?dept=DS<br>http://cs.colby.edu/<br>While Colby has an \u201cofficial\u201d data science minor, if you look at the requirements, you see it\u2019s almost entirely courses from the math department that you should find analogs for at most LAC\u2019s with good math programs, aka most schools discussed here.<br>As noted in my post and seen on the link above, Colby doesn\u2019t have many AI-related courses, though they do have a decently extensive CS department in that they cover the basics. I did miss they have a Neural Networks class offered in Fall 2020, so based on all that, it sounds like a good option!<br><br>\"\"<br>I am intrigued by their combined majors as well<br>\"\"<br><br>Combined majors can be a bit of the same type of thing where the \u201cofficial\u201d name is more reflective of priorities than unique coursework. While Northeastern does offer extensive classes in both areas (more than LAC\u2019s will offer), you can likely get close with a strong math/stats + CS/AI + neuroscience/cogsci department and enough flexible requirements. Most LAC\u2019s will offer enough room to make your own combined degree there, but they need to have enough classes in all three departments.<br>To really dive into this, you can basically do what I\u2019m doing: look up course catalogs and faculty size in all three areas and ensure they aren\u2019t too limited. The next step is to look at degree requirements and see how much flexibility you have, or if the school offers a \u201cmake your own major\u201d option. Even if they don\u2019t, having all three subjects means that your college choice won\u2019t limit your career or interests if they do change. If you take a CS course and decide you love it, you can then easily switch. Same for neuro/cogsci. It keeps your options open!<br><br>\"\"<br>Boston, acapella, etc<br>\"\"<br><br>That does sound good and maybe worth an application, but it\u2019s worth noting how different the experience is from a LAC. Northeastern\u2019s focus is very much on practical aspects given co-op and the preprofessional vibe isn\u2019t for everyone,. You won\u2019t get as much natural attention from profs, though it can be sought out. Class sizes will mostly be on the order of 50-100 (and things like gen chem goes as high as 200) rather than 10-20 or 20-40. It would seem to be in conflict with other things you want, but of course there are ways for both to be true so please consider it for yourself.<br>Point being, while you can likely find good things at a lot of schools, you have to consider the larger picture (hard to do without visiting, I know :/). I loved my time at Northeastern precisely because I wanted the practical focus, the city campus + lifestyle, and it has a great program for my major. But for example, even though there are some LAC\u2019s with great rock climbing clubs (something I enjoy), it wouldn\u2019t have made up for the rural locations of LAC\u2019s for me personally. You need to find what are the most important aspects in your search and prioritize those <br>I also agree on geographic expansion if you can - there are a lot more options out there that come into play.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ncelotto</b><br><br>@PengsPhils @Midwestmomofboys @merc81 @Lindagaf @tkoparent @ThisNameNotTaken @helpingmom40 Let\u2019s say we take Northeastern out of the picture for right now a focus on the LAC\u2019s. I have reached out to a good amount of LAC coaches for track and field:<br>Bates: I LOVE the coaches, the campus (from what i\u2019ve seen on virtual tours), is one of the nicest ones I\u2019m considering, its a NESCAC school (pro for me), but it lacks a comp sci and statistics department (even though a lot of math classes includes statistics concepts, which I assume is similar to most math majors at all schools).<br>Wesleyan: It is in-state for me, so I am VERY familiar with the area, also a NESCAC school, I can major in mathematics/comp sci as well as minor in data analytics (but I\u2019ve heard it is VERY liberal. I haven\u2019t mentioned this yet, but I\u2019d prefer a school that is more neutral, but it isn\u2019t too much of a big deal; just a bonus I guess).<br>Bowdoin: Coach seems great, AMAZING campus, NESCAC, but it doesn\u2019t have a real statistics department. It seems to be the most well-known and highest ranked school that have said \u201cyes\u201d to me, but I\u2019m not too sure if that matters too much.<br>Hamilton: The coach hasn\u2019t responded back yet (emailed him a few days ago), NESCAC, my friend is going there for tennis next year and he loved the campus and everything about the school, and it really does offer most/all the majors I\u2019m looking for.<br>Grinnell: The coach is pretty nice (he said that if I decide to go with Grinnell, he will \u201chelp\u201d me get in; give me assistance in admission which is super good). It has all three majors (comp sci, math, statistics). But, it is the one that is not in New England, not in NESCAC. I\u2019m not too sure I want to leave New England, but nonetheless it is a great school.<br>I was also looking at Williams, Tufts, & Middlebury, but none have responded yet and their times may be a little bit too high anyway.<br>I believe that all of these schools are pretty similar in terms of prestige and academic rigor (maybe Bowdoin is a bit above the rest (not including Williams, Tufts, & Middlebury)). So that is not too much of a worry. But from what I\u2019ve said about these schools, what you know (if I were to get into whichever one I choose), which looks like the best fit? Which one looks like the worst? Are there any that seem like a DEFINITE compared to the others? Any that seem like an obvious NO? Given both my athletic and especially academic interests.

To me the others are all roughly equivalent, with the main differentiator being location.<br>One thing I will say, having visited both Wesleyan and Bates, is that Bates (and maybe this is the administration more than the students) seemed a lot more liberal than Wesleyan, which I was not expecting.  Maybe it was because we visited Bates on \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day\u201d, so they had a few events going on.  Some of the emails we have gotten from Bates also struck me as a little \u201cout there\u201d.  FWIW I\u2019m a 60 year old white guy who self identifies as slightly left of center politically.

I honestly would never say I\u2019ve had a single communication from Bates that was anything out of the ordinary. Maybe it was indeed just the day you visited. Lewiston is modest, no question. As I said before, it\u2019s much improved over the last four years. As for the administration, they\u2019ve been doing a great job. They have made excellent improvements in my daughter\u2019s time there and Clayton Spencer has a superb pedigree and is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to the school.<br>I believe the brand new Bonney Science Center is scheduled to open in Fall 2021. They plan to offer more STEM based majors and have been actively expanding those offerings. Given the current situation, I\u2019d call or email admissions and ask these questions in more detail.<br>Bates was founded by abolitionists and was the first college in New England to admit women. There has never been Greek life on campus. If I want to sum up Bates in one word, I\u2019d say it\u2019s inclusive. It is liberal, with, IMO, a good mix of kids. Some outdoorsy types, urbanites, nerds, preppy kids, arty kids, regular kids, maybe a few social justice warriors, (but not known for that). When I was last on campus, I saw guys riding longboards, and some kids were floating around in a giant inflatable flamingo on Lake Andrews. It\u2019s know for being relaxed and friendly, and is also regarded as the more \u201carty\u201d of the Maine NESCAC\u2019s.<br>OP, you can major in Math at Bates. You could also create a Stats major. I know nothing about stats, but the link I gave earlier should give you more info. I can tell you that what my D has learned about stats has been crucial to her getting a research position and two jobs, for what that\u2019s worth.<br>I\u2019ll give you my daughter\u2019s perspective on other schools you listed, which she either visited or considered. Bear in mind, academically all of these colleges are excellent. You will get a great degree from any of them, and they will all have good math departments, but they won\u2019t all offer stats as a major.<br>I love Wesleyan, and I think it\u2019s a great school for creative, media-minded, social justice warriors and lefty intellectuals. Back in the day, it probably would have been the place for me, but my daughter thought it was too much. She thought the campus was a hodgepodge of buildings.<br>Bowdoin is a great school. Nice town. I love the little Arctic Museum on campus. My D didn\u2019t like it as she thought it looked like a big cemetery (go figure.) It\u2019s going to be the hardest to get in, apart from Williams, if you decide to apply.<br>Hamilton leans a little more conservative compared to Bates and Wesleyan. Lovely campus. Has an open curriculum, academically rigorous. I liked it, but my D felt it was too preppy.<br>Colby is also excellent, but was a little too preppy for my D, which at that time in her life, she wanted to avoid. Beautiful campus. Many people, including me, would say that Bowdoin, Colby and Bates are more alike than they are different. There is a friendly rivalry between the three. Once they\u2019ve all graduated, they respect each other as Maine NESCAC\u2019ers. It is not uncommon to see in the Weddings section of the Bates magazine that a Bates grad has married a  Bowdoin or Colby grad.<br>Grinnell is, by all accounts, an excellent school with a cool student body that is creative and intelligent. I haven\u2019t visited. My understanding is that the students are not dissimilar to Wesleyan students. It\u2019s highly regarded. And as for Iowa, I think as is the case with most LACs, you will spend most of your time on campus, so it doesn\u2019t matter too much if it\u2019s in Iowa.<br>We loved Tufts. Great location. Nice kids. I think it has a similar student body to Bates, but obviously much bigger. D didn\u2019t get in, sadly.<br>D never considered Williams or Middlebury. Williams is \u201cold-money\u201d and prestigious. Considered by many to be the Harvard equivalent of LACs. Middlebury is probably similar in vibe to Bates or Bowdoin. Quite outdoorsy, good environmental science program. Yes, both are pretty isolated, but I always think your best bet is to look at the freshman retention rate. Kids are happy, despite the isolation.<br>There is a lot of overlap in kids applying to these colleges. You aren\u2019t going to go wrong with any of them. Get a Fiske guide and look at the website Niche to get better ideas of these colleges.<br><br>", "<b>Username: homerdog</b><br><br>For what\u2019s it\u2019s worth, I know two students at Midd.

Good questions for the math department too.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>As a general comment, I\u2019m in favor of interdisciplinary concentrations when the requisites are present in the general curriculum. For example, a student, under guidance, could create a major or minor in data science through, if available, appropriate courses in computer science, math and statistics. For this reason, I think @ncelotto should seek colleges that offer strong academic programs across several core areas, particularly those just mentioned. Along these lines, pursuing a data science major/minor specifically may counterproductively limit his choices. For a branch of mathematics such as statistics, however, the courses essential to a major or minor would either be present in sufficient quantity and depth or not, excepting in the case of independent study.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lookingforward</b><br><br>I wouldnt call Bates rural or dry.<br>The issue is where you can satisfy your running interests while preparing for the future you want, including your other personal interests (city kid vs smaller urban area.)<br>I don\u2019t know why discussions of Bates so often turn into pitches for Bowdoin and a few certain others.

Northeastern student here (3rd year, also work for admissions)\u2026even though I\u2019m late to the conversation. Not sure if NU is still top on your list but if you\u2019re interested in CS/data science or BNS, NU is extremely strong in those programs. NU had the first college ever in the nation dedicated to computer science, and recently received a $50 million endowment to the computer science college. My boyfriend studies computer science with a concentration in AI, and he loves the program here. The professors are top notch and the co-ops within CS are AMAZING. Also, I think its worth noting that wile CS classes at NU might be higher than at Bates, the average class size at NU is only 24, so you still really get to know your professors and other students. There is also a CS Living Learning Community if you\u2019re interested in living with other people within your major. Like I mentioned, the co-ops for CS students are absolutely incredible (not to mention they pay up to $40/hr). I have a friend who is CS and his second co-op is at NASA out in California where he\u2019s working with data that\u2019s coming back from the Mars Rover. There are great opportunities to work with companies that are well established (Google, Amazon, NASA, etc.) or smaller, start-up companies.<br>Obviously there\u2019s more to consider when choosing schools than JUST academics, but realistically you\u2019re there to get an education. In terms of how big the schools feels, it honestly feels like the PERFECT size. Technically there are around 18,000 undergrads, but I promise you it does NOT feel that big. With students coming and going for study abroad, co-op, etc, not all of those 18,000 are ever on campus at the same time. Especially when you join clubs and make friends in your classes and dorm, the university will not feel that big. While walking to class I always see people I know!<br>Hope this helps at all, feel free to reach out with any more questions!<br><br>", "<b>Username: ncelotto</b><br><br>@bremcclarey thank you so much!
