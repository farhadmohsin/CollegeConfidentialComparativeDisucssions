Also, it has exceptional career services.  (And there are often a couple of research opportunities in economics over the summer.  Competitive to get.)

Freshman get doubles and triples. The latter are not \u201cforced\u201d, in that they have always been triples, but they are not necessarily terribly big.  With that said, if you choose a substance free dorm, I think it is likely that it will have only doubles.

He speaks very highly of the head of the CS department as well as the other CS profs whose classes he has taken.  Seems to be a quickly growing program at Colby.  Similar experience for Econ.  It is a popular major, so sometimes it is difficult to get into a class, but he seems to figure it out each term.  Overall he really loves Colby.  He is not a party kid and has found great friends who are similar.  He was in a triple freshman year, but not many kids are placed in triples.  His room was huge, so although he was concerned at first, it was not an issue at all for him.  He has a very close friend at Bates who is very happy there, however I am not familiar with their CS or Econ programs.  I will say that Bates and Skidmore tend to have the reputation of being more artsy while Colby is more outdoorsy if that matters to you at all.

In fact, at Skidmore, we couldn\u2019t find community activation, which was a deciding point for D1. Yes, we asked.  Apparently there is high need in Saratoga, somewhat hidden to visitors.

First, each college gives instructions and it generally should be someone who oversaw the high school years, there\u2019s an intent to the LoR, it\u2019s not just commentary (nice kid, works hard.)  And 2nd, for homeschool, it\u2019s often tough to meet their expectations when you describe isolation and main focus on academics.  How will OP show engagement, in ways these colleges want to see?
