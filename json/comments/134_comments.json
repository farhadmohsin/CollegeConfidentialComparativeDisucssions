Which college will end up with better job opportunities?  What about in terms of social experiences?  Is BC fun?  What do kids do on the weekends? Do most BC kids go to boston on weekends?  Is NU hard to keep same friends with Coops and kids coming and going?  I can\u2019t make up my mind.  I want to meet and keep lifelong friends and I want to get a great job as well!<br><br>", "<b>Username: bluebayou</b><br><br>yes, in terms of prestige, jobs, etc, BC and NEU are similar.   Is there a difference in Cost of Attendance?  (On another thread, you posted about merit from NEU.)  What major?<br>Different campus cultures, and NE is more urban, while BC is a leafy, suburban campus (even tho technically speaking, half of the main campus resides inside the Boston City limits).  Jesuit education is a big differentiator and the Core curriculum vs. the coop program at NE.  Fortunately, the Boston environs has a ton of businesses, so internships are plentiful for those that attend BC.  Given the low unemployment rate right now, as a parent I think the coop program is over sold.  (now, back in the last recession\u2026)<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>In New England, BC is considered to attract the higher performing students. And those with less of a specific career goal in mind. But that doesn\u2019t mean anything in the real world. Both are great and the best students at each school have unlimited opportunities for success in life. You can\u2019t go wrong.<br>Yes BC is fun. But it\u2019s very rigorous.  NEU isn\u2019t the same type of environment. Doesn\u2019t have the big sports options on campus etc. but college kids all know how to have fun.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CCSavant</b><br><br>These schools could not be more different. First off, don\u2019t be influenced by Northeastern\u2019s lower admit rate. Northeastern has worked very hard over the years to generate the high application numbers needed to report such a rate. My son got endless expensive mailings and, ultimately, was offered an application fee waiver (not for financial reasons). At that time, there was no writing supplement. Now there is a modest one. My experience based on my son\u2019s high school is that BC was a more difficult school to gain admittance to. And application numbers at BC are limited by BC\u2019s Catholic heritage. Having said that, the stats of the enrolled students at Northeastern (to the extent that they are reliable - may exclude international students and all of those NU-in students who don\u2019t show up as Fall Freshmen) are impressive.<br>As to the differences, Northeastern is very urban, less sports oriented and with the college experience highly driven by coops rather than the campus. I think you lose the sense of \u201cclass\u201d early on, as you and your fellow students rotate in and out of school regularly. That is not necessarily bad, as it does provide perhaps for meeting many new people along the way, but it is different. It is also five years at Northeastern - usually.<br>BC is strongly influenced by its Jesuit heritage, sports culture, and strong campus community. The campus is not urban, but certainly within easy striking distance of downtown Boston on any given day through public transportation. Heck, you could walk it. To me, that is the best of both worlds, though for some, being able to walk across the street to art museum or hang out at urban cafes, etc. might be very attractive. BC is certainly in a safer neighborhood.<br>I know great students at each school, and they like where they are at. So\u2026two good choices, but very different ones.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BCBoundMaybe</b><br><br>I\u2019d pick based on which campus you like and which is best fit for your major.  They both are great schools, just different.  I applied to both and got denied from NU and accepted to BC.  My friend applied to both and he got into NU and denied from BC.  So no idea which is harder or more prestigious.  I\u2019d just go based on how you feel after visiting.  That will tell you a lot.  Good luck.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bbfan1927</b><br><br>@kdmit1998- Well, I am biased for sure, but BC over NEU all the time.  BC has a BRAND and an identity- one of those intangibles that are earned over a very long period of time.  IMHO, go to NEU if you truly desire a urban college experience.  If you want a college campus environment that fosters relationships and a collegiate experience, enjoy a sports atmosphere, seek a active, supportive and very vocal alumni, and a solid academic reputation, than BC is the school. NEU is a fine school, but they play games with their admit ratio, so don\u2019t be lured by that. Many students at BC are here because they didn\u2019t get into the Ivies, ND or GT. the NEU. We have a solid academically inclined and determined student body, and the work assigned is vigorous- so dont kid yourself that getting an A is an easy feat- its not. You have to work hard here.

They are not the same thing.  Many of these coops are arranged through long standing relationships with companies.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PengsPhils</b><br><br>To give a differing perspective and correct some information:<br>Co-op is absolutely a huge difference between internship programs. Northeastern doesn\u2019t have a top-rated career center (top 3 in Princeton Review for the past decade) without reason. Having a huge database of longstanding co-op relationships and specific co-op advisor and co-op prep classes in addition to the career center resources helps students be ready for postgrad life. The time difference also allows for more meaningful work. The environment also encourages much more experience. A student with two internships has only a third of the work experience that a student with 3 co-ops has when they graduate.<br>You don\u2019t need co-op by any means to be successful, but there is absolutely an advantage. No, it\u2019s not just marketing. The question for a prospective student should be how those advantages compare with other factors in their decision and how they feel about the differences in the academic model that co-op creates. If you really want that consistent campus life then going to BC and doing internships is probably the better call. It\u2019s just a matter of values.<br>I think it is very telling that the list provided by @CCSavant is exactly the reason I looked at both schools, never even bothered applying to BC, and chose Northeastern in the end. The co-op program, urban environment, and strength in programs over BC (CS in my case) are three great reasons to pick Northeastern for some, but for others they aren\u2019t important. What\u2019s really emphasized by that list is that fit is what should guide your choice here.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tR5674</b><br><br>I actually have twin HS Seniors that seem to be trending towards 1 going to NEU and 1 going to BC.  Each accepted to both schools among others.  BC grad myself.<br>@CCSavant  The Coop program is for real.  There are decades of relationships with employers who have taken kids for Coop/ 6-month paid employment stints with that number continuing to grow and more and more are not in New England/Boston.  It seems that most NEU grads have at least two 6-month stints of working and getting paid.  While you are working in these stints, the student can continue to live in university housing / even continue to use some form of the meal plan if they want.  They don\u2019t pay tuition while working and make anywhere from $20 to $40 per hour in their work.  Kids graduate with real hands-on experience that enhances a resume more than an internship IMO.  At a recent Admitted Student Day, we were told that over 100 Coop jobs didn\u2019t get filled - so there are plenty of Coop jobs which allows kids to try out different roles/ professions.<br>Hey, I\u2019m a big BC fan.  I am also a big NEU fan.  The Coop program is definitely pre-professional as opposed to liberal arts focused; as are the BC Schools of Management, Nursing, and Education.  Coop program isn\u2019t for everyone but it is pretty darn impressive.<br><br>", "<b>Username: TomSrOfBoston</b><br><br>I will cite one example of the difference between a coop and an internship. I read this on another blog that CC does not allow to be linked.  A Northeastern student was an accounting major.  He did his first coop at a Big 4 accounting firm in the January to June cycle, as most accounting coops are.  The wage was good and he worked 70-80 hour weeks from January through April.  He made a lot of money with overtime. It slowed in May and June was very relaxed.  In June the summer interns arrived.  The firm sponsored company trips to baseball games and amusement parks during the work week.  The interns thought \u201cWow!\u201d  this is a fun and easy job.  They had no idea about the grind of tax season and stories about it didn\u2019t phase them.  They never worked through it.<br>That student changed his major to finance upon returning to campus in July.  He learned that big accounting was not for him.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bluebayou</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>That student changed his major to finance upon returning to campus in July.<br>\"\"<br><br>Did said student still graduate in four years?   I see NEU still does not report its four-year graduation rate\u2026<br>Back when NEU did publish its stats, the 4-year grad rate was &lt;20%.  (Staggering number, IMO.)  Assuming the number has improved to say, 50%, that\u2019s still a big factor for parents to consider:  1) additional costs; 2) co-op experience is now offset by a job working in the real world if graduating \u2018on time\u2019.<br>https://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/at-northeastern-a-degree-in-4-years-instead-of-5/<br>For perspective, at BC, 4-year grad rate is ~90%.<br><br>", "<b>Username: TomSrOfBoston</b><br><br>@bluebayou<br><br>\"\"<br>Did said student still graduate in four years?<br>\"\"<br><br>He is still a student.  He should be able to graduate in 4 years, If he chooses to do so.<br>All but a handful (pharmacy, architecture) of programs at Northeastern can now be completed in four year, if the student so chooses.  I would imagine that the four year graduation rate is still under 25%.  There are no additional costs of attendance because tuition is not charged while on coop and virtually all coop jobs are paid.<br>Why do you consider the 4 year graduation rate to be \u201cstaggering\u201d since in the past Northeastern had always been a 5 year program and made that quite clear in its promotions?<br><br>", "<b>Username: elderwood</b><br><br>@bluebayou quoting statistics that are a misrepresentation of the program is not helpful to a student trying to decide. Even if you go to NEU for 5 years you do not pay more. You go to school for 8 semesters and pay for 8 semesters like every other college.  There might be exceptions to paying more if students want to go on multiple international dialogues, do additional summer sessions, combine with masters program, etc. You work in the real world, earning real wages for 2 or 3 coop semesters and don\u2019t pay tuition.  No one is stopping kids from graduating in 4 years , 2 coops.  Many kids want that third coop and do not see a downside to 5 years. In fact many excellent job offers come out of the last coop.  Still, they only pay for 4 years of school\u2026not sure how often this fact needs to be repeated.<br>On another note @kdmt1998 don\u2019t rely on biased opinions to make such an important decision. These 2 schools are as different as can be.  You have to feel completely comfortable with the culture (and perceived prestige differences, if that is as important to you as it seems). One of my children chose NEU over BC and schools more \u201cprestigious\u201d than BC. It was more difficult for us parents to get over that fact, but it is NOT our college experience. He wanted to be in an environment that didn\u2019t feel like an extension of HS and being able to explore the world through NEU programs was way more important than a traditional college experience.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>It\u2019s like a beanpot thread. lol.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ProfessorPlum168</b><br><br>FWIW, my D will graduate at NEU in 3.5 years, this December.

And she loves it there at NEU.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tR5674</b><br><br>@bluebayou  If you show up with a bunch of APs, you can graduate in 4 years from NEU even with two 6 month work stints.  Many kids stay the extra half year or full year to get a 3rd 6 month job or to study abroad.  It is an entirely different model than BC.  Again, I\u2019m a BC grad and fan but the 4 year graduation rate isn\u2019t a good way to measure the effectiveness of the very different models.  The Coop program is actually intended to be in general a greater than 4 year program.  Student only pays for 3 or 4 years because of Coops.  An traditional internship (7-8 weeks in summer?) is nice but limited.  Compared to multiple 6 months Coops?  Unquestionably NEU kids come out with real work experience and real resumes.

Enjoy life, go experience things!<br>For the original poster - BC and NU and both great schools and I do not think you can make a wrong decision. I attended NU a decade ago now, so consider me as a source somewhat biased (I also attended Harvard for grad school). The campuses are different aesthetics (although that wouldn\u2019t be the top reasons I would choose a school). Northeastern is ranked #44 in US News and BC is ranked #38, which isnt a significant different (NU has higher SAT/ACT scores). Northeastern is BC\u2019s 2nd most common cross-admit so there are a lot of students choosing between these two schools. I can\u2019t speak to the social scene at BC, but I can tell you that although you might not see certain friends for 6 months while on co-op, or a dialogue, or study abroad - the sheer number of friends and connections youll make by exploring means that youll have friends around the country (and world). In my experience, I did not feel like I lost anything from choosing NU over a more traditional college experience. @kdmt1998<br><br>", "<b>Username: kdmt1998</b><br><br>Hi Everyone,  I am the original OP, poster.  I thought I should come back and report on the decision.  My daughter chose Northeastern.  It was a tough choice!  My brother went to BC, my dad went to BU.  She chose Northeastern for a few reasons. She is a STEM major and felt the STEM program at NU was stronger.  She is very interested in global and felt the global program at NU was stronger and finally she was sold on the COOP.  She is not 100% positive what she wants to do and  felt the COOP could help her decide rather than spend four years not really sure.  Finally, She got almost $100K in merit aid from NU and nothing from BC.  We could not justify the cost difference as we have two younger ones. And finally, she came from a small high school that was very clicky and was worried it would be a repeat at BC.  Of course, we have no idea but that was what she went with.

She also worked two jobs from 9th grade on, one in the after school program for elementary school. I think her common app essay was sincere and she had good teacher recs I think.
