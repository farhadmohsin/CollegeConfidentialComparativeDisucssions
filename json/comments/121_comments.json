In fact, I would say the opposite: Sheer intellectual brilliance is probably a hindrance to becoming a high-rolling donor and there are rankings that tend to support this. Of the three LACs that habitually occupy the top three spots on the USNews poll, Swarthmore (#3), is probably the best known for its hot house intellectual atmosphere. But, according to collegescorecard, its alumni barely earn more than Wesleyan (currently #17 in the poll) grads six after graduation. Why?

He is a natural leader.  He talks with ease with adults and has since he was in middle school, now in Sophomore or Junior year in HS.  He is an amazingly talented writer.  He has done so many things in leadership in his school and community.  He is in an elite school (at least for our area) and top classes and getting As.  He is very academically capable.

It\u2019s crazy to use a single score solely to judge the intellectual ability or potential of a particular student, because of idiosyncratic factors.

I need to think a little more on this.  Intuitively, I feel like the intellectual firepower of a school vis a vis any other is determined by no more than a small fraction of its students, maybe 20% at most.  Maybe I have internalized too much Pareto <br><br>", "<b>Username: suteiki77</b><br><br>All of those are excellent schools where someone would get a great education.  It is so very competitive to get a job as a professor at any school, even schools who admit most all students, that I think it is very wrong to think one school has \u2018better\u2019 teachers than another because it is rated higher on whatever rating scale.  Also, many schools now are test optional, another flaw with the idea that you can tell how intelligent by the average SAT scores when many are not reporting their scores and in some cases that could bring down those averages quite a bit if all were counted.<br>A student would be fortunate to get into any of these schools.  All of them have very good rates for grad school placement.

The best professors I ever had were there!!  This idea that higher ranked = better isn\u2019t an exact thing.  In many cases it\u2019s flat out wrong, I believe.<br>higher rank is often tied to the size of the endowment.  Endowment size can be tied to having one or a small number of very wealthy alumni rather than an overall high earning power of all grads.  It can give a false impression of the results of a degree from said college.<br>I know so many people with great careers who went to so called \u2018no name\u2019 schools.  I know people who went to top schools who don\u2019t make a lot of money, and all sorts of people in between.  A top school can help get interviews and in some fields, it does seem to matter.  Some schools are feeders for certain grad schools, careers (finance, etc).  But all the schools you mentioned would help grads get interviews at least in areas where people have heard of those schools, and all should give a great education.

However, I wish our country would make funding for schools and resources and other aspects of education much more equal than they are now.  People who site the lower test scores of certain groups do not seem to be very interested in change so that all Americans can get an excellent education, no matter if they are wealthy or poor or in between.  Having high class sizes, small budgets, insufficient materials, etc, and then judging those schools as \u2018failing\u2019 and those students as less than is wrong.  And those students are not less intelligent. Given the same advantages of students in wealthier districts, they would achieve as much.  When I taught high school I often got the students no one wanted, the ones in the lowest level classes along with one middle level class.  I would often find those middle level (college prep class) students looked down on the students in the general education classes.  They were sometimes pretty snotty about it, too.  I remember lecturing the class after they called those kids, \u201cscummy\u201d because, truly, the main big difference between those kids in the college prep classes and those in general ed classes was money and family situation.  Those kids had more money, had parents that were more involved, bought them nicer clothing.  Often times they were not any brighter and quite a lot really in my opinion had lower IQs those a bunch in the general ed classes.  Those kids in the general ed classes often had a lot of family stuff that was weighing them down and also didn\u2019t feel that school and trying hard had meaning to their futures.  There were so many who I felt could have been in Honors classes if they tried, if they had different childhoods, if they had more money, less chaos at home, etc.  Not all, but a good number of them.  And there were almost no kids in the college level who I felt could have been in Honors and a good number who would have been in general level if not for their families.<br>Our education system doesn\u2019t treat students equally.  I personally think it is very wrong and immoral that people can buy a better education.  And I think it is short-sighted to waste the great potential of people who are not in school districts that get the deluxe treatment or average treatment others in America get.  Those people could all contribute more to society and achieve more and maybe discover the cure to cancer or Covid 19 or whatever if we allowed them to develop their abilities to the fullest.  That isn\u2019t to say that there are not great schools in poor districts but they are great in spite of lack of sufficient funding and resources often times.<br>Judging students on the end result of years in an unfair school system without looking at fixing the unfair school system itself is short-sighted.
