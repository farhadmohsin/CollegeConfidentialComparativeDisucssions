{"title": "grinnell vs bates", "comments": ["<b>Username: wyorafter</b><br><br>My daughter just got off the wait list at Bates after sending her deposit to Grinnell. Bates has given her a couple of days to commit/decide. Grinnell\u2019s admission includes about a 50% off tuition scholarship. I doubt Bates will offer anything, because, well, NESCAC. That aside, anybody want to weigh in on this choice? We\u2019re prepared to pay if it\u2019s really her choice. She won\u2019t thrive in an ultra-competitive environment. Wants to major in psychology. Runs XC though not a rock star. Loves outdoors, skiing,etc (I know Bates wins that one\u2026) From Rocky Mountain West.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Aspiringacademic</b><br><br>I personally think Grinnell is a better school. It\u2019s not uber-competitive, but it\u2019s known for its academic rigor, research opportunities afforded to undergraduates, and fantastic science programs. It also has a massive endowment which provides lots of opportunities for students; bates has, comparatively, always had a problem with raising a sufficient endowment. Given that Grinnell is offering her money, I think it\u2019s a no brainer. If she wants to do outdoorsy and skiing stuff, she can always take a year abroad in Switzerland! I think Grinnell is fairly good with study abroad stuff.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Midwestmomofboys</b><br><br>Agreed, Grinnell with money would be a \u201cno brainer\u201d in our house.

Skiing wouldn\u2019t be a day trip like Maine but Grinnell  isn\u2019t going to be confused with an urban environment anytime soon. Lol.<br>It\u2019s a great school and seems to produce a lot of successful and varied graduates.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Aug2019</b><br><br>If your D had gotten into both schools initially - did she have a clear favorite then? Just curious if her feelings have changed because if the circumstances of her acceptances to both.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>I love Bates and my daughter attends, but I would have sent her to Grinnell in a heartbeat for 50% off tuition. Grinnell is a great school.<br>OTOH, if you really don\u2019t mind paying the extra money, she won\u2019t regret choosing Bates. IMO, Bates is very hot right now (acceptance rate this year was just below 12%) and it\u2019s East Coast location makes it easy for students to find internships, research positions, and jobs. Your D has great choices, best of luck.<br>ETA: Bates is not competitive. Psych is excellent.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EganAg</b><br><br>Per student, Grinnell has more resources and expenditure than Bates. Faculty is extremely committed. Very well respected in the Midwest and a lot of kids end up with great internships and<br>jobs in the Chicago area.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>Bates wins on location but I\u2019d choose Grinnell given your family\u2019s circumstances. Bates doesn\u2019t give merit aid so unless you qualify for FA, you\u2019re not going to get a tuition break.<br>1/2 price Grinnell over Bates would be my choice. That tuition savings would buy a lot of ski trips. <br><br>", "<b>Username: Mom24boys</b><br><br>Another vote for Grinnell.  My son will be graduating this month from Grinnell with a double major in psychology and economics.  He was able to study abroad and do psych research.  He has been amditted to a fully funded PhD with a stipend.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Aug2019</b><br><br>Congratulations on that @mom24boys!<br><br>", "<b>Username: gardenstategal</b><br><br>I love all the Maine schools but here\u2019s another vote for Grinnell with your circumstances.   They are on a par with each other in pretty much every aspect  but one costs half as much?  No-brainer.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sue22</b><br><br>I love Bates but I agree with the others. Unless there\u2019s a very compelling reason to choose Bates the $100,000 she\u2019d save by going to Grinnell would make the decision in my book.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mamom</b><br><br>As @doschicos mentioned the money you save going to Grinnell can buy some very nice ski trips.  Both great choices but I would stick with Grinnell.<br><br>", "<b>Username: prodesse</b><br><br>Next year Grinnell will have an added bonus - being in Iowa, where all the major presidential candidates will be coming through!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>This is an easy, clear-cut decision based on OP\u2019s original post in this thread. There is nothing to indicate that Bates should be chosen. Grinnell College is the better choice. Why pay more for less ? (For example, Grinnell College is higher ranked than Bates & Grinnell College has a much larger endowment than Bates.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: homerdog</b><br><br>I love Grinnell and our son also received the 1/2 off tuition scholarship but has chosen to go to Bowdoin full-price. Has your D visited both schools? Grinnell is warm and inviting but S felt the kids leaned a little more nerdy (in a good way though!) than some of his other choices. I guess it depends on your financial situation and if your D really felt a connection when visiting each school. Grinnell seemed like it should have been the clear winner for us, $100k less over four years, the only school on his list within a 4 hour drive, and a really incredible school in so many ways. He just wasn\u2019t feeling it and, after  visiting Bowdoin, felt very strongly that he found his college home. He even arranged to stay an extra night on campus because he wanted to stay longer. If your D did not have a very strong preference for Bates, I would definitely stick with Grinnell.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>@homerdog: I think that there are some notable differences between Bates College & Bowdoin College. This seems to be reflected by the number of applications each of these schools receive even though both schools have about 1800 students.<br>Apps received for the same year: Bates College received 5,316 while Bowdoin College received 7,251 during the same application cycle\u2013over 36% more applications.<br>Bowdoin College has a superior location.<br>@homerdog: If the decision was between Bates College full pay & Grinnell College with a 50% scholarship, what would be your family\u2019s choice ?<br><br>", "<b>Username: homerdog</b><br><br>@Publisher We never visited Bates so I can\u2019t say for sure but my gut says Grinnell. He could have found his people for sure. If S19\u2019s revisit to Bowdoin didn\u2019t make it crystal clear that it was the place for him, Grinnell would have stayed in the running\u2026but my husband went on that trip with him and saw first hand how Bowdoin was a really great fit for S19. He accompanied him to both Grinnell and Bowdoin and so was able to compare. That\u2019s why I was asking the OP if his D has visited both schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Grinell. However the candidates coming through Iowa wouldn\u2019t be on my list for reasons to attend. lol.<br><br>", "<b>Username: homerdog</b><br><br>I know but my point was that visiting is what can make the call on whether to choose one school or another. And one of our schools in contention at the end was Grinnell. Bates and Grinnell are comparable academically so really the only way to make a decision is to be on campus and access the fit. I used our experience as an example.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EganAg</b><br><br>I think rankings, resources, endowment wise, Grinnell is better than Bates; just sheer numbers.  And then for half the price?<br>One other difference that we remember from our visit to Bates is that they work on a 4-4-1 schedule.  Does that matter to OP\u2019s D?  Unless there is something unique like that that is attractive, I think Grinnell wins here.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>I find the 4-4-1 schedule confusing.<br>Many colleges located in rural or semi-rural cold weather locations used to have a 4-1-4 academic schedule in which the month of January was a separate term during which students took just one course that met 5 days a week or was used for study abroad.<br>In the context of this thread, I view the 4-4-1 schedule as a negative for Bates College as May should be quite pleasant in Lewiston, Maine while January calls for some marine science study in the Florida Keys or a month in Colorado studying the physics involved in downhill skiing or learning to speak French to French girls in France or Montreal.<br>However, if the month of May was used to get a head start at an internship, working for course credit rather than for money, then that makes the 4-4-1 schedule look attractive.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>Many stay on campus for the 1/May and take interesting, fun classes. I think most Bates students would tell you they love the 4-4-1 schedule and definitely don\u2019t see it as a negative.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gardenstategal</b><br><br>@homerdog , Bates and Grinnell are much closer culturally than Grinnell and Bowdoin.<br><br>", "<b>Username: crankyoldman</b><br><br>That\u2019s a lot of money to walk away from-but let me ask-does your daughter want to run XC in college? Is that a factor in her decision-making?

But my mother keeps saying, \u201che wouldn\u2019t have been happy all the way out in Iowa\u201d  (She actually went to college near there and taught school for a year not too far from Grinnell, so it\u2019s not a dig at Iowa, just her opinion that my kid would not be happy in a rural location so far from home and family )<br>So, @wyorafter, if your daughter has no problem spending 4 years in the middle of Iowa, then go Grinnell.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Midwestmomofboys</b><br><br>Bates is a lovely school, but Grinnell has dramatically superior resources which contribute to all kinds of positives for student life, from the facilities, to funded internship programs, to guest speakers, performers etc. I haven\u2019t checked in the last year or so, but Grinnell\u2019s endowment is over $1.5  billion and Bates was around $300 million. Plus, Grinnell has a diverse student body and fantastic academics. In my house, I could not imagine paying more for Bates. Grinnell, Iowa is, to my mind at least (your mileage may vary) a charming midwest town 2-3 blocks from campus with all the necessaries for college life \u2013 pizza, bike shop, doughnut shop, great grocery store with extensive organic offerings. Both my kids loved Grinnell, we must have visited 6+ times between the two of them, and my LAC kid did visit Bates twice so we have some basis for comparison.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>You had me at \" pizza & doughnut shop\".<br><br>", "<b>Username: wyorafter</b><br><br>Funny, Bowdoin was her first choice. After being deferred in ED, she was rejected. She\u2019s also wait-listed at Carleton, Colby, Middlebury and Dartmouth, which, I cannot lie, is fogging up this decision. I would say of her five wait-lists, Bates was probably her fifth choice (among five very strong choices\u2026) But as of now, only Bates has come calling. She has visited all the campuses.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Midwestmomofboys</b><br><br>@publisher, apologies for my imprecise phrasing. Pizza shop, doughnut shop etc. . . . though a combination sounds too perfect.<br>Maybe I\u2019ve been living in the midwest too long, but Grinnell, the town, has charm  \u2013 2 story brick buildings, retail on the ground floor, often apartments on the second floor. There is an actual movie theater which plays new releases. There is a community band shell in the park where there are summer concerts (our first visit was in the summer). The grocery store \u2013 3 blocks from campus \u2013 is fabulous, lots of organic, all natural, and imported products (not that the students are picking up European treats). The few mile stretch from the interstate into town itself is disheartening \u2013 a large John Deere distributorship, a mid-range hotel, and a Walmart and not much else. But once you swing onto the actual town streets, it is quite lovely.<br><br>", "<b>Username: homerdog</b><br><br>@wyorafter wow. That\u2019s a lot of waitlists. Did she take spots at all of those? I think it\u2019s really hard to deal with a multiple waitlist situation. What if you accept Bates and then a school she likes even better gives her an offer? I would say, if Bates was near the bottom of her pecking order of waitlists, she should decline.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gardenstategal</b><br><br>@homerdog, the answer to the above is she\u2019ll forfeit another deposit.  It would be foolhardy to pass up one WL acceptance because another might come through.  Because it may not.<br>So right now, only Bates and Grinnell are on the table.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>I agree, forget the other waitlists. Right now, they are not options, and are not likely to be options. She should proceed as though they won\u2019t happen<br><br>", "<b>Username: Andrew2199</b><br><br>@wyorafter I have a son at Grinnell.  We also visited Bates.  Setting aside cost, I\u2019d pick Grinnell.  It\u2019s a great school.  Given the huge price difference, the choice seems especially clear.<br>The XC team at Grinnell (men\u2019s and women\u2019s) is very close, has a lot of fun and would provide an instant friend group. And a student doesn\u2019t need to be top flight to be on the team.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sue22</b><br><br>@wyorafter,<br>What does your daughter say?<br><br>", "<b>Username: wyorafter</b><br><br>So, GSGal, is your advice to take the Bates offer, pay the deposit, and wait until a later date to see if she comes off another waitlist, then forfeit whatever deposit(s) you need to when making a final decision?<br><br>", "<b>Username: menloparkmom</b><br><br>@wyorafter<br>^^ your DD  CAN\u2019T have deposits at 2 colleges at the same time.<br>It s the same as saying \u201cyes\u201d to 2 colleges, which is forbidden.<br>Your DD needs to EITHER accept the Bates offer now, which also means letting Grinnell she won\u2019t be coming, OR declining the Bates offer.<br>With college acceptances, you can\u2019t \u201chave your cake and eat it too\u201d.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Does she prefer Bates to Grinnell? Is the money not an issue? If so, she should deposit at Bates and immediately notify Grinnell that she is not enrolling.<br>FWIW, my D was in a similar position almost three years ago. She deposited at Bates, and immediately notified the other school that she wouldn\u2019t be attending. I then made her take the other college\u2019s bumper sticker off the car to seal the deal.<br><br>", "<b>Username: menloparkmom</b><br><br>^^ yes, but if $$ IS an issue, she should stick with Grinnell until she does hear from any other WL schools. She can always back out from Grinnell before the first semester tuition $$ is due.<br>She should also check the recent history of WL #'s at the other WL colleges from their Common Data Sets- see if they have a history of offering  thousands of students places on their WL, but end up accepting only a few. If that is the case, then the chances of her clearing the WL should be viewed as being very low.<br>One never knows how much \u201csummer melt\u201d will end up actually happening.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>@menloparkmom , I think the OP said her D is on the WL for a bunch of LACs and Dartmouth.<br>Historically, if those schools take kids from WL, it might be in the single digits. In some years, several of those colleges take 0, in others, maybe in the teens. It is impossible to look at previous years\u2019 data and try to determine if there is a chance of getting off WL. The overwhelming majority of students will not get off WL. Bates admitted 0 from the waitlist last year, but three years ago, they offered over 40. Carleton offered over 30 students a spot off WL last year, but three years ago, they offered 2.<br>If OP\u2019s daughter is hedging her bets on WL, she might be in for a long and anxious wait. Students who are pining for WL spots aren\u2019t as able to get excited about the college they plan to attend. I get the impression that Grinnell isn\u2019t the OP\u2019s top choice and she\u2019s hoping for something \u201cbetter\u201d, but I hope I\u2019m wrong.<br>ETA: @publisher, I literally do not know of a single person who views Bates short term as a negative. Not one, and I think by now I know a lot about Bates and I know a lot of Bates people. It is universally loved by everyone who is involved with Bates. It is a big selling point for Bates, as far as I am aware.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gardenstategal</b><br><br>@wyorafter , if Bates is the preferred option (over Grinnell), she should accept the place, pay the deposit,  then inform Grinnell that she will not attend.  She\u2019ll lose the Grinnell deposit (and that 50% discount on a great education. )<br>THEN she should evaluate whether she wants to stay on those other WL.  If so, do nothing.  If Bates seems like a better option than any of those, give up the WL spot.<br>Should she be offered a spot from any other WL that she prefers to Bates, she\u2019ll repeat the process,  this time rejecting Bates and forfeiting that deposit.  I would guess, but of course don\u2019t know, that none of those will come with $.<br>Realistically,  unless she doesn\u2019t really like Bates or has her heart set on one of those WL schools,  it gets harder to walk away from the school where you\u2019ve committed as time goes on.  Housing assignments,  \"meeting \" your advisor and starting to work through courses, meeting classmates at local events\u2026  all of this can make it feel more real and harder to leave.  Not that it doesn\u2019t happen but it\u2019s why WL schools tend to check in on continued interest periodically.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>OP, is there a decision yet?<br>Thought it might be useful for other readers to share this story about why it\u2019s a bad idea to double deposit. When my D was offered admission to Bates, it was from an AO who had JUST come from the college she had originally planned to attend. This AO was now working at her new college (we discovered this after the fact), and I have no idea if it was checked or not, but it would have taken just a phone call to determine if she had indeed withdrawn acceptance from the other school. (It seems pretty likely that the AO at Bates knew her name from the other college she originally planned to attend.) If she had double deposited at both schools, she would have had both offers rescinded. Scary thought!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>@Lindagaf : Re: your post #39 above: I only view the timing of short term as a potential negative as it could bring more joy if scheduled during January rather than in May. Due to poor weather in January & the chance to escape for a month to the Bahamas or elsewhere, short term could be a strong positive for attracting students, in my opinion & in my experience.<br>P.S. It might be interesting to take a poll of current Bates\u2019 students asking whether they would prefer the separate one month, one course term to occur in January or May.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Getting off track now, but\u2026<br>@Publisher , stated by my daughter most emphatically, just now: \u201cthe fun of short term is enjoying the outdoors. If it was in January, I wouldn\u2019t do it the third time. If I\u2019m going to be stuck on campus in January, I might as well be doing proper classes. Plus the weather in May is better for short term study abroad options.\u201d (Bates allows students to do short term three times if they like. Most seniors do it.)<br>That\u2019s straight from one current horse\u2019s mouth, anyway. ?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>That was my point = to enjoy the outdoors in a different location such as Colorado, Florida, The Bahamas, etc. I went to an LAC that had a J-Term similar to short term & to what Colby College had or has. The options were incredible both on &, especially, off campus.<br>P.S. One such offering was \u201cPeople Watching in Montreal\u201d offered as a psychology course.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Pros and cons to both. I don\u2019t know about Jan terms anywhere, I just know that Bates\u2019 short term is very popular. Regardless, I like the idea of either a Jan or May short term. Grinnell doesn\u2019t appear to offer a short term option.<br>Just saw that Dartmouth admitted zero from WL last year.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gardenstategal</b><br><br>Spring athletes love the May short term as it really allows them to focus on championships.  Skiers (including recreational) love the Jan short term in NE.  Travel study is popular for all of them.  Personally,  I would pick Jan over May.  But never having gone to a school with a short term, I would pick any short term over no short term!  It really lends itself to a different kind of study, even if it doesn\u2019t involve travel.<br><br>", "<b>Username: wyorafter</b><br><br>@Lindagaf , I never even suggested that she double-deposit.

You could also use the time to extend your winter break for travel, etc. As an alum, I can say I really liked this calendar a lot.

Bates comes in #4 in Fulbright scholarships, and Grinnell is #26. It depends on the list you look at, but Bates is ranked more highly in several (showing that rankings are not very meaningful, haha.)<br>Bates can never come close to Grinnell\u2019s endowment, or that of many other colleges. Historically, Bates graduated working class men, women, and African Americans, all people who were never (back in the day) going to earn a lot of money to donate to the school.

As of last count, Wesleyan has two alumni running for President, John Hickenlooper (read his autobiography, \u201cThe Opposite of Woe\u201d, where he devotes two chapters to Wesleyan and Middletown), and Michael Bennet, the senior Senator from Colorado.<br><br>\"\"<br>Totally agree with @LoveTheBard. If your D is interested in the sciences, Grinnell gets the nod as well.<br>\"\"<br><br>Not sure where this is coming from. Wesleyan is one of perhaps two traditional LACs that awards STEM degrees all the way to the doctoral level (the other is Bryn Mawr) This translates into millions of dollars in tax-supported research, the highest both nominally and per capita of any LAC in the country (okay, maybe that title toggles between Wesleyan and Wellesley from one year to the next). And, because all Wesleyan professors teach undergraduates, the demand for interns is constant and ongoing (i.e., not just during the summer.)<br>I would definitely add the Wesleyan W/L to the mix.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EganAg</b><br><br>@circuitrider my nod to Grinnell for Science is BECAUSE Weslyan has PhD programs.  I\u2019m a scientist and this is based on my look at the Physics, Chemistry, Biology depts where I have expertise and my D19 was very interested in at Weslyan.  We eliminated it after our investigation and a quick visit.  Yes, they have million dollars of grant funding, but, I got the feeling that the professors focus there is distracted with research and PhD students and not teaching undergrads.  Whereas places like Grinnell (full disclosure, a good friend of mine is a STEM professor there), Profs do research, but, it is more undergrad oriented as opposed to Weslyan or a research university like say, Chicago.  Whenever you have grad students around, we felt that the benefit of a LAC science environment is lost.

It is more advanced. That\u2019s the whole idea. Where I disagree with you is your assertion that somehow, because it is more advanced, that it is per se against the interests of undergrads. Just logically, it would seem advantageous to be taught by someone, under pretty much the same classroom dynamics as the best LACs in the country (i.e., Amherst, Grinnell, Bates, et al), but with a richer, more advanced resume.<br>Also, as a professional in the field, you must know the advantages for undergraduates of being able to intern in a laboratory all year round with the help of either grad students or a post-doc as opposed to only being able apply for summer research when their professors are no longer busy teaching.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EganAg</b><br><br>@circuitrider It is the feeling that we got when we visited and chatted with science professors at Weslyan, Amherst, Midd, Bowdoin, Bates, Mac on our visits.

Either way, it might behoove them to consider taking a spot on the Wesleyan W/L.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EganAg</b><br><br>At the risk of angering Bates supporters on the thread- We felt that the Middletown and nearby Hartford are much nicer cities and thriving cities than Lewiston, ME.

But, had dinner at a wonderful vegan place called Guthries.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>@EganAg , not angry. Lewiston has a lot of nice places now, and there are a lot of good restaurants. There is a lovely, long river walk that crosses the river to an outdoor theater venue and has nice views. There\u2019s a bird sanctuary adjacent to campus where people run and walk. But I don\u2019t think Bates people care that Lewiston isn\u2019t beautiful.

The reason this was such a tough decision for my daughter is that her 1st choice was Bowdoin, because of it\u2019s blend of strong academics, outdoor culture and inclusive (somewhat?) less competitive culture. After applying there ED and being deferred, she set her sights on schools she thought to be similar (Colby, Middlebury and Bates) as reaches, along with Dartmouth, Carleton, Connecticut College, Wesleyan and Brown. More \u201creachable\u201d (match?) applications were placed at Oberlin (her sister is there), St. Olaf, Macalaster, St. Lawrence, and Whitman. All along she continued to pine for Bowdoin.When regular decisions came in, it was:  Accepted at Oberlin, St. Olaf, Macalaster, St. Lawrence, Whitman and Grinnell. SEVEN waitlists: Dartmouth, Colby, Middlebury, Bates, Wesleyan, Carleton and Connecticut College. Denied admission by Bowdoin and Brown. She stayed on all the waitlists, paid her deposit and chose Grinnell, and figured the waitlists would fade away. You know the rest (so far). In the end, she decided that she was reflecting her love of Bowdoin onto Bates (a very fine school) but that there wasn\u2019t any of the passion for it that she had for Bowdoin. Her visit to Grinnell was a good one. Wesleyan awaits her decision.<br>I made a round of calls today to the admissions offices at Dartmouth, Middlebury, Carleton and Colby. Middlebury is in the middle of working through their waitlist (evidence of that exists elsewhere on this forum) Dartmouth, Middlebury and Colby sound doubtful. We are aware of the gift that is these waitlist acceptances to Bates and Colby.
