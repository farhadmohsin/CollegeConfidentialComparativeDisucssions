Students can take almost unlimited classes as satisfactory/no credit . The deadline to drop a class is at the last day of classes. Also with no distribution requirements, students are largely taking classes they are excited to be in, rather than to fulfill requirements.<br><br>Brown only gives grades of A, B and C with no A- or B+, etc. so if a student doesnt get a 4.0 in the class, the next possible grade is a 3.0. So some students who are not getting As and in some cases, even Bs, will drop a class at the end of the semester rather than taking a grade that will substantially lower their GPA. Brown also does not give Ds and Fs. Any grade lower than a C and it's as if the class never existed on your transcript.<br><br>The A-B-C grade system also sometimes result in the cutoff for an A being a little more generous than at a school where the next lowest grade is a 3.7 rather than a 3.0. but, there is a degree of grade deflation as well when the student with a 3.6-3.7 average in the class gets a B/3.0 as a final grade.<br><br>GPA inflation is not the same thing as grade inflation in individual classes. The quality and quantity of work that is required to get an A in a class at Brown is not at some lower level than its peer schools. Like many peer schools, most classes at Brown don't have a bell curve distribution for assigning grades, so if 60% of the students do A level work then 60% of the students will get As.

GPA inflation IS grade inflation (in fact, studies of grade inflation often use GPA distributions to measure grade inflation, or percentage of As - both of which is high at Brown).<br><br>Brown and Duke have the same quality of student - yet Duke students have a harder time getting As and higher GPAs.<br><br>The OP ought to be aware of this to make an educated decision.

Are there courses or programs that seem more appealing at one versus the other? Brown offers an Open Curriculum, which gives students a lot of choice, but is that something that your son would take advantage of? On the other hand, Duke has more traditional General Education requirements, and maybe those classes seem more in line with your son's preferences.

I find it interesting that you mentioned startups. One of the most important players in the startup world are VC/PE (Venture Capital/Private Equity) firms and Investment Banks (who handle M&amp;A, IPOs, underwriting, etc.). These firms care a lot about GPA for the limited undergrad recruitment they do. Financing (both buy-side and sell-side) play a huge role in the startup world and the OP's son may be interesting in pursuing that as someone studying Econ.
