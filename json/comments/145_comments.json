If I went to Brown, I would pay for the other half of the degree by doing work-studies and working through the summers.

Invest the $160k in an index fund like the S&P 500.  2nd year, have your parents co-sign with you on a mortgage loan to purchase a real estate property near your campus (Amherst median price $340k approx).  Use part of your cash for a down payment approx $68k.  You would live there rent free (parents pay your portion) and rent out the rest of the rooms to college students.  Occupy the same property until graduation.  Hopefully you have positive cash flow starting in the 1st year.  Continue to invest the remaining funds in an index fund or funds (diversify).<br>Upon graduation, find a full job/employer who will pay for your MBA or graduate school and go to school part time while working.<br>If everything goes as planned (no guarantees), you will have no student loan debt plus liquid & real estate investments generating cash flow.  Max out your 401(k) at work.<br>Your investments with compounding interest will generate long-term wealth.

We told him that we would support him financially at either place.<br>Seems some here would say without a second thought- go to UCLA!  Not my son.  We are on the East Coast.  UCLA was not even on his list of schools until I suggested UCLA when we were visiting Cal Tech.  He liked the campus and since he was applying to Berkeley, he figured why not.  So why Rutgers?  First, his parents are both proud Rutgers alums.  Second, while it is not his money, he said that he did not think the additional money for UCLA (Over $225K for 4 years) would be money well spent.  Third, and most important, he dug in and took a close look at the coursework and curriculum of both programs, and  he concluded that Rutgers would be a better fit for him. Fourth, we have heard nothing but rave reviews from students who attended Rutgers Honors College.<br>I still feel toxic elitism bubbling to the surface in my mind and wanting him to go to the \u201cbest school\u201d that accepted him, and that is certainly UCLA by any objective measure.
