I ultimately chose Penn because i felt the engineering and business offerings were superior and also because Penn was still strong overall and I felt I would have a well-rounded education. And i did. The Penn curriculum is very flexible and you can take courses in all undergraduate and graduate schools at Penn and there is still room to take electives. Also it is strong across the board so I don't think you would be getting a more well-rounded education at Yale. That said the academic focus at Yale is different. More theoretical. In terms of grade inflation, Yale a more grade-inflated.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sheilsarda</b><br><br>@Penn95 What do you think about Yale being more undergraduate-focused in their STEM departments, given that it's much smaller than that of Penn.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>@sheilsarda Personally i feel undergrad focus is a rather vague term. Penn engineering has about 435 students per class while Yale has 108. Still you will have access to professors, TAs at both. I never felt i didn't have access to my professors at Penn and all classes are taught by professors who also hold regular office hours. The fact that there are more students interested in STEM meant more STEM- oriented student organizations and more like-minded people to learn from. Penn engineering is still at a very manageable size (435 per class is not a lot) but also quite diverse because of its size.

Biomedical engineering at Yale it is a small program, but builds on its world leading Biology, Medicine and Chemistry departments, which are all top 10-12 in the world, and the research by faculty is cutting edge. (Check out Mark Saltzmann and Andre Levchenko's research, as well the the Yale West Campus among other things). I presume Biomedical Engineering at Penn isn't an option for you, but the curriculum requirements are broadly similar anyway.<br><br>If you're interested in entrepreneurship, Wharton definitely has a much larger group of people with like minded interests, but Yale also sees its fair share of startups. The Yale Entrepreneurial Institute gives out tons of money each year and there are lots of companies that start off as collaborations between undergraduates, medical school, law school and business school students.<br><br>If you want to be the best engineer, I would suggest Yale even though Penn might have a larger engineering program, because the Jerome Fisher program has a huge number of requirements that are economics/finance based. At Yale you could devote that time to engineering/math/science courses instead if you wish.<br><br>The campus culture at both schools is mostly defined by the mix of majors. At Yale more students tend to be involved in the arts and government as well as public service. At Penn, you'll find more students interested in finance, business, etc. There will be lots of science geeks at both places at well.

They tend to foster a great sense of community, and make the university more accessible. Freshmen are generally undeclared, and the majority of them are not physically housed in the residential college itself (depending on the college), so you would almost certainly be with \"random roommates we'll probably not be in my major\".

The idea is that living with a variety of people studying various things, in a smaller community (the residential college, which you're affiliated with whether or not you live in it as a freshman), is part of your education.

Stanford now takes 42% of cross-admits with Harvard (up from 35% in years past), and takes the big majority from everywhere else. Dean Shaw even says that, outside of HYMP, no school takes more than \"single digit percentages\" from Stanford. With Penn at #11 in Stanford's top competitor pool, and not taking more than 9.9% of cross-admits (in past years, Shaw actually posted the data - and Penn took 2%, but recently he's stopped even bothering posting data from non-HYMP schools), it means maybe only 5-15 students at Penn turn down Stanford a year.<br><br><br>BRINGING THIS BACK around to the discussion about Yale - it's important to remember the numbers here. As Yale has about a 70% yield rate, and its admissions system resembles Stanford, it stands to reason that it loses the biggest chunk (60-70%) of its cross-admit pool to HMPS. So, for the 600 students who don't choose Yale, HMPS probably gets about 400 of them.

Here's my *very* rough description of what I think is going on, using made-up (but I believe plausible) numbers - please correct me if you disagree.<br><br>The population that applies to HYPSM each year consists of, I'm going to guess, something around 125,000 unique applicants, competing for something over 9,000 total offers of admission, with total freshman enrollment at the five schools of something over 7,000 (i.e., there are about 2,000 cross-admits across the five schools). I'll guess that half of the applicants are unqualified and are denied on first reading. Then let's say that across the five schools 850 of the slots go to recruited athletes and a similar number go to legacies. I'll assume that one in five of these gets one cross-admit to another school in the group (bearing in mind that although the athletes are talented, they're mostly recruited early and often don't apply to more than one of HYPMS, and although the legacies may be high-quality, the hook only works in one place). I'll assume 2,400 other HYPSM legacies are denied at their legacy school as well as all the other four. So now we're at 58,400 remaining applicants for 7,960 remaining offers.<br><br>Bear with me at this point - I'm going to allude to race, but I believe my points are noncontroversial, and I apologize if I inadvertently offend anyone. I'm not aiming to provoke a discussion about race in college admissions, or to opine about what colleges should be doing in this area, so I hope no one will go there.<br><br>I estimate there are about 1,200 URM matriculants among HYPSM in each year. The population of URMs that test in the top 1% of their racial group is, I estimate, a few thousand. I believe a large number of these academically elite URMs who apply to any of HYPSM will get an offer, and that they are very likely to be cross-admitted. Let's say 600 of the academically tippy-top URMs apply to at least one of HYPSM and get 1.5 offers each on average. The remainder of the admitted URMs overlap with other groups described herein. This takes us to something like 57,800 remaining applicants for 7,060 remaining offers.<br><br>Now to the ORMs. Of the ~125,000 unique applicants to HYPSM, I'm going to assume that 21,500 are either Asian-American or international (principally Asian), since that number is roughly equivalent to the top 10% of Asian-American high school seniors (somewhat less than that number will apply, and I'm assuming it gets made up by internationals). Let's say roughly 1,500 will ultimately matriculate across HYPSM, and that they'll get 1.25 HYPSM offers each on average (i.e., one in four gets two offers, the rest get one). The other 19,000 are denied. That brings us down to 37,300 applicants for 5,185 remaining offers.<br><br>Let's say each school has 50 (for a total of 250) miscellaneous other \"institutional priorities\" on average (development case, celebrity or celebrity offspring, from the 50th state, faculty brat, child of a foreign government official, very strong in some sport that doesn't get a recruit spot, contrabassoon virtuoso, Broadway performer, published author or other unique talent, etc.) and they get 1.5 offers each on average - now we're at 37,050 applicants for 4,810 remaining offers.<br><br>Assume 300 unquestionable geniuses, who get 2 HYPSM offers each on average - we're now down to 36,750 applicants for 4,210 remaining offers.<br><br>I'm going to guess most of the desired number of first-gens at each school has been reached via overlap with the athletes, URMs and other institutional priorities groups, but let's assume another 500 across the five schools are admitted (e.g., through QuestBridge) and get 1.2 admits each on average. Now we're at 36,250 applicants for 3,610 remaining offers<br><br>At this point, we get to everyone else and individual results become much less predictable - did the rest of your package, i.e., your essays, recommendations, etc., speak to the adcoms in the right way? Did you convince them that you and the school are a perfect match? Some of the best unhooked or weaker-hooked kids may have lightning strike in more than one place, because they have an unusual story. I think 2,600 students or so divide those 3,610 remaining offers; the other 33,650 are denied.<br><br>So, let's check the math: 125,000 applicants, less 62,500 denied for being unqualified, less 2,400 denied legacies, less 19,000 denied ORMs/internationals, less 33,650 others denied equals 7,450 HYPSM matriculants - pretty close to the aggregate number of 7,217 posited by @spayurpets in last year's compilation of admissions data.<br><br>The numbers also add up to 2,060 cross-admits among the HYPSM schools. Since there are 10 possible two-school cross-admit pairs, this means that there are just over 200 cross-admitted students on average for each two-school pair, which seems in line with the Stanford faculty senate numbers. Bear in mind that each school hands out about 2,000 admits, so the cross-admit percentage is roughly 10% with any other school.<br><br>Yes, I know this is a gross oversimplification and people will have differing opinions as to the size and composition of the groups, but I don't think it's a million miles from the truth. One can see how these schools could have processes that are more similar than different, but that the aggregate number of cross-admits could still be pretty small. This is, in my opinion, because large percentages of cross-admits tend to be found in groups that have small numbers (e.g., elite URMs, institutional priorities and unquestionable geniuses, all of whom are rare and highly-prized), while for the larger groups (e.g., ORMs/internationals and the unhooked), chances are that different (albeit possibly overlapping) subsets will be admitted at each of HYPSM because the large numbers make individual admits less predictable.<br><br>", "<b>Username: DeepBlue86</b><br><br>As a follow-up, I should have clarified two things.<br><br>First, it should be clear that I worked backwards from known numbers of matriculated students (e.g., athletes, legacies, Asians) to figure out how HYPSM ended up with those numbers. What I'm *not* saying is that these schools decide, for example, how many Asians they want, make a list of Asian applicants and then pick out names until they get to the quota. Admissions is holistic, and candidates may check multiple boxes (this, for example, is why I believe academically elite URMs, or highly-qualified development-level legacies face significantly better odds than applicants with a single hook). I think there may be some tweaking of the final list of admits before release to keep numbers \"balanced\", but I think it starts by picking kids that are holistically, and collectively, the best mix for the school's needs.<br><br>Second, and related to the above, I'm conscious that I haven't allowed for admits who fit in multiple categories. It would have been too complicated and speculative to try to adjust for that. I don't want to give the impression, though, that I don't believe anyone in my \"unquestionable genius\" category is URM or ORM, for example (I'm sure plenty are), or that all international admits are either Asian or institutional priorities. The groups are presented without overlap to keep things simple.<br><br>", "<b>Username: theloniusmonk</b><br><br>Good posts @DeepBlue86, note that Fareed Zarkaria (Time, CNN) did argue there was a de facto Asian quota, maybe not a number but a percentage (like more or less the ivies and Stanford will cap Asians at 20% or so). He argued it was similar to the one Jewish applicants faced when the ivies didn't want to admit them but they had the best academic credentials. But I agree that colleges should be able to choose their class as they see fit.<br><br>BTW, how do you define a genius, I thought I knew one, lol, but he got waitlisted at Stanford.<br><br>", "<b>Username: DeepBlue86</b><br><br>Personally, I think there is a de facto Asian quota, but I also believe there is a de facto legacy quota and various other de facto quotas, because the number of seats is finite and the universities want to ensure that all the constituencies I listed are well-represented - so some get squeezed.<br><br>For me, the geniuses are publishing very impressive work, winning national prizes/contests, etc.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Much2learn</b><br><br>@deepblue86 \"I also believe there is a de facto legacy quota\"<br><br>It seems to me that the benefit of legacy continues to decline every year. Legacy percents are generally declining and at some schools legacy admits have higher stats than the rest of the student body. That suggests to me that the bump for legacy is not very large.<br><br>", "<b>Username: DeepBlue86</b><br><br>I think the increased recruitment of first-gens has been paralleled by a decrease in legacy enrollment. There are only so many slots, and legacies generally need to be brilliant or connected nowadays. As I've said elsewhere, it's in the interest of the universities for the alumni to think the preference is big enough to be meaningful, and for everyone else to think it's so small as to be irrelevant. As a result, between two-thirds and 80% of legacies (who are generally more qualified than the average applicant) are denied, which still translates to significantly better odds than non-legacy applicants face. That's a topic for other threads, though.<br><br>"]}
