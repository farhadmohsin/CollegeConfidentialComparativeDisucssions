{"title": "bates vs hamilton", "comments": ["<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>First post! I have been admitted to Bates and Hamilton and I was looking for any insight on either college. I\u2019m looking for an inclusive, friendly, down to earth community with students who intermingle with different groups. I do not like clique-y schools, and I also do not like Greek life. I know that Hamilton does have fraternities and sororities, and also that those are non-residential groups. However, I\u2019m still concerned that even the presence of Greek life would create an overall preppier and maybe more snobby student body. I am also concerned that at either school a divide may exist between varsity athletes and non varisty athletes. From an academic perspective, I very much want to be in a non-competitive environment. I really appreciate being around people who are intelligent, but balanced. With Hamilton, I am most worried about it not being the better fit for me. With Bates, I am concerned that the low endowment would somehow affect my experience there and also that that is an indicator of alumni involvement and the strength of that network. Also, as ridiculous as I realize this sounds, I am worried about Bates\u2019 reputation. It seems to me that Hamilton is more highly regarded and while I know that Bates is a great school, I\u2019m worried that a Bates degree may not pull as much weight.<br>I visited both about a year ago, and went to the Bates admitted students day this past Friday. I\u2019ll be going to Hamilton\u2019s next week. Thanks for any help!<br><br>", "<b>Username: preppedparent</b><br><br>Within the NESCACs: Amherst College, Bates, Bowdoin, Colby, Conn, Hamilton, Middlebury, Trinity, Tufts, Wesleyan and Williams, I\u2019d say Bates and Hamilton are pretty evenly matched.  They\u2019re both sort of in the boonies. They are both academically sound. If you are that worried about greek life separating students, I\u2019d go with Bates. But really, I think the Hamilton campus is more beautiful. With its Science Center it\u2019s a cross between Middlebury and Amherst with its quad appointed with adirondak chairs. Hamilton has the focus on writing, and its quite the manicured campus. You can see immediately where your money is going. I think it also has a better town. Lewiston\u2013kind of run down. My choice would be Hamilton.<br><br>", "<b>Username: wisteria100</b><br><br>Congrats on 2 great choices. At both you will find friendly, inclusive kids. Yes, there is Greek life at Hamilton, but it is not the raucous in your face frats you may find at other schools.  And the participation rate is not all that high. It\u2019s like splitting hairs to find measurable differences, but Hamilton does have a more open curriculum and may have a slightly more intellectual vibe. Bates more sporty, but not jocky, if that makes sense. Hamilton may have a more diverse student body, Bates may be more community service oriented.<br><br>", "<b>Username: doschicos</b><br><br>Both are great schools. I wouldn\u2019t let the difference in endowment play into your decision as I don\u2019t think it will affect your experience and education.<br>Despite Lewiston itself, I\u2019d give a location edge to Bates. Easy access to mountains and ocean, and the city of Portland is really cool and only 40 minutes away.<br>You can\u2019t go wrong. Both are great schools. Go with where you think you\u2019ll be happier and have a better fit.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Chembiodad</b><br><br>OP, agree both are great choices to have. My DD\u2019s were accepted at several NESCAC, as well as similar Midwest schools, and will be at both upcoming accepted students day - one\u2019s a student athlete so that does play into the mix for her.<br><br>", "<b>Username: preppedparent</b><br><br>And Hamilton has the black and white cookie bakery near by\u2026just sayin <br><br>", "<b>Username: Chembiodad</b><br><br>@preppedparent, true  <br><br>", "<b>Username: lookingforward</b><br><br>The kids I know who went to Ham were happy, challenged, and are now doing well<br>Lewiston isn\u2019t so bad and the campus is active. Lots of community engagement opps, including as part of academics and/or service, which I hope OP learned about. The kids I know who went there found it inclusive.  The endowment didn\u2019t affect things in any noticeable way.  Both of mine went there,  made great friends, were highly educated, and are doing well. The alum network is as strong as you make it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: apple23</b><br><br>Hamilton seems to use some of its financial resources to make the campus a really interesting environment. As an example, they have four distinct places at which students can eat lunch on the meal plan. Over the course of your time there, you might come to appreciate these larger-school type amenities that Hamilton offers in disproportion to its enrollment.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Midwestmomofboys</b><br><br>I don\u2019t want to split hairs \u2013 they are both wonderful schools.  But on the multiple dining options at Hamilton perhaps being a reflection of greater financial resources, I don\u2019t think that is a finances thing.  On our Bates visit, I recall hearing that there was a concerted effort to consider whether to build additional dining options around campus, and with student support, the decision was it was an important part of campus culture that the community came together in a single dining hall throughout the day.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>Hamilton\u2019s multiple dining options reflect the history and culture of the school, and therefore seem like an organic complement to its nature. Beyond that, Hamilton, at 1350 acres, may effectively need multiple options. Whether this spatial luxuriance relates to financial resources may be an open question, but the inherent variety of Hamilton seems desirable in any event.<br><br>", "<b>Username: chemusic</b><br><br>What major are you considering?  Take a look at the required and elective classes.  I know someone who went to Bartes but wished she chose Hamilton.  Hamilton has stronger music and it is easier to double major there. I think you will know when you visit where you belong.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>Thanks for all the thoughtful answers!<br>@preppedparent Yes, Greek life is a huge turn off for me and for that reason I\u2019m leaning toward Bates. Though, I\u2019m still trying to keep an open mind. Campus aesthetic is only important to me up to a certain point. Wesleyan was my first choice and I applied there EDI despite its, in my opinion, average looks. I think it\u2019s the people that really make a place <br>@wisteria100 Thank you! Your characterizations are great. I don\u2019t mind sporty and I don\u2019t mind a lack of diversity as long as that doesn\u2019t mean students who feed off of each other\u2019s privilege. I also like Hamilton\u2019s open curriculum and the intellectual vibe. Would you say that Hamilton is more pre-professional?<br>I agree that after some time multiple dining options would be a draw. At the same time, it\u2019s nice to have a physical manifestation of the community engagement focus at Bates. I can appreciate both for their different benefits.<br>@chemusic I do play an instrument, but I\u2019m not in an any sort of ensemble and don\u2019t plan on being in one in college. I also don\u2019t plan on studying music. I\u2019m not positive about my major (or double major) but it will probably be psychology and/or economics and/or politics. I do have potential plans to pursue a masters.

I\u2019ve heard that it relates, at least in part, to historical factors \u2013 specifically Bates\u2019 attitude towards coeducation.<br>Bates has been coed since the mid-1800s, while most other NESCACs were all-male until around 1970. So Bates had a good 100-year head start on coeducation. Unfortunately, women didn\u2019t generally have great career opportunities or earning power during the late 1800s and early 1900s. So for most of its history, Bates was at a significant disadvantage relative to the all-male NESCACs in terms of alumni fundraising.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>Does anyone know what the party scenes are like at Hamilton and Bates?<br><br>", "<b>Username: wisteria100</b><br><br>@hopeful1660<br>To answer your question, neither school would be considered pre professional. Both solidly traditional liberal arts schools. Hamilton may be closer to Wesleyan if that was your first choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>@Lindagaf I\u2019ve read a lot of your posts and I know your daughter is currently a freshman at Bates. Could you tell me anything about her experience there socially as a non athlete? Was it hard for her to break into different groups?<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>@wisteria100 In what ways are they similar? I always thought of Hamilton as kind of preppy and Wesleyan as very liberal and non-conformist<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>Also, though I loved Wes and still do, in retrospect I\u2019ve realized that it may not have been the best fit for me.

I  hope your revisits make it easier for you to decide. It sounds from your post that you deep down prefer Bates.  Go for it!  At both, the athlete divide will be about the same.<br><br>", "<b>Username: wisteria100</b><br><br>My comparison to Wes is more academic in nature vs social. Wes and Ham are both strong in writing and Ham may be perceived as a bit more creative than Bates. Again, splitting hairs here. I think once you revisit Hamilton you will have clarity.<br><br>", "<b>Username: chemusic</b><br><br>After reading more, I think you would be happy at either.  You will know better when you visit Hamilton this week.  Be sure to eat in the cafeteria and talk to students.  Maybe attend an event on campus. Have fun.Two great choices!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Hmmm, interesting, @wisteria100 . I don\u2019t think of Hamilton as being more creative than Bates. In fact, I am impressed with how strong the arts do seem to be at Bates. There\u2019s an actual Art museum on campus. But, you know my preferences, of course:-)<br>Bates is unquestionably liberal. I would not describe it as activist. My daughter likes that. There was a \u201cget out the vote\u201d effort during the election. I know people did attend the Women\u2019s March in various cities. But no, not activist. My D thought Hamilton was preppy and that was a reason she decided not to apply there. There are preppy kids at Bates too, but I would describe most of the stduent body as leaning a little more urban, or a little more outdoorsy, mixed with geeks, athletes, and hippies. (D\u2019s roommate is a total hippy.) Last year, Bates admitted 40 first-gen to college students. It works hard to increase diversity. That is one of the reasons why it went test-optional decades ago.<br>Great question about non-athletes, @hopeful1660 . D has found them, no problem. She has been with several groups of people from the start, and has now definitely found her people. None are athletes, though a couple of them are into ultimate Frisbee, which is apparently pretty popular. She seems to now have an ever-expanding group of non-athlete friends. The college puts on fairly regular campus-wide events and everyone comes and everyone enjoys them.<br>There is partying. Bates made Princeton Review\u2019s list again for Beer drinking. My D says she doesn\u2019t know why. She isn\u2019t a big partier, and though parties happen, it\u2019s not in your face. Or maybe she is hanging out with the wrong people! I seem to recall that she did say the lacrosse team has a lot of parties. Maybe the atheltes take the place of Greek Life?<br>I am not sure about your concern for the reputation. I would say that Bates and Hamilton are both highly regarded. They have nearly identical acceptance rates. I cannot imagine that any employer would ever consider one better than the other. Bates has a very active alumni network. There are many internships and jobs offered by Bates alumni. The new president, Clayton Spencer, has raised over $120 million for the college in just four years. It has beautifully modernized buildings, and some gorgeous brand new dorms that are a thousand times nicer than the ones I saw at Hamilton, but perhaps Hamilton\u2019s dorms have been spruced up. There is, as far as I know, only one from that isn\u2019t gorgeous, but even it was given a facelift last summer. It at least has large rooms. I do not think Bates\u2019 endowment is an issue at all. Not sure if you have visited yet, but the campus and its buildings are beautiful.<br>Bates does have another big advantage, and that is its proximity to civilization. The college puts on free shuttles regularly to Freeport, which is a fun town with AMAZING shopping and restaurants. You will regularly run into kids from Bowdoin and Colby there. Also, free shuttles to Portland, which is a very cool small city. Once or twice a month, you can go to Boston for $20 for,the whole day. It\u2019s only two hours away. Lewsiton is a modest town, but there are plenty of places to eat within walking distance and the kids go out. The countryside is very beautiful there, and there is a lovely wide river where the rowing team practices. Next to campus is a bird sanctuary where kids run, and it appears, have bonfires.<br>So you can tell I think it\u2019s a great school. The retention rates between the two are very similar. You can\u2019t go wrong with either, but after reading what you are looking for, you seem like a Bobcat to me:-)<br><br>", "<b>Username: lookingforward</b><br><br>Bates\u2019s rep may be outdoorsy and liberal,  but there are lots of types, many conservatives, and D1 was involved in activism (the constructive sort. ) Both were involved in the community.  Both of mine, and many friends, were Bonner Leaders.  It\u2019s all there. My impression was how friendly kids are. Confident. Open. Directed,  but not primarily pre-professional.  Clearly, some places where Linda\u2019s and my observations don\u2019t overlap shows this variety.<br>\u201cUrban\u201d is an interesting word- in the sense that many have a comfort in various situations, have experiences to bring. But I think you\u2019d find that at Ham, too. It\u2019s a quality of the more selective NE LACs.<br>The heavy campus party scene may have diminished somewhat, as the new president announced she\u2019d clamp down. My phrase, when mine were there was, \u201cWork hard, party hard.\u201d (Though D2 spent plenty of weekend evenings in the library. And D1 joked, Sun am, everyone is back to work.) At the same time, there\u2019s a hard reason Ham made the frats non-res, parties in public areas.<br>Athletes were no divide, for mine.<br>Take a look at club and activity offerings. Also, we haven\u2019t even gotten to things like study abroad opps or how short term can be used.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>@Lindagaf Thanks for all your help! Is your daughter athletic? Part of what I\u2019m looking for is not only non-athlete groups, but sports teams who don\u2019t isolate themselves and exclude others. I play sports right now but wasn\u2019t recruited and wouldn\u2019t be a walk on even if that were an option. I am athletic but definitely wouldn\u2019t describe myself as an athlete. Similarly, I am somewhat artistic but not an artist. In all honesty I\u2019m a mix of a lot of things and because of that I fear that it would be hard for me to really fit in any group because I\u2019m not predominantly any \u2018type.\u2019 At small schools like the NESCACs I imagine kids may get pigeonholed and being the inbetween-er that I feel I am I\u2019m worried all of the pigeonholes would miss me and I\u2019d be stuck on the outside. I agree that Hamilton is preppier but not to the degree that I feel Colby and Colgate are. A moderate amount of preppy doesn\u2019t bother me. It\u2019s the characteristics that, in my experience at a preppy high school, sometimes accompany prep\u2013entitlement, snobbiness, hauteur\u2013that bother me. I have visited Bates and those new dorms are really gorgeous. It was hard to get a read on the student body because they kept us with other accepted students. The whole thing was a bit of a slighlty disorganized dog and pony show. A good one nonetheless, but still a show that I\u2019m having a hard time translating into what a more authentic experience might be like. Again, thanks everyone for the kind words!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Sorry, I saw that you did visit Bates last week. What did you think? Did you check out Gomes Chapel? I LOVE that building. They host all kinds of events there, not just religious services. I think the stained glass windows are very special, because they feature great thinkers from history, rather than Christian iconography. Overall, Bates is inclusive. It\u2019s prides itself on inclusivity, and if you read its history, you will see why.<br>@lookingforward , yes, there are conservatives, and the NY Times managed to find a Trump voter during the election, which made me smile. Clayton Spencer has been true to her word, the paryting has been diminished. Trick or Drink is relegated to history. I think a lot of it has been due to improving relations with Lewiston. I know that a lot of Bates kids volunteer in the schools, not sure how recent that is.<br>Poor D didn\u2019t even go out this weekend. She has three essays and two exams in the next few days. She is looking forward to playing with puppies and getting free massages so that she can chill out a little during finals week!<br>@hopeful1660 , just saw your post. No, D is not an athlete and has zero interest. Bates has about 40% athletes, I believe. Atheltics are very important to the school, and I suspectbits to keep the alumni happy in large part. D was worried about athletes. Her concerns were unfounded. She would say that everyone just gets along. No competitiveness, definitrly no slacking though. D mades the Dean\u2019s list, which 25% of students achieve. She loves it. She likes being around other smart, motivated kids.<br>@Chembiodad Bates has an extremely high rate of grad school acceptance. It is number 5 in producing Fulbright Scholars. Cornell produced 15, Bates had 13 last year. Given its size, that\u2019s a heck of an achievement. I think Bates doesn\u2019t care too much about USNWR. It does things the way it wants to, and always has.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Chembiodad</b><br><br>As a parent of DD\u2019s that are both heavily considering Bates and Hamilton, aside from the controversial USNWR rankings I continue to read that while Hamilton isn\u2019t considered at top 4-6 LAC it has for decades been in the next tranche as compared to Bates which seems to be a notch lower - not certain why though. Understanding that both are wonderful schools, what is the reputation of both regarding neuroscience/CS job placement (think an Artificial Intelligence job in a biotech or tech co) and law school admissions as these are the directions my DD\u2019s would be headed after undergraduate?<br><br>", "<b>Username: lookingforward</b><br><br>Like you, I love Bates. My girls were 2 diff sorts,  both happy there,  both impressively educated  (which is more than grades. )  D1 had many athlete friends, D2 was into the music. D1\u2019s friends ran the gamut, D2\u2019s happened to be more artsy,  sensitive NYC kids.  Both had some extraordinary abroad opps, esp D1.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>As far as rankings go, @Corbett is correct. In addition, Bates has a long association with the African-American community, and goes to great lengths to recruit first-gen students. Along with being one of the first test-optional schools, it\u2019s probably fair to say that all those groups were not traditionally associated with high-paying careers. It\u2019s not so much the case now, of course.<br>This is from a NY Times 2015 article, discussing a study on the effect of test scores on GPA:<br>The study \u201cfound no significant difference between nonsubmitters and submitters in graduation rates (0.6 percent lower for nonsubmitters) or cumulative G.P.A. (2.83 for nonsubmitters, 2.88 with test scores).\u201d Furthermore,<br>\u201cData also showed that nonsubmitters are more likely than submitters to be first-generation-to-college enrollees, underrepresented minorities, women, Pell Grant recipients and students with learning differences.\u201d Again, traditionally groups of people that would be expected to earn less. Yet, it\u2019s apparent that educational quality is not suffering.<br>I wasn\u2019t going to make this long, however, I had to look. Bates and Hamilton have both produced 5 Rhodes Scholars. Yet, Bates is #5 in Fulbright Scholars, whereas Hamilton is #15. So it\u2019s pretty clear that Bates is not a sub-par educational institution. It\u2019s also clear that its student body might not typically be from as high-earning a background as Hamilton, which affects endowments, which affects USNWR rankings. Bates has a now-long history of being test-optional, whereas Hamilton does not, though it has modified its test requirements over the years.<br>Re the distribution requirements, that is something my D has found surprising. The requirements are soooo loose. D was given full credit for four of her AP classes. So she has already met some of the requirements, and said to me when choosing her courses for next year, that it feels like there are no requirements. She pretty much is just taking classes she is interested in.<br>At any rate, the whole rankings thing is clearly misleading, and a different thread. A different publication\u2019s ranking will tell a different story. Anyway, OP, good luck with your decision. Either school is a great choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>@Lindagaf I liked it a lot. Even though I was felt fairly uncomfortable and awkward for most of my time there because of the way the day was set up, kids seemed happy and relaxed. They also seemed ambitious but not power hungry or competitive and I don\u2019t take that for granted. I always thought students at Bates partied a little more moderately than is perhaps the case at other colleges. Your daughter\u2019s experience seems to support that idea(?). It\u2019s also great to hear that \u201ceveryone just gets along.\u201d Is there any benefit to making the Dean\u2019s list besides the pride that I\u2019m sure comes with such an achievement?

She could have placed out of Intro Psych because she had AP psych, but chose to take it anyway.<br>She is doing an Oscar Wilde seminar for short term. No idea why she chose that. There are more interesting offerings, IMO. I would have chosen roller coaster physics or gone away somewhere, myself!<br>Re accepted students days, my D never cared for them.

Rationally I do know that the differences are essentially negligible, but after four years of hard work the rankings can be hard to ignore.

I\u2019ll be posting new threads on the Hamilton and Bates forums shortly <br>@merc81 You\u2019re 100% correct about the confirmation bias. What I don\u2019t know is whether or not that bias is more than just bias. And I know that\u2019s something only I can answer for myself. I am definitely trying to keep an open mind until I\u2019ve seen Hamilton and am in a more informed position to make my final decision.<br>The other part of this story is that I only decided to apply to Hamilton after receiving my ED1/ED2 decisions from Wes and Vassar, respectively, the latter of which was an upfront rejection and the former a deferral that led to a rejection. I knew before the ED1 deadline that I would be applying to Bates regular decision. Because of that, I toured early on in the process, I requested an alumni interview, I spoke to the Bates rep at my school\u2019s college fair, and generally did all of the things I was supposed to do not only to demonstrate interest, but also to learn more about the school. Though I also visited Hamilton before the ED1 deadline, it didn\u2019t make the original cut. I didn\u2019t interview. I didn\u2019t really demonstrate interest, and I didn\u2019t know as much about it. But I was also looking for something different then than I am now. I was more attracted to the artsy, non-conformist, uber liberal vibes that Wesleyan and Vassar both have.

At graduation, never having done real thinking about whether finance is the field they want to pursue, they end up in finance because it\u2019s the path of least resistance. Had they done some deep digging as freshmen they might have discovered they\u2019re much better suited to consulting, or academia, or business and might have pursued those fields instead.<br>While the Purposeful Work program helps students to develop a resume, network, practice interview skills, and obtain internships and/or jobs, lots of colleges\u2019 career services do that. Where the Bates program differs is in doing that deeper work I mentioned. The program includes everything from \u201cHow to Adult\u201d seminars, free one-hour lunch workshops held on multiple topics, for instance how to negotiate your first salary, or how to shop for and cook healthy meals (taught by Bates\u2019s Executive Chef) to internships, to a guest speaker series, to the Purposeful Work Infusion Project which \u201cexposes Bates students to worlds of work, questions of identity and purpose, and reflection on decision-making about work through curricular and co-curricular infusions.\u201d Bates even has a Short Term program where they have students help redesign courses taught during the regular academic year. The idea is to help students figure out what they want to do with their lives and develop real life and work skills that will lead them toward those goals instead of simply gathering lines for their resume.<br>http://www.bates.edu/purposeful-work/programs/<br><br>", "<b>Username: hopeful1660</b><br><br>Update: today was Hamilton\u2019s open house.<br>It is very, very, very rural, but the campus is beautiful. In my opinion, nicer than Bates\u2019. Most of the people I met were incredibly nice. It was preppier than Bates. I saw a lot of Vineyard Vines, although I also saw more crunchy looking kids than I expected to see. The address made by the Dean of Admissions had a focus on how accomplished the admitted students were and there was a section carved out to talk about test scores. This didn\u2019t bother me and I completely understand why they highlighted their high stats, but it was definitely a different focus than Bates\u2019 marketing pitch. The whole day was very well organized. They had kids all over to help you find where you needed to go. It was a very well run event. On the tour they mentioned their Greek life and they talked about how only 30% of people are involved and how its presence is very limited, which makes me feel like it\u2019s not limited since the school is trying to emphasize that point. I also got to sit in on a Calc 1 class. I found that the professor brought a lot of energy to the class, but the kids weren\u2019t all returning that energy and that gave me the impression that they felt like they were entitled to his effort. I did have the chance to speak with the professor later and he said that that class was an anomaly and he didn\u2019t seem like he was trying to market the school because he\u2019s only been teaching there for a short amount of time. I met a lot of great prospective families and current students, just like I did at Bates. Overall, I had a really nice visit and unfortunately it didn\u2019t make my decision as clear as I was hoping.<br><br>", "<b>Username: momcinco</b><br><br>Thanks for the update. OP. Please keep us posted.  I am interested in hearing which you decide on.<br><br>", "<b>Username: keiekei</b><br><br>I\u2019m surprised nobody has mentioned that an entire insider book has been written about Hamilton admissions, offering a good deal of insight into the school\u2019s culture.
