If there are younger kids, be aware that you will be setting a precedent or expectation of similar levels of college funding for them -- if you cannot afford that, it may be better for family harmony to avoid setting such a precedent.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bogeyorpar</b><br><br>Tough choice.<br><br>For computer science, Cornell and Washington have the best reputation. Overall prestige wise, Cornell and Rice take the lead. UCLA and UCSD are great schools for CS too, and in-state tuition is hard to beat. If I were in your shoes, I'll probably nudge kid towards UCLA or UCSD.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>@ucbalumnus, the post is from a parent. I do know that student can borrow $5500 and up to $28K? for 4 years. But Rice University would like to limit student loan to max $10K for 4 years. We don't need to worry about setting \"precedent\" :). Thanks<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br>So if I understand correctly, the yearly loans would be:<br><br>UCSD or UCLA: no loans<br>Washington: $5,500 student loan and $2,500 parent loan<br>Rice: $5,500 student loan and $4,500 parent loan<br>Cornell: $5,500 student loan and $14,500 parent loan<br><br>(student loan can increase to $6,500, $7,500, $7,500 in later years)<br><br>?<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>@bogeyorpar, Thanks.. I do agree with you about the overall prestige and I believe DS's list reflect that also. Major concern with Cornell are (1) COA and loans (2) Weather (3) Distance from CA. We will be visiting UCLA during Bruin day (04/14 - 04/5) and also Owl day at Rice to explore the campuses. If we have to pick between UCLA and UCSD (Regents) for in-state tuition, which one? Unfortunately, we cant make it to Triton day on 04/14.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>@ucbalumnus, thats pretty much correct assumption. As I have mentioned earlier Rice's policy is not to allow more than $2500 student loans. (max 10K for 4 years). However, Rice and Cornell did not include any student loans in the fin aid offer or any Federal sub/unsub parents loans. Based on this, I am assuming all the remaining $$$ is from Parent Plus loans?. We are contacting them to revise the offer to include loan options.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bogeyorpar</b><br><br>@WCbound , we (my son and I) visited all the schools you listed. We share your concern about Cornell. We drove from New York to Ithaca, and for 3 hours, there's nothing but cow country. We have not lived in the northeast but we have relatives there. When they heard Cornell, they said, \"upstate New York is so beautiful, but in the winter, there are usually 3 feet of snow on the ground and you can't go anywhere.\" The CS and Engineering buildings are very new and modern.<br><br>I also share your impression with Rice. Very nice and warm and comfortable. But it doesn't have the in-city feel, because the Rice campus and Houston itself are so sprawled out.<br><br>We live 30 minutes from UW. It has a gorgeous campus, top notch CS facilities (Allen building and the soon-to-be Gates hall), modern dorm rooms, and surrounded by high tech companies -- Amazon and Microsoft headquarters, second largest Google, Facebook, Twitter campuses, etc. The letter from CS department says \"prepare you resume, since internship recruitment events will happen soon after Fall quarter starts.\" (Your son should have received the same message.)<br><br>UCLA is in a nice neighborhood and campus is lively. When we were on campus, there was a contest of some sort outside of the gym and a huge crowd of students joined and cheered loudly. The Engineering and computer science building are not as updated as UW's .<br><br>UCSD is also in a nice neighborhood but has a different feel. Personally I like UCSD better, because I can walk to Torrey Pines and the beach. This is the only school that has Engineering and Comp Sci buildings on the main quad. Comp Sci building is very nice. However, the campus looked deserted and not as lively as UCLA and UW.<br><br>For us, UW makes the most sense, and the $10K tuition is unbeatable. For your son, he has to decide whether he likes UCLA's lively scene or UCSD's quiet STEM focus. If he likes city life, I think he'll enjoy UCLA and UW more.<br><br>", "<b>Username: robotrainbow</b><br><br>My daughter goes to rice. I am from New Jersey and at first Houston didn't seem like a real city to me compared to Philadelphia and New York. But after multiple visits to Houston I now love the city. Houston is known to be great. During the final four I heard one announcer say that San Antonia is nice but as far as he was concerned they could hold the final four in Houston every year. It is full of great neighborhoods and restaurants. It is true that the Rice campus is as bucolic as they come but there is a section of Houston called Rice Village that is vibrant and almost an extension of the campus. Rice does not serve dinner Saturday at the commissary as a way to encourage students to venture out into the city.<br>And yes there is no place in America more frigid the the center of NY state. New York isn't so bad in NY city or the Hudson river valley. Even the great lake region isn't as cold as Ithaca. But Ithaca is a cute little city and there is another college in town too. Great place in The summer.<br>Attend Owl days. Another thing to consider is that rice is a smallish school were you get much more individualized attention. There is a big difference between the size of rice and the other schools on the list<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br>How much will the amounts of parent loans affect your own finances? Presumably, you would take the loans because you do not have the money -- how would having to pay them back affect how much you can save for retirement and other things?<br><br>Seems like UCSD and UCLA are the financially safer choices with no loans needed for either him or you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>Thanks, @robotrainbow. Definitely, we will visit Rice during Owl days and also UCLA during Bruin day.. Cornell visit is bit later.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>Honestly, for CS, these schools are all peers:<br><url>https://m.slashdot.org/story/208691</url><br><br>Cornell may have a small edge on the rest (and UW a tiny edge), but really, for software recruitment, which of these he goes to won't matter. His own skills and experience will matter far more.<br><br>Cornell is a target for consulting and finance as well, however. Just something to consider.<br><br>But $20K a year ($80K total) is a lot of money. At least to me. I personally would knock UW out because it doesn't offer anything extra outside of CS, where these schools are almost the same. Cornell offers recruiting possibilities in other fields but also has it's drawbacks (it's definitely not in a city and costs a lot more). Rice offers the special residential college experience (UCSD does too in a way) and Rice is much smaller (more attention). And between UCLA and UCSD, you should let it comes down to fit (and maybe whatever special things Regents offers). He'll have to decide how much fit matters.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>And here are Payscale's ranking by salary of CS majors:<br>Payscale actually has it<br>Cornell-UCSD-UW-Rice-UCLA.<br><br>But really, they're peers in CS.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>Thanks, @PurpleTitan. One thing was not clear to me about UW. What do you mean by \"knock UW out because it doesn't offer anything extra outside of CS\" Is that related course offerings, job offers (there are tech giants in Seattle), social life, campus, etc?<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>UW doesn't offer the extra opportunities in consulting/finance that Cornell does or the smallness/residential colleges of Rice and costs more than UCLA/UCSD, and when it comes to employment, these 5 schools are all peers in CS, so that fit stuff (social life and campus) has to be really overwhelming for UW to even be in the discussion.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>@bogeyorpar, we do share similar concerns. :) Hopefully, we can narrow it down to 2 colleges in the coming days.<br><br>", "<b>Username: UWfromCA</b><br><br>#14 Indeed, it is. :)<br><br>", "<b>Username: theloniusmonk</b><br><br>I would lean to UCLA as well, one other thing to consider is if your son changes majors, what would be the best college to explore other disciplines or even if he stays in CS, get a minor or concentration. Most of the depts at UCLA are very good that you can do that.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br>Although if changing major is a possibility, consider whether the other possible majors at each school are competitive admission.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>I believe it's easy to switch to any major at Rice. Probably most majors at Cornell.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>@PurpleTitan, I agree with you about UW. It does not provide that extra opportunities in consulting/finance area but our DS is more interested in tech related jobs after graduation. Even I read somewhere that UW's courses/academics is tailor made for tech companies in Seattle (may be they get too much donations from these companies?). We are also discussing about course offerings/ max AP credits, job/ internship / research / opportunities at all the 5 colleges, possibilities of completing graduation in 3 or 3.5years without compromising his interests.. So many things to consider..<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>Make a spreadsheet. Assign points to each area that he cares about.<br><br>If he's deadset on tech jobs, it's hard to justify the extra costs and freezing winters of Cornell.<br><br>", "<b>Username: UWfromCA</b><br><br>#20, Given those considerations, Washington, which rolls out the red carpet to CS direct admits (offered to about 250 out of 5,000 applicants, perhaps a dozen or so OOS), would be an excellent choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>@PurpleTitan , @ucbalumnus, @theloniusmonk, DS is committed to CS major and don't think he will change his major, He has done a lot of coding (for his age), tutoring/job and internships in CS etc. He may choose another minor in college. He did not even bother to apply for comp. engg.<br><br>", "<b>Username: UWfromCA</b><br><br>#23, regarding adding a major or minor to CS, Prof. Ed Lazowska (Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Chair at UW CSE) mentioned in a Quora article:<br><br>At the University of Washington we have two degree programs: a B.S. in Computer Science offered through the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, and a B.S. in Computer Engineering offered through the College of Engineering. ...

I'll post our experience and any new/interesting facts we learn from the visits.<br><br>", "<b>Username: robotrainbow</b><br><br>You have probably researched this but my experience, Rice takes all AP credit. It was the only school my son or daughter looked at that did. Also Rice has no core curriculum or required classes. I think there is some slight distribution requirement but if there was that was fulfilled by the AP credits she brought in. She could have graduated in three years but is planning to go back her senior year as she decided to dual major.<br>Our experiences at Rice: Daughter got paid job doing research in her field freshman year, was invited summer before sophomore year by her professor to do excavation in Tanzania. Did study abroad junior year with full financial aid carryover. Was informally allowed to keep her things at her college(dorm) during the semester abroad set up by her house mother (not proper title). Has been invited to dinner at a professor's house multiple times. This summer has a job at Rice doing research related to her other major That what I meant by more personal attention.<br>Downside of rice is that housing is very tight and not guaranteed all four years. If you are into sports little interest by student body in D1 sports teams, and no fraternities if you wanted that.<br>All good choices. I did read an article extolling state colleges saying UW was a pipeline to Microsoft. Ithaca is a really cute town and the finger lakes region is gorgeous.<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>@robotrainbow, Excellent points and thats the advantage of small colleges. Students get a lots of attention/help whenever needed. Congratulations to your daughter and proud parents.<br>We did take a look at the AP credits given by Rice and other colleges. Rice is far better than other colleges. DS will have 12 AP/Honors in HS and has scored 5/5 in 7 subjects so far (5 more is due in this year). He would get a lot of credits based on the course selection. Rice will definitely will remain on his priority list and waiting for Owl days to explore more.<br>Thanks...<br><br>", "<b>Username: WCbound</b><br><br>Just an update: Finally zeroed on UCLA. After all visits, discussion with friends/family members, current students, faculty members, etc, DS decided on UCLA. The UCLA campus, reputation, food on campus :), job/research/internship opportunities, in-state tuition, close to family, LA city/weather/social life played major role. We are all happy with his decision and quite sure that he will have fantastic times there.<br>Thanks CC community for all your valuable feedback..<br>Go Bruins!<br><br>", "<b>Username: blevine</b><br><br>Son graduating cornell.
