Kenyon\u2019s lack of socioeconomic/racial diversity bothers me, but I love the feel of the campus and community and i fell in love w it when i visited. I also want a school w friendly and welcoming students, and I\u2019m wondering if the \u201cwannabe new yorker\u201d population at Vassar gives Kenyon an edge in this department. I would also like to hear about the social scene and student vibes of both colleges in general, and whether or not greek life actually controls the social scene at kenyon, because i\u2019m not into that. any advice on why i should choose either one or just the differences between them would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Dancer41</b><br><br>I\u2019m a parent so take this for what you will. Visited both schools with my daughter and full disclosure am a Vassar grad. My daughter and I found the opposite of what you\u2019re expecting about the students. Vassar students were more down to earth, seemed happy and I would not describe as New York wanna bes. We both found more of a pretentious vibe at Kenyon and not one person looked up or smiled. The folks in admissions, including the student interviewer my daughter met with, were down right rude with a snobby air. Also Kenyon is very isolated so that\u2019s a consideration as well. Poughkeepsie leaves a lot to be desired but the area around campus is nice and NYC is an option although it\u2019s not so close that you\u2019d be heading there every weekend. We saw confederate flags all over the area near Kenyon - a huge turn off for us at least. I know others will have other opinions - maybe we just hit Kenyon on a bad day.

Never got a NY \u201cwanna be\u201d vibe at Vassar, felt very down to earth, not pretentious, and I appreciated the formerly-women\u2019s college vibe of a school with no football team and no greek life. Kenyon feels \u2013 your mileage may vary \u2013 like a place where city, private school kids go. Of course, that is not the only demographic at Kenyon, but it definitely feels more wealthy, more homogenous (and is) than some peer schools. Greek life is about 25% at Kenyon, and though students don\u2019t live in the greek life houses, the housing office designates certain blocks of dorm rooms  for members of specific chapters, so that greek life members live together.<br>So yes, I agree with other posters that I perceive the schools the flip of how you did.

The only problem is that I found Oberlin to be too much of a bubble. I\u2019m one of the most liberal students at my high school and in charge of a lot of the student diversity work, but Oberlin almost felt homogeneous for me and felt like a white hyperliberal bubble where students only adopt liberal views because it\u2019s the norm. I hope Vassar is different than that, but I\u2019m assuming they have a lot of overlap.<br><br>", "<b>Username: apple23</b><br><br>As the one person here who has a child who attends Kenyon, I encourage you to carefully consider my opinion and my daughter\u2019s experience.<br>A little background. My daughter is not a city, private school kid. She was educated in a public school system in rural New England. At Kenyon she has many friends from all sorts of places and backgrounds. While diversity might be an issue, the school has made a serious effort to attract a diverse student body. These efforts have resulted in the most diverse first-year class in the school\u2019s history.<br>Confederate flags. I have driven to Kenyon five times. Not once have I seen a Confederate flag. Do the residents of the surrounding area lean right? Yes. Has that adversely affected my daughter? No. Area residents are friendly, down-to-earth and kind. We have had numerous interactions in local businesses and not once felt out-of-place or unwelcome. The faculty and student body lean left, and there is an active, vibrant social justice element on campus. How do I know this? Because my daughter is part of it. She has participated in numerous peaceful protests, made a trip to North Dakota during her first year to support the NoDAPL movement, and currently lives in program housing with Eco-Kenyon, which is the school\u2019s environmental club.<br>As for a snobby, self-absorbed student body, this simply is not the case. Her experience, and mine when visiting, could not be further removed from this notion. We found happy, friendly students, a helpful, genuine admissions staff, and an overall pleasant atmosphere throughout campus when we initially visited. This first impression has continued to be her experience.<br>Greek life at Kenyon? Yes, it exists, but for those who (like my daughter) don\u2019t choose to join, there are plenty of  alternative social options.<br>My daughter loves her school, so much in fact that after considering the prospect of junior year abroad, she chose to remain at Kenyon. She has had fantastic, inspiring, kind and supportive professors. Her classroom experience has been enhanced by engaging and intellectual peers.<br>So, OP, my advice to you would be to thoughtfully consider what you felt when visiting these schools. As it went with my daughter, Vassar and Wesleyan were both on her list. We visited each more than once, as they were of great interest to her. She also loved Hamilton, even more than these two schools. Ultimately, though, after a deferral ED1 at Hamilton, we visited Kenyon and it rose to the top as an ED2 choice. She couldn\u2019t be happier with her decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>@apple23: I think that everyone reads & respects all of the posts in this thread.

I have yet to meet a college student who says there isn\u2019t a lot of drinking on their campus - whether it is a big school, small school, rural, urban, etc. I have a friend whose daughter is a freshman at ND and her roommate is drinking four nights a week. The dorm is a party. My niece is a freshman at a big ten school. All kinds of drinking. I\u2019m guessing that, at most schools, students can choose to drink or not drink and it\u2019s their own choice. Both my friend\u2019s daughter and our niece have chosen to find like-minded kids in their classes and in club activities and they do not drink. But, yes, Kenyon is rural.

Many students choose not to partake at lots of schools but, like the \u201chow to avoid lax bro culture\u201d in another thread, for students who are looking to avoid a dominant scene, it is helpful to really talk to a lot of students and possibly spend time on campus on a Wed (usually a big party night) or weekend night and see for themselves.

It was the first school each of my kids visited and their first choice early in the process. Eventually, it came off the list, with size and location being part of that decision.  But what was right for them is not a predictor for anyone else. My perception of the student body from visits plus knowing several recent grads and current students, is that there is a sophistication about many of the students that feels \u201curban/east coast.\u201d I would contrast that with, say, Grinnell, which is also a wonderful school with wonderful faculty and engaged students, but feels more \u201cmidwest nice\u201d than \u201ceast coast cool.\u201d Of course, there are students who don\u2019t fit that description at either school.

My experience at Vassar will be different since I have only been to a Friday morning tour & info session & during my overnight there won\u2019t be any special programming, but I\u2019m sure Vassar will still be great. Ultimately I will probably apply ED1 to Kenyon because of my love for the school and gut feeling, but I still want to give Vassar a try and will apply regular to the schools mentioned (Grinnell, Carleton, Colorado College, Wesleyan, Bates, Macalester, etc.) so I hope I\u2019ll have some good options.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>No \u201caxe to grind\u201d. Kenyon College\u2019s issues with respect to drinking have been well publicized for years after the death & near death of some students . At least one found dead in nearby corn field. Kenyon administrators also acknowledge that it is an ongoing issue of a serious nature.<br>Kenyon\u2019s campus is beautiful, but small.<br>And, yes, heavy drinking is not uncommon at small, rural, isolated colleges.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 2manycollegequestions4me</b><br><br>Regarding the statement \u201cheavy drinking is not uncommon at small, rural, isolated colleges.\u201d<br>This is true, however the thing to keep in mind (and look for if you are trying to avoid a school with a party/drinking culture) is does the college provide other opportunities on the weekend AND are they well attended. Kenyon\u2019s plays sell out on Saturday nights, and my daughter has gone to several improv shows. They are standing room only\u2014the students attend these activities! Rocky horror picture show, Harry Potter themed fun, a game of murder mystery held in one of the commons are all activities she has mentioned just in this first semester. Of course many kids go to parties afterward (my daughter usually does one of the two weekend nights) but being an athlete she sometimes turns in early or just hangs out in a friend\u2019s dorm after going to the campus activities.<br>I went to an unranked small catholic college myself, and there were never activities offered on campus like that\u2026 or if they were, hardly anyone went. That is the key to look for in my opinion if you have a child who wants to do more than go to parties every weekend. Look to see what the college does offer, AND do the students attend! I tend to think because Kenyon is so rural that administration makes a conscious effort to provide opportunities on the weekends. Schools that have a big city near by often times don\u2019t bother because so many students just leave campus. Another reason that small/rural can contribute to a real sense of community. At least that has been my daughter\u2019s experience so far.<br><br>", "<b>Username: apple23</b><br><br>The tragic Kenyon death that @Publisher continuously refers to occurred in 2005. That\u2019s quite long ago, and much has changed at the school since then with respect to substance use awareness and education. As parents of current Kenyon students, @2manycollegequestions4me and I have seen our daughters have great social experiences while taking advantage of many extracurricular opportunities that do not involve alcohol.<br>Drinking related tragedies happen every year on college campuses. Do we paint Penn State, Clemson, Lafayette, Middlebury, Boston University, University of Chicago and UC San Diego all with the same broad stroke, and without consideration of circumstances and statistics? All of these schools have had students die in alcohol related incidents since the 2005 death at Kenyon. Note also, they are not all LACs in rural locations.<br>Again, any student death is a tragic occurrence. However, I think we need to keep the Kenyon incident in perspective.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>There was more than just one incident even though just one death.<br>Do not blame this on me. Just read the recent report by Kenyon College if you think\u2013incorrectly\u2013that this excessive drinking problem has been resolved.<br>The problem is ongoing according to Kenyon\u2019s own report.<br>P.S. Ignoring a problem does not make it go away. Kenyon College profs & administrators are doing the right thing by seeking solutions for this issue.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>Unless Kenyon\u2019s problems can be shown to be worse than the problems on other campuses, then I don\u2019t see how they would be particularly relevant to a student choosing among colleges. Unfortunately, with respect to this, you will find plenty of schools to discuss: http://compelledtoact.com/Tragic_listing/Main_listing_victims.htm.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 2manycollegequestions4me</b><br><br>@merc81 I agree. Frankly, the only reason why we are talking about it is because the administration has put it out there as they are proactively addressing the issue. So many other colleges choose to sweep it under the rug and then it fails to be a topic of conversation on these threads. @apple23 And myself both have daughters who are not partiers and who were specifically seeking something other than that when choosing a college. It was a big factor in my daughter\u2019s decision as she wanted a place where she would fit in and find people she had things in common with. Whether or not students do choose to drink on the weekends, you will find that the typical Kenyon student did not come to Kenyon to party. She has met bright, articulate, friendly, warm, welcoming people there who are interested in thoughtful discussion rather than simply making small talk.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>The post above noted\" the only reason we are talking about it is because the administration has put it out there as they are proactively addressing the issue.\"<br>We are discussing this because of the publicity that arose after the death of an intoxicated Kenyon College student who passed out & froze to death in a nearby/adjacent to campus corn field that led to the revelation that this is and remained/remains a serious issue at Kenyon College.<br>Whether one wishes to label this as \u201cproactive\u201d or \u201creactive\u201d, it is important to applaud the efforts & concern of the Kenyon College administrative staff, professors and students as reflected in the:<br>Report of the Alcohol Task Force Kenyon College March 2017.<br>The above report is available pursuant to a Google search.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br><br><br><br> Publisher:<br>\"\"<br>We are discussing this because of the publicity . . .<br>\"\"<br><br>Have you looked at the schools that appear in the link in reply #47? You could post about any of them. But note that the publicity surrounding these occurrences bears little or no relationship to their comparative frequency or deeper causes.

But overall absolutely loves it and is also driven by social justice issues. And she is from Manhattan and they rarely go into the City. So much going on for her. But perhaps others do more regularly. I wouldn\u2019t know.<br>I have no insight into Kenyon but it sounds fantastic too.<br>Drinking culture is pretty much everywhere. I think the school releasing a report and putting a light on it, probably has had a positive impact. It\u2019s quite honorable they placed principals above negative reaction.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>@merc81: Kenyon College\u2019s Alcohol Task Force was found in September 2016 to consider and recommend strategies for the Kenyon community to address the high-risk practices and behavior related to the presence and consumption of alcohol on campus.<br>Rather than guess, why not read the Kenyon College Alcohol Task Force Report of March 2017. It will be easy to cherry pick quotes supporting one\u2019s position but the merit is in the totality of the effort.<br>Again, I find this to be an admirable reactive effort.<br>Of course, there is alcohol consumption on almost all college campuses, but it is a more dominant culture on some campuses than others. I believe that it was a Harvard study that defined the major risk factors/prototype schools. Kenyon fits the profile in theory & in fact. Doesn\u2019t mean that every student drinks or drinks excessively or that anyone is forced to drink. On the other hand  ignorance is bliss.<br>P.S. I do not know why this thread was revived by a poster who opened an account to do so. In my opinion, this thread has served its purpose\u2013and has been very informative based on the outside sources referenced.<br>And, FWIW, the culture continues as reported by the son of a frequent poster who recently visited Kenyon on an overnight visit.<br><br>", "<b>Username: emptynesteryet</b><br><br>My opinion on Kenyon drinking is it felt like a very big thing.

I wanted to post something on this discussion because I feel that there\u2019s some misinformation being put out here, or at least information that doesn\u2019t jibe with my own experience.<br>I looked at Vassar early on in my college search. It\u2019s a great school, but it felt too much like the private high school I attended in San Francisco. That\u2019s a personal perspective, obviously. My high school teammate is now playing at Vassar and loves it.<br>My final college choices were Oberlin, Carleton, Macalester, Bates and Kenyon. All great schools. Of these, Kenyon felt the most comfortable for me. I\u2019m interested in the humanities (a likely English major) and Kenyon\u2019s offerings in this area seemed to be the strongest of those colleges. I loved the look of Kenyon\u2019s campus, and after 4 years of high school in the middle of San Francisco, I was also attracted to the rural setting of Kenyon.<br>As to the drinking culture at Kenyon, some of what\u2019s being presented on this thread doesn\u2019t ring true to me. Of course, there is drinking at Kenyon. But I have never felt pressured to drink, there are many students who do not drink, and I have rarely seen anyone out of control at a party. In fact, Kenyon students seem especially attuned to the dangers of excessive drinking, and we are all educated about the known linkages between alcohol consumption and other problems like sexual assault. I think Kenyon\u2019s administration does a great job in this regard.<br>As to Kenyon\u2019s Greek scene, I think this may be misunderstood unless you\u2019ve experienced it up close. Kenyon\u2019s Greek organizations are more like community service clubs than traditional fraternities and sororities. Yes, most of the Greek organizations throw parties, but they are open to the whole Kenyon community. Fraternities and sororities at Kenyon don\u2019t live together (generally) and I\u2019ve always found them to be quite inclusive even if you\u2019re not a member. I think they add a lot to the campus social scene.<br>The assertions on this thread that Kenyon has problems with alcohol consumption are untrue in my experience. I\u2019d suggest - respectfully - that unless you go to Kenyon, or are an alum, parent, or employee, then perhaps you don\u2019t have the highest-quality information to report.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CAtransplant</b><br><br>@2019kid I\u2019m curious, did you ultimately apply to Kenyon ED? I never saw this thread previously but I went to Vassar a million years ago and loved it. I can\u2019t compare it to Kenyon as I\u2019ve never visited, but I did visit Vassar with my D20 and it still seemed like a great place to me.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 2manycollegequestions4me</b><br><br>@maringuy As a parent of a first year, I agree 100% with your assessment. When my daughter was first looking at colleges she was turned off if a campus had a heavy Greek presence. She even questioned Kenyon early on when she read that 1/3 of students participate in fraternities/sororities. She ultimately decided it was a non-issue when she heard from several students things like \u201cThe frat guys here are poets\u201d LOL. It turned out to be an accurate description and she has gone to several \u201call campus\u201d parties thrown by the fraternities. Where on earth can you find fraternities that invite the whole campus? <br><br>", "<b>Username: ichibanmama</b><br><br>As a parent of a current Kenyon student - my son doesn\u2019t drink on campus, that\u2019s not this thing. He enjoys the school very much. I think it is up to the person after all who makes decisions! His first roommate transferred after one semester, so obviously it\u2019s not for everyone, but he and his circle of friends sure loves it there.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ichibanmama</b><br><br>@2019kid I don\u2019t know if the owner of this thread is reading this any more, but my son is very heavily involved in diversity groups such as men of color etc. He has been the DA (Diversity advisor I think)  Very social justice oriented since his HS days. You can ask me questions (and I\u2019ll ask him) if you have questions. I don\u2019t know when you have to accept your decisions and maybe you already have chosen one, but I happened to see this just now. Sorry.<br><br>"]}
