Even with the need-based scholarship, it is going to cost me about 70000 USD (according to Harvard\u2019s calculator) which is a lot of money for my family. Hence I would like to apply for the school which has maximum job opportunities in the USA (or other countries) for Indians which will help me repay my investment.<br>Interests - My main interests are Physics + Maths but these are negotiable. I am willing to study anything from CS to business management to Economics as along as (i) it is not arts or soft humanities and (ii) gives a really well-paying job to justify the price spent. I am pretty sure that I will enjoy learning them based on my experience with learning topics by myself until now.<br>Factors to consider - Which school has the best aid policy for international historically, the H1B situation for Indians, do companies from USA/other countries hold job fairs where Internationals (Indians) are allowed, is the job a well-paying one where I can reasonably expect to pay back the cost of my education in one or two years ($100000 per annum salary in the USA)<br>Question - Which school and which major gives suits me the best?<br>Additional Question - How accurate is Harvard\u2019s Financial Calculator for International Students in India (it is the only calculator which works for internationals). A few friends told me that the calculator is very biased for internationals and the actual amount needed to pay is almost 6 times what is shown on the calculator and that this is true for all the 4 schools.

Each of those colleges, including Stanford (oops, I meant Princeton, right?) is aware that thousands of international kids are looking for the same thing as you, including financial aid. They are not going to admit you unless you give them what they are looking for. They won\u2019t admit you because YOU want a good career and can\u2019t afford the tuition without aid.

Rather, the government is less willing to give them out to entry-level workers.

First, all of these schools, while certainly hoping and expecting to produce many financially successful alumni, are about much more than than the paychecks for your first few years. Second, your reasoning is circular. You need to go to a fancy, expensive American school so you can make enough money to pay back the cost of going to a fancy, expensive American school.

I am not aware of salaries in Europe but I am summing that visa situation there is much more friendlier to Indians than USA. If yes, is the salary enough to pay back 70k with in 2-3 years?<br><br>", "<b>Username: ttauri</b><br><br>It might seem that I speculating too much when I don\u2019t have admission at all (and going by the abysmal admit rate of Indians this is the most likely result) but I want to have as much info as I can have before i commit to apply and I crossover this is the best place. If anyone knows done better website where I can ask these question, feel free to recommend!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Eeyore123</b><br><br>For MIT 2017 grads with a BS entering industry, the median salary was $85,000 according to MIT.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jmtabb</b><br><br>I think you are trying to get a hard answer when there are no hard answers available.<br>With only 5 Indian graduates per year at any of these schools, the odds of someone here having firsthand knowledge of exactly what you are asking for is pretty small.<br>And you have made comments that make people question why you are looking at these US universities and how you will pay for them.<br>So I\u2019ll cut to the chase a bit -  your chances are low.  Very low.  You need to be able to explain why Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT (or wherever) is the correct next step for you, in a convincing way that does not include \u201cso I can get a great job that pays $100k when I graduate\u201d.<br>Do you have a chance of admittance at one of these schools?  Presumably yes given the Olympiad medal you have referenced.  But schools will also need top grades, top test scores and an interesting narrative.  And there are still no guarantees.  My daughter\u2019s high school had two students with big accomplishments apply to MIT last year -  one was a Siemen\u2019s Science award winner and the other was an ISEF award winner.  One was admitted to MIT, the other waitlisted.  Both are of Indian descent, but I do not know if they are US citizens.<br>Can you get a well paying job right out of university?  Sure.  No one here can tell you what the salary will be, where the job would be, and if it will let you pay back your expected loans on the schedule you are suggesting.  If you cannot get a well paying job out of any of these  universities, the problem will be something other than the name of the school you attended.<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsenior1</b><br><br>Not sure how accurate this website is but it breaks down pay scales at MIT by degree and major.  https://www.payscale.com/research/US/School=Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology_(MIT)/Salary/by_Degree<br>Try asking your specific question about work visas on the international student forum on CC.   You may get more answers.<br>I think the reason you are getting frustrated with the responses here is that no one can predict how long it will take you to pay back student debt.  There are just too many variables - the main one being the cost of living where you get a job.   And unfortunately, cities with highest starting salaries tend to have the highest cost of living.<br>As far as H1B visas, my husband\u2019s last company stopped interviewing international students for both internships and full time work because there were just too many hoops for them to jump.    Even renewing existing employees visas has become problematic.     It\u2019s absolutely not something you can count on.<br>You can also do a google search for average CS salaries in Europe and you\u2019ll get a country by country breakdown.  It varies greatly.<br>I will end by echoing the sentiments of the other posters that if payback is your main criteria for US university, you aren\u2019t going to be able to put together a compelling application.    Schools here want to know what you can contribute and bring to their campuses.     It\u2019s not enough to want to go to a prestigious school that provides aid, everyone wants that!<br>IMO, you have nothing to lose by applying since it sounds like you an afford the application fee.    If you are accepted, then worry about if it makes sense.   I think you are putting the cart before the horse.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Eeyore123</b><br><br>Trying to have $70k in free cash flow in 2-3 years is going to be tough. Never underestimate your ability to spend what you earn. If you would have told me in high school that I would be earning what I am today, I would think I would have a lot more spending money. The problem is your feeling of wealth is very localized. If you are making $200k/ but everyone around you makes $300k, you will feel \u201cpoor\u201d. If instead you are around people making $100k, you will be \u201crich\u201d.<br><br>", "<b>Username: donnaleighg</b><br><br>Entry level CS jobs from great schools (or even not so great schools) may well pay over 100k, which sounds like a lot, but they are almost always in cities where the cost of living makes it hard to save more than 10k or so (after taxes). Just a fact of life. I know, both my kids are in that situation. Not complaining-- they are debt free, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of room to pay off debt.<br><br>", "<b>Username: millie210</b><br><br>All the schools you\u2019re interested in have career services offices. Why don\u2019t you just email them, explain that you\u2019re from India, love their school, but want to be realistic about your ability to find employment in the US after graduation and ask them what the current situation is for Indians w/o us citizenship or a green card who want H1-B visas?<br>Please do not tell them how you\u2019ve got to make big money right away.<br><br>"]}
