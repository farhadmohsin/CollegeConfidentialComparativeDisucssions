{"title": "pomona college vs johns hopkins", "comments": ["<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>I recently was admitted off the waitlist for Pomona. I\u2019m extremely grateful to be in this position but it also presents a difficult choice. If anyone could give their opinion about both schools, I would really appreciate your suggestions!<br>Intended major: some combination of Computer Science, Cognitive Science, Linguistics, Philosophy<br>Pomona: Diversity; intimate feel and culture with the student body and professors while having resources/research of the large school (Claremont consortium); small classes and priority for undergrads; very good location/vibes and laid back (higher quality of life); strong academics in neuroscience, math etc; high endowment per student.<br>JHU: More recognition everywhere? (I might not want to stay on the west coast to work. personally, I don\u2019t care about prestige but it is what some people consider); stronger alumni network; however the location is a minus, I really didn\u2019t like Baltimore that much when I visited; a larger school with more opportunities and more qualified faculty (not sure how accessible they are considering profs are spread thin over their research and grad, postdoc students)? cut-throat from quite a few people I talked to? have one of the best natural language processing research center and a center for leadership education where I can do stuff like entrepreneurship. (I\u2019m not sure whether I need to learn business or management as an undergrad; I can always learn this later)<br>Both schools cost about the same. So this is not a differentiating factor. I\u2019m planning to do grad school and go into something in artificial intelligence, or work as a consultant in the field. Not quite sure. I think it\u2019s important to note I\u2019m Canadian so I might come to Toronto to do AI stuff at the Vectors Institute since Canada really wants to develop their tech industry.<br>Again I\u2019m not 100% sure of my understandings; these are simply what I heard from talking to students, parents etc. I really value everyones opinion, and if any AOs wants to chime in that would be awesome.<br>Thanks again!<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br><br><br><br> Drawcodawn:<br>\"\"<br>JHU:  \u2026 cut-throat from quite a few people I talked to<br>\"\"<br><br>Probably due to a large number of pre-meds there.  But it looks like your majors of interest are not the ones that tend to attract that many pre-meds, and you do not appear to be a pre-med.<br><br>", "<b>Username: aquapt</b><br><br>Neuroscience attracts tons of pre-meds. The pre-med mindset will affect your experience at either school, but probably more so at JHU where it is the reason so many seek out the school.  CogSci not quite as pre-med dominated as neuroscience, because many CogSci majors are more oriented toward Linguistics and/or CompSci.  Pomona has a joint department of CogSci and Linguistics, and offers a computation-oriented track of the CogSci major. Being in the consortium with Harvey Mudd further deepens the CS and AI offerings. But JHU is strong in CompSci too.<br>Both schools have strong departments in all of your areas of interest. And I don\u2019t think you have to worry about the strength of Pomona\u2019s reputation within any academic or academic-adjacent community. Neither should inherently advantage or disadvantage you for grad school admissions relative to the other.<br>As you know, the vibes and environments are much different. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Pomona is more nurturing and undergrad-focused, whereas Hopkins will have more going on at the graduate level if you want the exposure to that. It\u2019s a least a clear choice between two distinctly different experiences!  Both top-notch - congrats on having this tough decision to make!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@aquapt thank you for your insight. How about Pomona outside the academic community? Eventually I will not be in school. Or does the undergrad reputation not matter as much as grad school?<br><br>", "<b>Username: aquapt</b><br><br>People who know colleges at all know the top LAC\u2019s - Williams, Amherst, Pomona, etc.<br>People who don\u2019t know colleges have still heard of HYPS and the like. They\u2019ve heard of Hopkins because of the med school, but they will call it \u201cJohn Hopkins\u201d until your ears bleed. <br>Once you go to grad school, it will be the reputation of the grad school that will matter anyway, other than the occasional person who will bond over the undergrad school because they or someone in their family went there too.<br>There are reasons you might want to choose Hopkins over Pomona, but the name recognition isn\u2019t a great reason IMHO.  Neither school is lacking anything vis-a-vis reputation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>Mudd recently put some limits on CS electives due to the overwhelming number of non-Mudd students taking CS classes at Mudd.  I wouldn\u2019t count too heavily on taking many CS classes at Mudd.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@aquapt ok I see. Im curious whether you are a parent? You seem very experienced.<br>@intparent thanks for the info. Is there any way to get around it? And also what do you think of my situation?<br><br>", "<b>Username: aquapt</b><br><br>Yes, I\u2019m a parent of a Scripps student and a Rice alum. (Hence the logo mashup) But I\u2019ve known about Pomona for a long time. One of my best friends in HS (on the east coast) went to Pomona for undergrad and is now a Dean at a top 20 University. It has been a top-notch school for a very long time. I don\u2019t have much direct experience with JHU, though, other than friends who went there for medical-related postgrad programs.<br>Yes, the popularity of CS programs at Mudd and Pomona has led to staffing and course-registration issues.  Majors get priority for required classes, but not for additional electives beyond the requirements, and people are understandably unhappy about this. Hopefully some solutions will be found, but it is an issue.<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>I would call these roughly equally prestigious among people in the US who know colleges. It sounds like you aren\u2019t dwelling on rep, which is good \u2013 I just wanted to throw that out there for anyone else reading, who does care.<br>They are so different that if you figure out your main preferences \u2013 things most important to you \u2013 you\u2019ll pick the place that presents the better fit.<br>Key differences \u2013 bear in mind that some of these are typical in a U vs. LAC matchup and should not be thought to reflect poorly on Hopkins or Pomona per se:<br><br>Pomona will have smaller classes, especially in survey-level courses, and easier access to profs.<br>JHU offers more majors and classes (compare Pomona's class offerings to see how they compare in terms of breadth -- I'll assume both schools offer the majors you listed above...)<br>JHU has some D1 sports and far more research opportunities... but also far more competition for coveted research spots. (JHU does have the #1 research budget in the US, a plus if that might interest you; but available research at Pomona, meager as it is by comparison, is far more likely to go to undergrads). <br>Hopkins has an urban setting, while Pomona is more small town/suburban.<br>Weather: four seasons vs. the southern california season.<br>Hopkins does have a rep for competitiveness, but that is bound to be the case wherever pre-med is so popular. Pomona, by virtue of its less pre-professional vibe (typical of LAC vs. U...), is bound to be less competitive overall. But that doesn't mean the kids majoring in whatever you choose will be more or less competitive at either school.<br><br>These are just some of the things you might consider. I would put academic fit first: majors, classes, distribution requirements/curricular style, class sizes, overall vibe if you can get a handle on it, etc. After that, think about the environment/setting and social vibe, dorms, etc.<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>I\u2019m not sure it is fair to say JHU offers more classes given the ability to cross register at the 5Cs.  With the exception of a few areas (CS electives at Mudd right now and some art classes), I\u2019ve not heard of students unable to get the cross registration courses they want.  Of course, you still have the issue that you\u2019d have at all colleges \u2014 frosh and soph register later and get slimmer pickings.  But JHU has that, too.<br>No, I don\u2019t think there is a way around the CS electives issue at Mudd.  It isn\u2019t clear what all the steps are that will be taken to resolve it, and they are working on it, but it is possible that Mudd students might have an edge in getting those courses in the next couple of years.<br>I don\u2019t have much opinion beyond that.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@intparent by opinion I mean which you would pick if in my shoes?<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>That is what I meant.  I don\u2019t have an opinion. <br><br>", "<b>Username: SDCounty3Mom</b><br><br>I\u2019m a mom and a Pomona alumna. If you\u2019re interested in participating in research, Pomona will provide extraordinary opportunities, and you will be able to work directly with faculty. You might take a look at the faculty bios in your departments of interest to see what you think of the people you\u2019ll be interacting with. If you\u2019re an ideas person who likes to ask and answer questions and be challenged to develop your own theories, Pomona is a good fit. If you feel comfortable with, and are invigorated by the idea of developing a personal rapport with esteemed faculty, Pomona is a good fit. I still visit with my favorite faculty mentor over 20 years later. The cross-registration is indeed a cool feature of the Claremonts. Each school does have its personality and reputation behind it, but all the schools are strong, selective, and well-resourced, so it\u2019s a powerhouse there. There\u2019s one central main library for all the schools, one campus ministry center, one student health/counseling center, one main bookstore, one student newspaper.<br>Have you visited Claremont? It\u2019s very suburban and not particularly stimulating. You can easily walk to the adjacent \u201cVillage\u201d which has a movie theater, coffee shops, and restaurants, and it\u2019s cute and pleasant but nothing that\u2019s really going to ignite any curiosity or provide a lot of opportunities. The surrounding suburbs are even more ho-hum. So there\u2019s really nothing particularly advantageous about the environs there other than it\u2019s a convenient climate that doesn\u2019t impact your life much except for some days in the fall when you will wish you had air conditioning. But if you don\u2019t love Baltimore, then that\u2019s not a real factor I suppose. In my era, Pomona was relatively weak on career development and tended to send many students to either graduate school for PhDs/academia or med school, and the main supported direct placement into full-time jobs was the management consulting route. There were pockets of weak departments and some use of questionable part-time faculty for classes like calculus \u2013 but that\u2019s old data so not worth much. All the Claremont schools talk about internship opportunities but be aware that \u201cLos Angeles\u201d is a solid hour by train from Claremont, so this resource has some challenges built in. Pomona places a strong emphasis on diversity and most of the community there are students of color. In that, it feels very similar to southern California as a whole, where there\u2019s no one racial majority.<br>It\u2019s the most selective liberal arts college in the nation with a huge endowment. Still, most everyday people on the street will not have heard of it, so if you want that nod of recognition when making small talk, Pomona isn\u2019t the one. Having said all these things, I\u2019d choose Pomona again based primarily on one key principle: it\u2019s devoted to undergraduates. I think it makes sense to attend the school that is all about undergrads when an undergrad, then attend a grad school where grad students are a priority. In all, you\u2019re in a great and enviable position \u2013 congratulations and good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Corinthian</b><br><br>I\u2019m the parent of a Pomona rising senior, and I\u2019ll stick up for the village of Claremont as a nice albeit suburban town. Here\u2019s a map. http://www.thevillageclaremont.com/map.html. I\u2019m tagging @nostalgicwisdom for more feedback. I will say that the Pomona CS Department is struggling with the same issues as HMC\u2019s, which is demand that exceeds the amount of faculty available. Basically you have to be a CS major to have the necessary priority to get in classes. They will hold spaces in the introductory classes for the incoming freshmen, but after that you\u2019d better declare a CS major asap.<br>My D is an Econ major who is trying to complete a CS minor and she was shut out of the class she wanted last Spring semester as a junior. Generally cross-registration is easy and seamless but be aware that for your major some departments will require that you complete certain courses at Pomona (e.g., the Econ department requires that you take the 6 core classes for the major at Pomona). My D is currently doing an internship one of the Federal Reserve Banks. She\u2019s only been there a few days but her boss, a senior Research Economist at the Fed, told her that she is on the \u201cright tail\u201d in terms of the amount of research experience that his interns have had.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@SDCounty3Mom I have visited mudd last summer and passed by Pomona but didn\u2019t have time to do the tour. I absolutely love the laid-back, neat, cultured environment. I\u2019m fine with not going to schools. thank you for input!<br>@Corinthian I think I will major in cs so that should be fine. How easy is a double major?<br><br>", "<b>Username: intparent</b><br><br>Even CS majors at Mudd (who are Mudd students) have limitations on electives at the moment.  Declaring a CS major isn\u2019t a fix for the issue mentioned above.  The issue is being worked on, and likely will be better by the time the OP is a junior and is ready for more electives, but it is something to be aware of.<br><br>", "<b>Username: katliamom</b><br><br>One non-academic insight: For international students, I\u2019m a big fan of the East Coast. Unlike California, it has an extensive public transportation system that would allow you to explore Washington DC, New York, Boston \u2013 some of the most dynamic cities in the U.S. in addition much of the east coast seaboard. My daughter - raised in Western U.S. - loved her opportunities to explore this part of the country. Without a car.<br><br>", "<b>Username: nostalgicwisdom</b><br><br>Congratulations on getting off the waitlist. I\u2019m a 2016 Pomona grad, so I can give you some specific, current insights.<br>All of the fields you are interested in are excellent at Pomona, and a liberal arts college and community can be a particularly stimulating way to explore numerous disciplines and connect readily with people across different interests.<br>It sounds like your long-term goal is a career within computer science. Here\u2019s a look at the pros and cons of Pomona\u2019s CS at present:<br>Pros:<br><br>The community of students, faculty, and alumni is exceptional. People look out for one another and are encouraging, supportive, and kind. Your feedback is taken seriously and whenever you need help or advising, there is a lot of receptiveness to that.<br><br><br>Prepares you well academically for graduate school. Pomona is one of the top feeder schools on a per capita basis to computer science PhD programs. In fact, many people who are presently at grad school have told me the teaching and individual attention is clearly far above that of the major university they are a part of (in their own classes and in their TA capacities for undergrads there). <br>Excellent outcomes. Whether you want to go to a reputable graduate program or top notch industry job, Pomona will help you get there. I've never heard of anyone having difficulty on this regard. The Claremont Colleges are collectively seen as a target school by many tech companies, and ample on-campus recruiting and interviews make it easy to land a job or internship. Many of my friends leave with six figure salaries straight after graduation in many of the famous tech companies. For graduate school, I can't think of anyone who didn't end up at a top 10 program (MIT, Berkeley, Cornell, etc). Pomona is also one of the top schools for students getting STEM fellowships like the NSF, Goldwater, Churchill, etc.<br>Easy to engage with research and get funding for internships, independent projects, conferences, etc. This is just true for Pomona in general- there is a lot of money and programs designed to help students fund whatever they are passionate about. Harvey Mudd has a 5 college summer computer science research program as well. <br><br>Mixed:<br><br>Doing internships in LA. There are a surprising number of tech companies within the metro area, so theoretically, that would enable students to gain other experiences during the year. Most of them are in West LA/Santa Monica, however, which is quite far from Claremont (50 miles or so). Public transportation will take you 2.5 hours each way, so it\u2019s pretty necessary to have a car. But then you have to deal with LA traffic. There are a couple of tech experiences a bit closer- Pasadena, Downtown LA, USC Innovation Lab. Getting to DTLA from Claremont via public transportation is pretty straightforward.<br><br>Cons:<br><br>Classes are not as small as they are in other departments of the college. Pomona\u2019s average class size is 15, but it is difficult to find a CS class with fewer than 25 students. That said, almost none tend to be over 50 either, and even in larger classes professors take the time to know the students individually.<br><br><br>Lots of interest, but not the most ideal set-up to accommodate it. Getting into CS classes is tough if you're a non-major (they advise students to declare immediately upon arriving). If you're a CS major, you'll definitely have priority in order to graduate with the degree within four years, but many popular electives can be locked out. Pomona did just hire 2 more full time faculty, so hopefully that helps a bit. Mudd is presently in their own crisis for CS and honestly, there's a lot of uncertainty about what will happen. I think you can count on Mudd if you want to do research with a professor there, but if you want to get into a specific course, it's probably going to be a lottery (for them and for us). <br>The emphasis is pretty theoretical and isn't the sort of pre-professional, project based work that you would want to present to someone in the industry. Students and liaisons step in to cover that aspect (hackathons, student led teaching, collaborative service-based projects, etc), but the department itself is very academic. One way to alleviate this is to do Harvey Mudd's Computer Science Clinic, in which you do an industry-based project as your senior thesis. It's open to CS students regardless of home school. Most students will intern in their summers while doing research during the school year at Pomona, allowing them to be prepared both for academia and for the industry. <br>Smaller course selection within CS- at the end of the day, most of your experiences will be coming from Pomona, and it's a small school with just 1600 students and 240 professors in total. <br><br>===<br>You mentioned Johns Hopkins\u2019s stronger alumni network. I have a close friend at JHU, and that\u2019s actually one of her biggest complaints with the school. She said that it can be difficult as an undergrad to benefit from alumni experiences. All of the various constituent colleges like Bloomberg, Med School, etc. have independent identities. I think what you\u2019re referring to is that JHU is a larger school, so the alumni reach is much bigger. But in terms of actually connecting to alums and being advised from them, I feel like a small LAC like Pomona fosters a special dynamic to give back. Forbes says that 31% of Pomona grads donate, ranking it #25 for \u201cMost Grateful Grads\u201d, while JHU is 13% and ranks #48. I\u2019ve seen a lot of my CS classmates come back to Pomona to seek out interns for the companies they\u2019re working at, and there\u2019s also a larger network of 5C alums eager to support one another! So you\u2019re not only looking at people from Pomona, but from Mudd, Scripps, Pitzer, and CMC as well who you can reach out to.<br>That said, JHU is definitely more well-known, and is a world-class research university. I believe their philosophy department was just given a $75 million dollar gift. And it seems you\u2019ve identified specific facilities that excite you. So I can see the dilemma.<br>Obviously, I\u2019d pick Pomona, but I\u2019m biased. But I think if you\u2019re confident about graduate school, Pomona can help launch you to the best ones out there (and the top facilities involved with them) while giving you a transformative, once in a lifetime liberal arts college experience. Pomona is known for its rigorous academics coupled with a high quality of life & happy students. The Claremont Colleges really enrich the experience and help the school feel larger and more exciting. I\u2019m looking at a website of ratings based on student reviews, and out of 10 (the maximum):<br>Johns Hopkins vs Pomona-<br>Education Quality: 8.4 vs 8.8<br>Individual Focus: 6.6 vs 9.1<br>Collaboration: 6.6 vs 8.9<br>Friendliness: 7.4 vs 9.2<br>Faculty Accessibility: 7.3 vs 9.3<br>Social Life: 6.0 vs 7.5<br>Scholastic Success: 7.7 vs 8.9<br>Extracurricular Activities: 7.0 vs 8.0<br>University Resources: 7.3 vs 8.5<br>On another website:<br>Overall Experience at Pomona- 4.65/5<br>Overall Experience at Johns Hopkins- 4.04/5<br>It seems that students are more content at Pomona <br>Good luck with your decision- there are pros and cons to both. They\u2019re almost opposites of each other to an extent, but you\u2019re sure to have a great experience either way!<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsenior1</b><br><br>My daughter sat in on a bunch of engineering classes at JHU and was pleasantly surprised with how relaxed the vibe was and the report students had with their professor.     It was a week before exams and no one seemed particularly stressed and there were lots of smiles and laughter.     Baltimore is a pretty cool city that gets a bad rap but there is lots to do, great museums that actual abut campus, and free transportation to Inner Harbor.  It\u2019s also an easy trip to DC.<br><br>", "<b>Username: nostalgicwisdom</b><br><br>Oh, and since you mentioned double majoring- it\u2019s pretty straightforward. You can major in any of Pomona\u2019s 48 areas regardless of experience. One thing is that our majors require more courses than those at peer LACs, so you want to plan it out and let your advisers/department chairs know in order to fit everything in within four years. You can see some specific data here: http://www.pomona.edu/administration/office-registrar/reports-and-statistics/majors-and-minors (click the Double Majors tab). I see that CS/Linguistics and CS/Philosophy has been completed in the past.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@nostalgicwisdom thank you so much for your detailed response. Are you a cs major? I\u2019m mainly concerned that Pomona is not well-known outside of companies and academia, if I do work internationally (coming back to Canada). My parents are worried about prestige, and I can see why. I can see it potentially coming in handy when interacting with people less acquainted with schools. My thoughts are if I go to a reputable grad school it will not matter. For the JHU facilities I\u2019ve identified, I\u2019m not sure I will be able to contribute as much or take part in more specialized projects until later. I do think Pomona is more than sufficient in this respect. Do you personally have experience with the clinic program at Mudd and/or research at Pomona?<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevensPR</b><br><br>@Drawcodawn I would reach out to some JHU faculty and CS majors for more data points - especially on their facebook groups, reddit, and via e-mail.  You will be surprised at the response.<br>JHU does have more lay and professional name recognition than Pomona at the professional level which will help if you do not choose to go to grad school.  It also helps that all of the FANG companies recruit on campus for JHU - not sure if the same is true for Pomona (doubtful).  JHU\u2019s comp sci major is also world renowned (especially for cyber security) and small which helps tremendously.  It doesn\u2019t help that Pomona\u2019s CS program is not even ABET accredited let alone recognized.<br>To say JHU\u2019s reputation is primarily medical is a bit shortsighted.  JHU is well known in silicon valley - far more from my subjective experience versus any LAC given none of them having an engineering school save for Mudd (which is also a relative unknown).  It helps that JHU\u2019s ex-president is heavily involved in the community and Stanford (Will Brody).  And it doesn\u2019t hurt that IBM\u2019s ex ceo and chairman of the board (Samuel J. Palmisano) is a JHU alum.<br>Contrary to @nostalgicwisdom  Go to US News and compare JHU to Pomona:<br>Alumni giving rank: #6 amongst all universities (37.5%) vs Pomona (27.6%) 54th amongst all LACs.<br>Academic Reputation: JHU (4.6) Top 5 amongst all universities versus 4.4 for Pomona - top 20 amongst LACs.<br>Disclaimer:  Former JHU undergrad alum and MIT grad alum working at Google now in Mountain View.  I would choose JHU in a heartbeat and it also helps they wanted you first.  If you tell people in the valley you majored at Comp Sci at Pomona, a non-insignificant amount would have assumed you went to Calpoly Pomona since the latter actually has an engineering school.  No need to make that distinction with Hopkins.<br>As for the network, yes it exists.  I and several other JHU grads have referred fellow JHU alums to Google.  We have an SF JHU young alumni chapter that takes care of other alums for tech jobs too.<br>Pomona isn\u2019t even the top ranked LAC in US News and it does not compare to Hopkins from a CS level.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Hopkins is not a better school they are both outstanding. Top of the collegiate food chain good.  But like Berkeley, Johns Hopkins has a global brand that shouldn\u2019t be dismissed out of hand. But more importantly is where you will feel empowered to do your best work.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@nostalgicwisdom I\u2019m curious to see what you think of @stevensPR opinion? Thank you everyone for giving your opinion I really appreciate it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: nostalgicwisdom</b><br><br>No, but a lot of my close friends are, and I\u2019m part of the Facebook CS community. I was a science major in another department, so I can speak about research at Pomona.<br>It\u2019s easy to get involved- you can start from the moment you arrive on campus! I started in the second semester of my first year. The intro courses do a good job connecting you with the department so you can learn about each professor\u2019s research interests and see where you want to build experience. You mentioned an interest in AI, so here\u2019s a perspective from a recent grad to see her CS experiences both in and outside Pomona: http://www.pomona.edu/news/2018/03/22-chinasa-okolo-%E2%80%9918-coding-more-inclusive-computer-science<br>During the school year, you do research as a course- in your case, either CS199RAPO (Research Assistantship) or CS199IRPO (Independent Research). I believe there are some funds available for students who need work-study money as well. These are courses you create which are advised by a professor. Grad schools love these because it shows independence and direct research involvement. There\u2019s also a game lab at CGU: http://www.cgu.edu/center/claremont-game-lab/<br>Most upper-division labs at Pomona are structured to involve an independent research project. The work I did in two of my labs (required courses at Pomona!) was presented in research conferences, and one was turned into a paper.<br>During the summer, there are three opportunities you can use. Summer Undergrad Research Program, SURP, pays $440 per week and funds about ~200 students to engage with research with professors on-campus. An additional 30-50 projects are funded for off-campus unpaid research opportunities or independent proposals. Pomona College Summer Experience Funding (SEF) is done through the Career Development Office and funds unpaid or low-paying internships (you come up with the budget); I benefited from that to do research at a major university. Harvey Mudd sponsors a 5C summer research program in CS which sponsors 70 students for research: http://www.cs.hmc.edu/research/ This isn\u2019t as difficult to benefit from as it sounds, since the vast majority of CS students across the colleges do an internship over the summer rather than staying on campus.<br>Thesis is optional for CS at Pomona, but highly encouraged if you want to go to grad school. You can do an academic thesis (with independent research) advised by a CS professor at either Pomona or Mudd- there\u2019s an agreement between the two schools to combine professor expertise in order to manage thesis led research proposals. As seen above, Chinasa did her senior project with a Pomona professor. The alternative is Clinic, in which you are given an industry project by a company and work in teams to come up with solutions/insights. You can learn more about Clinic here (http://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/info) and see specific projects here (https://www.cs.hmc.edu/clinic/projects/). I counted 9 people from my class in the link for 2015-2016.<br><br>", "<b>Username: 57special</b><br><br>Any reason you\u2019re not considering going to U of T or Waterloo? Both are excellent for CS, and the cost would likely be far less.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevensPR</b><br><br>@privatebanker from an undergraduate education perspective, agreed.  From a CS major perspective, there is a disparity in terms of knowledge learned given ABET accreditation exists for one and not the other.  OP can also take grad level CS courses in AI, System Design, or other focus areas at JHU which helps tremendously as well.<br>@Drawcodawn If you\u2019re interested in AI, just reach out to Carol Reiley (JHU alum and wife of Andrew Ng - both needless to say are well known in the field of machine learning and AI and have been known to chat with JHU CS majors).<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@stevensPR I fully understand your points and thank you for the advice.

At google, it is extremely difficult to break into deep mind unless you have graduate schooling or prior AI knowledge which is just simply not provided at the undergrad level.  This is not even taking account changes such as blockchain that is being introduced more at the grad level as well.  So exposure in this category will deepen your expertise and will be helpful in getting you to the right group within google AI or FAIR (Facebook\u2019s AI group) should you choose that path.<br>As for cutthroat competition, it is a myth and frequent rumor mill spread by people who did not get in or go tot hopkins.  People study together.  When you go to the library or dorms, you will frequently find study groups. They compete together against the tests and not against each other since the school does not have grade inflation.  When you ask the source of these cutthroat rumors, they are time and time again by non Hopkins alums.  This goes for the premeds as well.  Ask current Hopkins students if it is cut throat there before passing judgement.<br>I personally had a blast and met my best friends at Hopkins.

I don\u2019t believe LACs without engineering are even eligible to apply, since ABET is an engineering based institution. As mentioned, the CS outcomes from Pomona are phenomenal, with students readily landing tech jobs at the top companies and graduate school destinations. If there\u2019s some evidence that Pomona CS students are suffering in comparison to students from other schools, I\u2019d like to see it. Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Alphabet all recruit across the 5Cs, and while I don\u2019t believe Netflix does, I just found 10 Pomona alumni who are presently working there and 7 at Mudd through LinkedIn.

That\u2019s hardly any different.<br><br><br>I can tell you that people constantly turn down Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, U of M, and yes, Harvey Mudd, alongside other distinguished CS programs to come to Pomona. Ask the CS majors at Pomona what other schools they were considering, and you\u2019d be surprised. There is no denying the research powerhouse strength of Johns Hopkins and its name brand, as well as the fact it has a larger, more resourced (not necessarily BETTER- in terms of quality of teaching, undergrad focus, community, etc) department. This is a classic case of small LAC vs. big university, and there are genuine reasons for picking the former without resulting in anything significant to one\u2019s potential outcomes. LinkedIn Career Insights lists the six most similar schools to Pomona as Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford, Brown, Yale, and UChicago. It may not have the same name brand as Hopkins, but at least in the USA, the people who recruit and read applications hold it to high esteem.

I graduated from JHU in 2015, so my experience is also recent.<br>See below for grad outcomes.<br>https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/careers/news/2017-fds/<br>It also helps that the reputation of JHU in silicon valley is absolutely sterling - it is where you want to be if you want to be in tech.  What is not debatable is the fact that more employers will have heard of and recognize JHU here versus Pomona given JHU\u2019s CS program is actually known.<br>@nostalgicwisdom JHU has had high stats for a while now.  It\u2019s just been slowly going up over the years from the above 1360-1530.

You can argue one school is more stats obsessed versus the other, but it could also be JHU is finding students that are more well rounded vs Pomona but with higher scores due to the STEM bent.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevensPR</b><br><br>@Drawcodawn<br>here are the pomona destinations post graduation by major for the most recent 3 classes.<br>https://www.pomona.edu/administration/career-development/where-grads-go<br><br>", "<b>Username: stevensPR</b><br><br>Based on the above info, this is how Comp Sci graduates fared from Pomona for grad school.<br>Needless to say, not everyone (or anyone) is going to Harvard or Stanford.

I need to make a decision by today so I don\u2019t have much time left. But I will try to do some more research. Did you start working at google after grad school at MIT?

Given that pomona is a smaller school and people went to cornell, mit, and cmu in 2017, I think both schools have comparable destinations.<br>Also do you know about the 5 year BS/MS program for JHU cs? isnt MS what you get for grad school?

There are several CS grad school students at Stanford from JHU for instance.<br>I worked for consulting at Bain & Co after MIT grad school and am now at Google as a product manager.  I was in the Ph.D. program at MIT but left with a fully funded master\u2019s after I determined I didn\u2019t want to stay another 4 years to complete the doctorate.<br>The factors for getting into a top graduate school with funding are research experience (first author publications help especially) and recommendations by notable professors. You will have no shortage of this at JHU with ample summer funding (see PURA and other funded research programs with JHU professors).  Test scores and GPA are next in importance.  Interviews will come into play as well.<br>I had my selection of funded grad schools (Caltech, Stanford, MIT, Columbia, etc) when I applied.  I didn\u2019t graduate at the top of my class (had about a 3.7 GPA - average at JHU is about a 3.4 now).<br>I started research sophomore year and got published in a few publications as did some of my classmates during junior year.  My professor earned his Ph.D. from Stanford and is a well respected researcher as are most professors at Hopkins. His recommendation sealed the deal as my grad school interviewers knew who he was and held his opinion in high regard.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Drawcodawn</b><br><br>@stevensPR how are you finding where people go the grad school on LinkedIn?
