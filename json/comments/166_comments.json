I speak as someone who attended Stanford, albeit a few decades ago.  I also served as a freshman advisor at Harvard College for many years, and got to know my students\u2019 academic performance quite well.<br>At these schools, I found relatively few students that were truly brilliant.  They were generally hardworking and motivated and had generally done well in the context of their local high school, or were likable enough that they could get A\u2019s from their high school teachers.  They obviously knew how to do well on standardized tests.  Many had excelled in some particular activity, although typically at a local level, not at a state or national level.  But I often wondered what the admissions office had seen to let some of these people in.<br>I was not particularly struck by students\u2019 intellectual curiosity either.  A large proportion of students were premed or prelaw or pre-business, which meant they wanted a high grade more than anything else, and often looked for the easiest courses they could take in order to achieve their goals.  There were many recruited athletes, who were not always there for their intellect.  Many students struggled with their course material.  Dinner conversations were generally about mundane, everyday topics.<br>I don\u2019t know how things are at other colleges, but I do know that at my medical school, some of the most accomplished people and those that received the highest scores on our tests came from places like USC.  Also, the Dean of Stanford Admissions has said that they could have picked a second or third set of people that were equivalent to the set they admitted.  I would imagine that the second or third set of students probably went to other top schools.<br>Anyway, I just wouldn\u2019t put the student body on some sort of lofty pedestal.
