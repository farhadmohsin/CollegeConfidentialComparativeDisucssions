My main doubt in making this decision (aside from the factors I may be accidentally overlooking) is whether the pros (which appear to be manifold) offered by Duke are worth it in return for the considerably worse engineering ranking. I have heard that the education and opportunities (internship, clubs, research, job placement, grad school) are equally available and valuable at Duke as they are at UMich. However, from my visits to both schools, and after talking to several people, I had a sense that UMich had the edge in this regard when it comes to engineering, especially considering its much larger student body, engineering department, and results at competitions.<br>I ask for your two cents in how I should go about this choice considering my interests (mentioned at the top) and the opportunities available at both of these great schools.

Just because in-state students have lower test scores than OOS students does not mean they are any less academically inclined. Most in-state applicants/students at Michigan do not spend nearly as much time preparing for those standardized tests as OOS applicants/students. The paradigm is completely different. In-state students, for the most part, do not look beyond the University of Michigan. It is their end game. They know that as long as are among the top students in their respective high school classes, they have a good shot of getting into Michigan. As such, they hardly prepare for the ACT/SAT. If you do end up at Michigan, I would caution you against underestimating your classmates. They may have slightly lower test scores, but they did not invest as much time preparing for those tests.

I simply cannot authoritative confirm that it applies to Michigan or Carnegie Mellon.<br>You have read innumerable posts on CC that focus on post-Bachelor\u2019s INITIAL career placement and the perceived benefits of university quality/stature. This really is inapplicable to someone like you, who will attend Duke, Michigan, or CMU. Yes, you\u2019ll obviously have to find an entry-level position (presumably in a highly sought-after enterprise). However, with an undergraduate engineering degree from any of these three institutions (and presuming decent academic performance) I can assure you that will not be a problem.<br>Because you will be a graduate from one of these highly reputed universities, you can afford to look forward a decade of more \u2013 your major challenges will not be at the entry-level, but rather at the entry/mid SUPERVISORY/LEADERSHIP level. Let me explain why:<br><br>Most major/large engineering and program management organizations (I based this on 40+ years experince in this business, 20+ with Lockheed Martin) soon (in about 5 years, +/- a couple) informally \u201cearmark\u201d fast-track employees.<br>They are quickly identified and placed in the most critical projects, offered subsidized to pursue advanced education (frequently MBAs), and sent to corporate/enterprise internal \u201ccharm schools.\u201d<br>While alumni from any reputable school are identified and selected, a hugely disproportionate share come from the first-tier educational institutions (especially considering how small the aggregate numbers of graduates from these \u201celite\u201d schools actually are).<br>A degree from Duke (CMU and Michigan, perhaps . . . I just don\u2019t know with certainty) is a very significant plus in quickly clearing this crucial initial hurdle, one that essentially guarantees you\u2019ll move quickly upward (critically, no firm will pay MANY thousands of dollars to \u201cgroom\u201d a youngster \u2013 postgraduate school, internal training, special job assignments \u2013 and then deny their own, costly selection by failing to promote that individual).<br><br>Once an individual is established in mid/upper-manaagement, the university\u2019s OVERALL reputation is FAR more critical than the stature of the engineering, or business, or public policy, etc. school, per se. Many most-senior public and private officials/leaders \u2013 even in engineering and programmatic enterprises \u2013 do NOT have technical backgrounds (many are MBAs or JDs), and they could not tell you if, for example, Ohio State\u2019s engineering school (or any subdivisions therein) is good, average or poor. HOWEVER, they certainly will know \u2013 and signifiantly appreciate \u2013 Duke is a superior university (again, I do not doubt they would feel that U of M and CMU are, too, I simply cannot substantiate this).<br>Allied with the foregoing, it\u2019s noteworthy that MANY young Pratt graduates opt for major \u2013 and quite lucrative \u2013 non-engineering opportunities in iBanking, consulting, business, and so forth. I believe this is noteworthy because the job marketplace views Pratt alumni so highly that they are not initially limited to \u201cpure engineering\u201d positions. That\u2019s a substantial advantage . . . and it is also very instructive. How true this is with just-graduated CMU and U of M BSEs, I do not know; but I suspect that \u201ctelling\u201d data would be readily available from the schools\u2019 placement offices.<br>I\u2019ll close with one caveat: my post is focused on large public and private enterprises, not on smaller ones. Obviously, due to the stupendous capital (and other) resource requirements necessary to complete large engineering programs with success, many young BSEs will enter such organizations (however, some will also go to small, often entrepreneurial enterprises).<br>\"\"<br><br><br>", "<b>Username: eyemgh</b><br><br>You can indeed post this question in the engineering forum, and if you want valid opinions of practicing and hiring engineers, you absolutely should.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>I firmly believe that the university matters much more than the major at the undergraduate level.

Alumni network is fantastic and rep is first tier\u201d<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Sorry pressed before it was complete.<br>Two -greats<br>One - phenomenal<br>One-  \u201cOnce is a lifetime\u201d<br>One - fantastic<br>One - first tier<br>That\u2019s Six accolades in 4 sentences. A lot more than \u201conce\u201d. Just want to be clear for OP as the debate is meaningless. Duke is in fact great.<br>Cheers and have good day.<br><br>", "<b>Username: FoxRulz</b><br><br>@Nocreativity1 If you believe in the National rankings why is it not important for a student to pay attention to the underlying rankings of what they want to study??<br>Michigan is ranked #4 Engineering!!  https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/eng-rankings<br>And Finance also #4!!  https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-finance<br>Why should a student ignore this exactly?? IF the question is Engineering between the 2 schools isn\u2019t it clear??  And since you entered Finance I think it is very clear as well.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Nocreativity1</b><br><br>Private Banker disingenuous at best. On three threads you have placed Duke behind U Michigan , Berkley and Wash U.  Not to mention the post you sight goes to great lengths to suggest Duke positive reputation is misplaced and a function of patents misplaced loyalty to Duke.<br>Fox Ruiz on your first point agreed I don\u2019t claim any engineering knowledge. Ny comments were general reputation.  On your second point Duke doesn\u2019t have a finance degree. Their economics and finance department however is ranked number one.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Not disingenuous just an actual factual quote. And if you don\u2019t think people come on here with biases and decision creep. We just disagree. And in those three cases it was advice and opinion. Nothing more and nothing less.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Nocreativity1</b><br><br>https://www.collegefactual.com/majors/social-sciences/economics/rankings/top-ranked/<br>Here you go\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: Nocreativity1</b><br><br>Privatebanker thanks for calling it what is is.  Yours is a biased view not the independent thinker you referenced yourself as earlier. A truly independent thinker doesn\u2019t allow biases to form their opinions.<br>Finally we can agree on something.<br>Cheers<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Now. That\u2019s not nice. If I think duke is great but not the be all end all that doesn\u2019t make me biased. It\u2019s called discerning.  My favorite nephew goes to Duke. I have no student there or Michigan and no student of mine has applied to either.  I have no mean boss from duke or was I ever jilted by a women from either. I\u2019m open to debate but you\u2019ve gotten a bit too personal and would suggest you move on. I will. My thoughts are generic. There are terms of service here and this has lasted one post too long.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Nocreativity1</b><br><br>Sorry bias was your word and no offense intended. I was wrong you aren\u2019t being thin skinned (as you suggested I was).<br><br>", "<b>Username: theloniusmonk</b><br><br>\u201cCmon you can\u2019t be that thin skinned.\u201d<br>I think this is a UM grad posing as a Duke grad to make Duke look bad, the rants, grammatical and spelling mistakes, not understanding the arguments, changing the discussion\u2026the post you sight, ny comments, is is, patents misplaced loyalty, Berkley<br><br>", "<b>Username: Nocreativity1</b><br><br>You caught me this is Christian Leattner<br><br>", "<b>Username: FoxRulz</b><br><br>@Nocreativity1  Global Economics and business Michigan is #12 in the world, which is still above Duke on a Global basis.  As a student and knowing the importance of a global outlook, this is impressive!!<br>https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/economics-business?page=2<br><br>", "<b>Username: Nocreativity1</b><br><br>And yes I know it\u2019s Laettner<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>@NoCreativity   That\u2019s a good one!<br><br>", "<b>Username: moooop</b><br><br>@Humblest  If you have read this whole discussion, and your name is not ironic, you have probably realized you don\u2019t belong at either Duke or Michigan. Enjoy your years at Georgia Tech!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>/\\ Hehe! Mic drop.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>I love how people are posting rankings for undergraduate business programs to claim that Michigan is better. Duke doesn\u2019t have an undergraduate business school.<br>Also, anyone who thinks that the difference in the quality of students at Princeton and Duke is greater than the difference between Duke and Michigan is misinformed. The numbers don\u2019t lie.<br>Can\u2019t wait for @Alexandre to come up with some inane excuse about how Michigan students don\u2019t care about standardized test scores. Give it a rest. No one takes an exam (specially one as consequential as the SAT) with the intention of performing poorly.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>@theloniusmonk Do you have any evidence to back up the claim that students at Pratt were rejected from schools like Michigan? Are you even vaguely familiar with the quality of Pratt\u2019s student body?<br>http://admissions.duke.edu/images/uploads/process/DukeClass2021Profile.pdf<br>Also, yield =/= selectivity. Do you really think that most of the students who got into Michigan are choosing between Michigan and Ivy Plus schools?<br>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/09/04/upshot/college-picks.html#s=1474<br>^ 78% of students admitted to Duke and Michigan choose Duke. Michigan also loses to Brown, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Penn, Yale, Princeton, Vanderbilt, Chicago, Cornell, WUSTL, Berkeley, Northwestern, USC, Hopkins, CMU, Georgetown, and Notre Dame. It ties with UCLA and UNC.<br>I\u2019m ok with school pride but let\u2019s not pretend like Michigan is Yale. It\u2019s a moderately selective state school in the midwest that has some great graduate/professional programs and is very respectable at the undergraduate level. Let\u2019s not get carried away here.<br><br>"]}
