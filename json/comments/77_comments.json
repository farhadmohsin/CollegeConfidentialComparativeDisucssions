Caltech is also a great school and with great research opportunities due to the closeness you can have with professors.<br><br>But when you consider Caltech, you must place emphasis not only on the <i>diverse</i> course offering, but on other aspects as well.<br><br>Research is a keyfactor. Why would I say that? The faculty members accessibility is something notable in Caltech. My point is, when your mentor is a faculty member, who's readily accessible, and thus help you through you research, your reserach would definitely yield better results.<br><br>Another point worth mentioning is the fact that Caltech's curriculum tends to follow a theoretical approach.<br><br>So you see, it all depends on your expectaion and objectives (yes you have to know what you're targetting in the end).<br><br>My main focus was on the research opportunities. Thus, Caltech is the school that appealed to me.<br><br>Remember, this is just my opinion. I would love to see a debate of this topic, namely from Engineering students of both schools, who could give us firsthand experience of their majors.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>I'm a mathematician, not an engineer. But the stereotype is pretty much right.<br><br>For pure, hard sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, tack on math and theoretical microeconomics), Caltech's undergraduate education is far and away the best anywhere. It has the highest available level of rigor, thoroughness, and opportunties for work that most people don't do until a Ph.D. program. There is no comparably ranked school that respects or challenges its undergraduates more. Period. That's why, in these fields, the Caltech name means as much as it does.<br><br>In engineering, Caltech (as one would expect) has some of the top names in the world in particular areas. The consensus is that MIT has broader, more industry-oriented courses. Caltech's EE is highly theoretical, like everything else. If I were an undergraduate EE major with a pretty practical bent, these would certainly be factors favoring MIT.<br><br>That said, Caltech certainly has a good number of things going for it. Undergraduates tend to get more (and more serious) research opportunities here (which also happen to be better paid), as h88 points out. Having JPL down the street doesn't hurt either, since undergraduates often participate in engineering projects that are implemented in actual space missions. So that's a plus if you're into that sort of thing. The founder of Intel went here, so it can't be too bad. And as far as jobs go, mean salary offers for EEs (with just a bachelor's degree) in 2002 were well over 60K, with half of graduates in EE offered more than 70K; even higher salaries for the top few kids are not unheard of. The figures are close to MIT's, and the averages in almost all engineering disciplines were slightly higher for Caltech. (See <url>http://www.career.caltech.edu/general/annual/2002/BS_annual_2002.htm</url> and <url>http://web.mit.edu/career/www/salary/02bycourse.html</url> for the sources of these numbers.)<br><br>So that's the story -- most of it depends on your interests and what sort of environment you like.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>This is a separate post because it speaks to a broader topic than my previous one.<br><br>Between Caltech and MIT, it seems that there's some difference of spirit. I've had a lot of time to think and talk about this question since my girlfriend attends MIT, and we compare the academic and social environments here and there. To a first-order approximation, MIT is dominated by engineering students whose hero is (approximately) Bill Gates. That is, engineering and making money are the defining interests/aspirations of a large portion of the student body.<br><br>While most people would consider that as intellectual (nerdy, what have you) as it gets, there's actually a downside. In particular, the general MIT ethos seems less contemplative and less focused on deep theoretical questions. That's great if all you care about is engineering, but a lot of people I know agree that those who enjoy thinking about and discussing more abstract (less immediately applicable) questions can feel a little marginalized there. At least, that's what I hear.<br><br>Here, most people -- even if, like a large proportion, they want to do something \"practical\" with their lives -- view the first four years of higher education as a chance to exolore, learn, and think. So weird discussions about abstract things are more common here, and the general spirit of the place is more open to that sort of thing. Lots of grass, good weather, big comfortable lounges are conducive to this. Maybe also the legacy of Feynman. I don't know.<br><br>The other bit of experience I have that allows me to compare across universities is that I took most of my courses at Princeton when I was a senior in high school. That school was sort of the opposite of my picture of MIT, in that deep thought and a more holistic mental constitution were emphasized, but at the expense of rigor in some courses and analytic strength in the student body.<br><br>So my view of Caltech is that it's like a really smart version of a school like Princeton (minus a lot of nonsense). Deep thinking is emphasized, and most people aren't in a rush to learn to build things and stuff their wallets. On the other hand, this doesn't come at the cost of losing strength in math and science, or with the presence of a lot of art majors ;-).<br><br>So that's my take on all this. Feel free to kick me if you disagree.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Samp0320</b><br><br>Theoretical microeconomics? I didn't even know Caltech had a single undergraduate class offering in that field.

I would never want to limit myself to what's going on now, but work on these \"less immediately applicable\" proposals.<br><br>As such, although Engineering is very practical, you'd definitely feel outdated if you only apply what's applicable at the time you're studying (I would guess that was your point Ben?) after some time.<br><br>More power to theories! :P<br><br>", "<b>Username: angrod</b><br><br>I'm a freshman here at MIT, and I haven't taken any engineering classes yet, just core classes. Therefore, I'm probably not knowledgeable enough to really say that much about engineering at MIT vs. Caltech.<br><br>The one thing I wanted to address was the research opportunities. While Caltech might by default have more readily accessible professors due to its small size, I think MIT's professors are as readily accessible even though they are so busy. This week I am meeting with six professors, even as a freshman, to discuss research opportunities this coming spring. All I did was send them e-mails last week and they responded promptly to set up appointments with me. The Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) here at MIT is top notch, and makes research opportunities available to all undergrads.<br><br>h88, I don't think that was quite Ben's point. (Correct me if I'm wrong Ben :)). Engineers always have to keep up with current trends, and MIT is always on the cutting edge of these trends. You'll never feel outdated. It might be true that MIT students aren't concerned about some of the deepest theoretical issues (but, cough cough, in the long run, if they aren't applicable, do they matter that much anyway? lol :))<br><br>Oh, little side point. Ben, you said that the pure sciences at Caltech were \"far and away\" the best anywhere. Well, I honestly can't say that I know that much about Caltech's program, and it might be better than MIT's. However, I find it hard to believe that it is that much better. Also, the rigour of the courses here is legendary (not just in engineering), and I would be surprised if Caltech was any harder. Just my two cents on all of this!<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>>> MIT students aren't concerned about some of the deepest theoretical issues (but, cough cough, in the long run, if they aren't applicable, do they matter that much anyway?)<br><br>Well, I dunno angrod. You tell me. Does quantum mechanics matter that much? Does number theory, which, as you know, underlies essentially all modern cryptography? How about abstract algebra, which enables essentially all advanced physics nowadays?<br><br>It's hard to find more powerful and relevant fields, but those fields weren't discovered or developed by engineers, or even by practically minded physicists. They were discovered by those concerned with highly abstruse and philosophical questions. So the answer is, yes, those issues probably do matter; and no, engineering-minded folks typically won't find or resolve them (or, at least, certainly haven't in the past).<br><br><br><br>>> Also, the rigour of the courses here is legendary (not just in engineering), and I would be surprised if Caltech was any harder.<br><br>Well, then I guess you should color yourself surprised :-). In one sense, to be fair to MIT, it's somewhat moot to compare courses (since material can be moved among different courses but still taught at both places). But if you want to play that game, many of MIT and Caltech's undergraduate math classes use the same books, and it's virtually always the case (as a fellow math student at MIT agrees) that the Caltech classes cover more of the material more thoroughly. That's just the field I know. If you want another example, graduate students in phyiscs who were undergrads at MIT often take the 106-125 sequence their first year. The rest of the students are typical Caltech junior physics majors (with a few sophomores).<br><br>But, as I said, maybe that's unfair to MIT because of the differences between the trimester and semester system. Comparing the curriculum as a whole doesn't help MIT much though because there's no question at all that Caltech's is harder. Every single frosh takes a rigorous proof-based analysis course out of Apostol, which is used in MIT's high-level theoretical math track only (but is totally standard here). That is, while an MIT student can graduate without ever having proved a single theorem, every Caltech student's first experience here is a course that the vast majority of universities (all but the ten best or so) only give to senior math majors. You might say, \"Who needs proofs,\" and I won't argue, but they're certainly *harder and more rigorous* than the standard two-course calculus sequence that comprises MIT's entire math requirement. [For the curious, the rest of the core math curriculum required of everyone includes linear algebra with proofs, multivariable calculus, diffeq, and probability with statistics: five trimesters all told. Only the calc and multivar are taken by everybody at MIT, and the \"standard\" levels of these courses there are uncontroversially easier and less theoretical.]<br><br>In physics (perhaps the most impressive field), everybody at Caltech takes a hard classical mechanics course, followed by special relativity, E&amp;M, wave mechanics with optics, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics. This is at least five trimesters of physics, but many students take six. There's no other school anywhere in the world where even the biologists and political scientists graduate knowing fairly sophisticated quantum mechanics. (MIT, by contrast, minimially requires a fairly light 8.01+8.02 sequence, whose exams are trivial to pass having taken a good AP Phys C course.)<br><br>In short, every Caltech student, by the end of sophomore year, could graduate with a math-physics double major from almost anywhere (some very good places included). The same is not true (or even approximately true) of MIT.<br><br>There is more to say, but this is enough to illustrate my point. I'm not necessarily arguing the wisdom of the core curriculum system, since that's a deep issue. But purely on the question of rigor of the curriculum both in individual fields and for the average student, it's pretty clear that there's no contest going on here.<br><br>Incidentally, I like and respect MIT, and some of my best friends go there. I have no bone to pick with the school or its choices. In many respects, I think its general tendency away from the Caltech model and toward the Harvard model is the right thing for MIT given what seem to be MIT's long-term goals. Rigor, difficulty, and depth are not the primary metrics of quality (although they come close to being my primary metrics and I'm guessing the same is true for many others reading this). But this discussion just hinges on a matter of fact about difficulty, which is not difficult to resolve.<br><br>", "<b>Username: theleet</b><br><br>wow, Ben just owned MIT. XD<br><br>", "<b>Username: angrod</b><br><br>Well, Ben, you just proved my lack of knowledge about MIT vs. Caltech. :) After reading your post I must agree with you that the Caltech science and math classes are much harder than anything required here.

I've always been amazed at the respect we get as students. My freshman year, Caltech decided to put up a sculpture. They'd contacted the guy and he'd done preliminary plans, but when the students saw them, we hated them so much that the administration ended up dropping the project. As for professors trusting us, in three years I haven't taken a single test in a classroom. Almost all of our tests our take-home. The prof tells us how much time we can use and what materials we get, and then trusts us to follow the honor code.

But I will say that, for most tastes, green is a more pleasing predominant color for a campus than grey.<br><br>Close-knitness: So, it's certainly true that MIT can be a very close-knit, happy place, in some places especially. BUT it's much easier to get left out in the cold there. A few of my close friends have relayed firsthand how the more dormlike places to live can leave people very socially isolated. YES, it's possible to be socially isolated anywhere, but at Caltech you have to try much much much harder. At MIT it's possible to be lost in the crowd by accident. Not just possible -- it happens regularly.<br><br>As for the respect of the administration and faculty, I do agree that among large universities MIT stands out, but Caltech is #1 in this category anywhere. How many other schools, including MIT, give students a key that opens most buildings on campus (and let you in to the others)? How many of them have virtually no in-class tests? How many tacitly encourage students to explore tunnels and roofs as long as they're not stupid about it? (MIT recently instituted a fine for being found on a roof.) How many have students treated as equals on pretty much every policy-setting committee (including undergraduate admissions)?

Rigor refers to the atmosphere, workload and the environment, e.g. since many Caltech undergrad take about 6 classes (for Physics, EE and ECE) the atmosphere become rigorous. On the other hand, for a similar subject, I would claim that Caltech teach slightly more deeply than MIT, i.e. the homeworks are harder :).<br><br>", "<b>Username: tetrahedr0n</b><br><br>I thought rigor meant how proof-based classes are.

Rigor depends a lot on you and your choices.<br><br>regarding close knitness its a matter of choice, each hall on EC is a very close knit group and has its own personality , deciding on where you fit in best and the fact that the school has an nearly even male to female ratio means you wont have too spend 4 years in a borderline all boys school. Central Square is right next door and has a whole lot of restaurants that cater to mit students.Delivery food is common.<br><br>as native californian i could tell you that although roses and flowers are nice, having more than one season is also a thing of beauty.

When Feynman himself taught the physics class at Caltech, whatever its name then, the class was notoriously perhaps the hardest physics class you may find in the States. And yet, his questions are based on his lectures, compiled in the form of the 3 books (you might also notice that the 3rd vol is much harder than the 1st or 2nd vols). Hence your perception on the rigor fails here as it doesn't necessarily materialize as the rigor of the class itself.<br><br>However, based on *my* definition, I consider rigor as typically how many classes an average student tend to take every term/semester. While you can of course take as many courses as you are capable to, there's indeed some invisible pressure from the environment and atmosphere of the school to dictate it. In this regard, the more nerdy environment of Caltech impose its society taking heavier workloads (than MIT) and hence spirally elevates the rigor of the atmosphere.<br><br>", "<b>Username: alleya</b><br><br>As far as rigor goes, there's more expected and required of students at Caltech than at MIT.

However, my point stands that there's no way to be a part of that environment while living off-campus. Also, yes there are more options for core classes. In fact, there are probably more options for classes in most areas -- that's an advantage of a large school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>I agree that Caltech is more rigorous than MIT in the sense that there is a wider variety of easier classes and easier majors at MIT and so in that sense, there are more places to 'hide'. MIT is therefore more accomodating to students who find that they can't or don't want to work hard and/or don't want to study technical subjects than is Caltech. In that sense, Caltech is more rigorous.<br><br>However, whether that rigor is really a good or a bad thing is, I suppose, in the eye of the beholder. The fact is, a significantly larger percentage of students at Caltech than at MIT will not graduate. Put another way, a given incoming student is more likely to eventually get a degree from MIT than he will from Caltech. Maybe that degree will not be in a subject that he really wants to study (i.e. maybe that student wanted to study EE but he either can't or doesn't want to study as hard as needed to get that EE degree, so he instead gets a degree in a less demanding subject), and maybe that student gets low grades, but at least he manages to graduate.<br><br>Hence, whether rigor is a good or a bad thing depends on whether a particular student can take the rigor. For those students who can take the Caltech rigor, then it's probably a good thing. But there are some students at Caltech who can't or don't want to take the rigor. For them, the rigor is obviously a very bad thing.<br><br>Which leads me to the possibly controversial conclusion that Caltech may need to look at its admissions policies and raise its standards and not admit borderline students, because these students are the ones who are most likely to encounter academic difficulty at Caltech. You aren't doing anybody any favors by admitting somebody only to watch him flunk out or drop out from frustration.<br><br>Some of you might respond by saying that some borderline cases turn out to become stellar Caltech students. True, but on the other hand, many other borderline students end up flunking out. And flunking out is a serious black mark on your academic record. Few other top-ranked schools will seriously consider transfer students who flunked out of their previous school. And those bad grades are a major setback if and when that student later wants to apply graduate school. Bottom line - it is clearly better to graduate from HYPSM than to flunk out of Caltech. If you can survive the rigor of Caltech, more power to you, but that's a fairly significant 'if'.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rtkysg</b><br><br>LOL ! Sakky, that's very true, however, perhaps the borderline Caltech admits typically have GPA above 3.8 and SAT above 1510 on top of their EC listing. How would the adcom know that he/she would become a borderline case later on?<br><br>Also if Caltech increases its selectivity, it would lose out most of its potential admit to MIT. This is not good in the eye of Caltech adcom economically :P<br><br>", "<b>Username: alleya</b><br><br>sakky,<br><br>Actually, very few students flunk out -- most leave before that happens. It's been argued on the board before that this is the same thing because the student was \"essentially forced out\" (I don't agree with this -- in my opinion, the school goes above and beyond to allow a student to stay if he/she wants to), but this is a moot point as far as the record is concerned. For most students, their records will just indicate that they transfered schools.<br><br>As for not admitting as many borderline cases, I don't agree with that. I don't think the borderline cases are the ones who are necessarily leaving. In my opinion, there's a certain academic threshold a person needs to pass in order to make it at Caltech. After that, it's dependent on drive, desire, and an ability to deal with high stress situations. Some people get here and realize that what they're getting here isn't worth what they're giving up. They didn't know this beforehand, so it probably wasn't readily obvious in their application. I think that the factors (above the academic threshold) which contribute to a student sinking or swimming can be very hard to see in an application. Unfortunately, to settle the debate we really need statistics of borderline cases, which is the type of thing that admissions won't (and shouldn't) release.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>To rytskg, actually I would have to disagree that those borderline students would have the statistics that you suggested. The 25th SAT percentile for Caltech was 1460, hence a full quarter of the entering class had an SAT of 1460 or less. That's a fquite sizable chunk of the entering class, you must agree. Furthermore, 94% of the entering freshmen were in the top 10% of their high school class, which obviously means that 6% were not. I would say that this is also a fairly large chunk.<br><br>Now, don't get me wrong, it is obviously true that the SAT doesn't measure everything and high school class rank also doesn't measure everything. No metric is perfect. I am not here to debate the merits of the SAT or class rank. What I am saying is that Caltech could easily go back through its historical data and examine all the students who came in but, for whatever reason, didn't make it, and then perform a statistical analysis on these students to determine if they tend to hold a specific incoming trait above a certain confidence interval. For example, Caltech might find out that of all the students they admit but don't graduate, 95% of them had an SAT score of less than 1400. Or had relatively low (that is, low for Caltech) math test scores and/or grades. Or whatever it might be. Then Caltech should then just admit less of these students.<br><br>Some of you might object that you never really know which students aren't going to make it. But that's beside the point. You obviously can never know with a 100% guarantee who is going to make it and who isn't. But statistics can tell you what is probably going to happen. It is similar to auto insurance companies deciding whether they should insure a particular driver - the worse that driver's record is, the less likely that that company will decide to insure him, until a point is reached where the insurance company will absolutely not offer insurance. A guy who has a history of DUI's and who has been in numerous accidents is probably not a good insurance risk. Hence, Caltech can set up a table of confidence intervals and determine, based on historical data, who is highly unlikely to graduate.<br><br>Also, I dispute the notion that if Caltech increased its selectivity, it would lose out most of its potential admits to MIT. That might be true if Caltech were currently admitting lots of students who aren't good enough to get into MIT, which I do not see. However, the data does not seem to indicate that Caltech is admitting a significant number of students who aren't good enough to get into MIT. On a head-to-head basis, in terms of admittees, Caltech and MIT are basically even. The other way it might be true is that people who are admitted to Caltech and MIT will tend to prefer (perhaps slightly) MIT over Caltech. If that is true (and I'm not saying that it is), I would argue that might in fact be explained by Caltech's higher rigor, which may serve to turn some people off. Simply put, some people might want the greater guarantee of getting the degree that they will get from MIT rather than put up with the greater risk from Caltech of ending up with nothing. Hence, I would argue that this is really a reversal of cause and effect.<br><br>Finally, I don't know whether Caltech's economics has anything to do with anything. Honestly, how much money are we talking about here? Considering Caltech's highly generous financial aid, I think a case could be made that Caltech is actually LOSING money from its undergraduate program. But in any case, if Caltech is in fact making a profit from its undergrad program, it's going to amount to at best a rounding error relative to the rest of the budget. The vast vast majority of Caltech's budget comes from research dollars, from alumni donations, and from interest on its accumulated endowment.<br><br>Let me put it to you this way. Caltech's endowment is something on the order of $1.2 billion. If Caltech were to invest this endowment in US Federal bonds, which are generally considered to be the safest financial vehicle in the world, Caltech would earn about $50 million a year just on endowment interest alone. Caltech enrolls about 900 undergrads, of which about 100 will eventually fail to graduate. So if Caltech were to simply not have admitted these 100 students in the first place, then that is basically a loss of about $2.5 million of tuition a year, and that presumes that each and every one of those 100 students received zero financial aid from Caltech, which is obviously ridiculous. And I haven't even begun talking about all the research money that Caltech garners or the additions to the endowment from alumni donations. Or, to quote from Caltech's published 2003 budget, \"...As<br>has been the case historically, sponsored research and gift revenues (including payout<br>from the endowment) in fiscal year 2003 provided 85 percent of the support for campus activities.\"<br><br><url>http://www.caltech.edu/at-a-glance/2002-2003CaltechFinancials.pdf</url><br><br>The point is that whatever money that Caltech might be losing from admitting fewer students is, at worst, a drop in the bucket, and payback would be in the form of improved morale within the Caltech community. I can tell you firsthand that is extraordinarily gutwrenching to watch people who you know and who you've befriended end up struggling academically and finally end up giving up and dropping out or flunking out. It's like working at a company and watching your friends getting laid off or fired. That's not fun for anybody.<br><br>Now to alleya, I would have to say that I agree with those people who say that flunking out and being forced out are basically the same thing, because at the end of the day, a student, for whatever reason, is unable to continue.<br><br>Furthermore, you have to seriously look at what is meant by the notion of 'transferring schools'. We have to be careful about our definitions here. There are obviously some students who come to Caltech and who do just fine and could graduate, but decide that they want to transfer out anyway. They are not forced out in any way, they just decide that they would rather be somewhere else, maybe someplace with a major that is more to their liking, or they just don't like Pasadena, or whatever. Every school has these students. I am not talking about these students.<br><br>What I am talking about are those students who come to Caltech and then start doing very poorly academically, either because they aren't smart enough, or they aren't motivated enough, or they aren't mature enough, or some combination or the 3. Those are the students that I am talking about. You say that they will simply transfer out somewhere, and my response is \"Transfer out to where?\". If you're good enough to get into Caltech, then you're almost certainly good enough to get into some other top 15-20 school, and you're probably good enough to have gotten into at least 1 of HYPSM. However, if you come to Caltech and then start getting a bunch of mediocre or less-than-mediocre grades, what do you think your chances are of successfully transferring into HYPSM, or even into some other top 20 school? Low indeed, you must agree. Rightly or wrongly, if you are doing badly at Caltech, then few top schools will want to admit you as a transfer. You shot the moon and you lost big. If you do end up successfully transferring out, it will probably only be to some fairly low-ranked school. In that case, that person would probably have been better off not getting admitted into Caltech in the first place. Case in point - I know one guy who was admitted to Caltech, and also to Stanford and a bunch of the lower Ivies. He chose Caltech, and barely scraped by in his first year, and wanted to transfer out. Stanford didn't want him anymore. The lower Ivies didn't want him. He ended up at UCSB. He tells me now, over and over again, that going to Caltech was probably the worst decision he made in his life, and that he should have taken Stanford when he had the chance.<br><br>Now obviously, that story was anecdotal. But it does serve to illustrate a larger point. Caltech is, in some ways, an example of 'shooting the moon'. If you go to Caltech and you do well, then the world is your oyster. But what if you don't do well? In that case, you run the significant risk of greatly hurting yourself, at least, compared to going to some other school where things are safer and you're more likely to graduate.<br><br>And finally, as to your last paragraph, we have to be careful about what we mean by 'borderline' cases. I am precisely defining 'borderline' cases as those people who are likely to leave because of poor academic performance. I am surmising that these people are probably those who have borderline academic records, but I agree that it is not necessarily so. But that's not the point. The point is that Caltech should figure out who these people are, whoever they are, and then seriously consider not admitting as many of them. I also don't believe that it really is all that difficult to determine who these people are, at least to some confidence interval. For example, Caltech might run multiple rounds of interviews for the applicants to assess who really is fired up and motivated and who isn't. Caltech might want to call up guidance counselors and teachers (basically, whoever wrote the rec's) to really determine who really has the heart to succeed, and who doesn't.<br><br>The point is, I don't think it's that hard for Caltech to find out. Caltech clearly has the budget to do it. If Caltech wants to do it, Caltech could do it. The question is, does Caltech really want to do it? I get the feeling that Caltech feels that not only is this not a real problem, I strongly suspect that Caltech actually seems to like it the way it is - that a lower graduation rate relative to HYPSM proves that Caltech is tougher and more strenuous than those other schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: webhappy</b><br><br>\"I also don't believe that it really is all that difficult to determine who these people are, at least to some confidence interval. For example, Caltech might run multiple rounds of interviews for the applicants to assess who really is fired up and motivated and who isn't.

I don't really think there's an easy way to determine the people truly willing to work hard.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rtkysg</b><br><br>Sakky,<br><br>I don't think your claim in the last paragraph was accurate, although I can't be so sure myself. But Caltech, in some of its reports, actually expresses its concern about the rigor of its curricula, which in fact has some effects on its yield rate. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to care much about such matter. Regarding the selectivity issue, I think most people agree that technically Caltech and MIT are perhaps of the hardest schools to get in, and most students take both of them as super reach schools. Now if Caltech is to increase its selectivity, my guess is many students will not even bother to apply to Caltech. I have actually encountered some people who didn't apply to Caltech because they thought paying $50 for application fee was too expensive for such a high rejection risk.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>Interesting points, sakky. Here are a few of my thoughts on them.<br><br>I read applications. I vote on who gets in. The first question I ask is \"Can this kid make it here?\" If there is even a plausible possibility that the answer is no -- no matter how much we otherwise want the student -- we tend not to take him or her. Frequently, in discussing particuarly difficult cases, admisisons officers will note that taking a certain student (and exposing him to the consequences of coming here unprepared) would be much worse than not taking him and exposing him to the relatively less severe disappointment of not getting in. We are keenly aware, in short, of the issues you raise.<br><br>How loud a \"yes\" do we require to the question of whether they can make it? To give you an idea, we sometimes get nervous a teacher fails to rate a student's academic ability at the level of \"one of the top few in my career.\" (Of course, there are many exceptions to the rule, but I'm just trying to give you an idea of how high the standards are.) The sort of kid that teachers rate as the smartest in 20 years is close to average here.<br><br>As Galen discussed on another thread, a single sub-A grade in calculus or physics without an adequate explanation is often a pretty serious issue. In particular, we know that whatever calculus or physics class you took in high school was a whole lot easier than the core classes you'll take here. If you couldn't be at the top there, there'll be some doubt about whether you can pass here. And failure isn't something we'd wish on our students.<br><br>In short, what at schools like Princeton and Harvard is considered pretty impressive math/science achievement is often considered borderline here. I can't imagine a much more rigorous screening procedure that would still be practical.<br><br>So while your concerns about protecting students from not making it are well-intentioned, I don't think we could do much more than we're doing. Plus, given the extent to which SAT scores are bunched up at the top, I doubt that statistically significant trends could be extracted from them. Here, teacher recs are much more telling. And trust me, we pay a great deal of attention to that and to the rest of the application (even though good scores are obviously important, too).<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>Now, on the broader question: It's true that Caltech gradutes a smaller percentage of its entering students than do its peer schools. My personal view is that this isn't a bad thing. My view is that it doesn't mean much to graduate from a place if failure to do so is essentially not an option (this is the case at HYPS, at least, maybe M too).<br><br>What distinguishes Caltech from its peers is that after admitting only the cream of the crop, it doesn't let them coast to a relatively certain diploma. You have to rise to a whole new level here to survive. Being the smartest kid back home is an assumption, and then Caltech forces you to get a few times smarter to graduate. It's like the Olympic team or the NBA. Everyone who is allowed to train at that level is extraordinary, but only a fraction of those survive to make it to the highest grade.<br><br>Is that for everyone? Surely not. Some people don't want the intellectual equivalent of Kenyan running camp. For the select group who do, Caltech is one of the very few places left in the country that won't let you coast, won't coddle you for being impressive enough to get in, and won't dispense obligatory self-esteem boosters.<br><br>One reward (among many) is one of the few remaining truly meaningful diplomas in American undergraduate education.<br><br>For some, all of that is frightening and off-putting. For others, it's an inspiring challenge. I'd like to keep it that way.<br><br>", "<b>Username: itsallgood</b><br><br>Ben, one of the reasons HYPS graduates such a high percentage is that there are a host of other majors they can switch to if they get blown out of engineering or the sciences.

Well since the faculty of Caltech is so small, it doesn't do well in the ranking.

The answer is NO.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>To webhappy, perhaps it would skew the distribution towards outgoing people. But the first thing I would say to that is that such a skew such a bad thing? The fact is, people who are outgoing about a particular subject tend to be the ones with greater motivation and heart about that subject. Obviously it doesn't hold in every case, but a statistical correlation probably does exist - just like there is a correlation between smoking and cancer. Not everybody who smokes gets cancer, but those who smoke have a greater likelihood (not guaranteed, but greater likelihood) of getting cancer. And surely we all know people who are normally extremely quiet but if you get them talking about something they really care about, you can't get them to shut up. For example, if you get an initially-introverted Caltech applicant talking about physics, and then you find out that he just goes on and on and on and you can't get him to stop, I think that's a fairly decent indication that this applicant is passionate about physics.<br><br>And my second response is that that's neither here nor there. I am not claiming to know exactly what are these attributes that will indicate whether a person has what it takes to succeed at Caltech. What I am claiming is that these attributes are out there and can be found out. Maybe the personal interview is a good way to do it. Maybe it isn't. Maybe interviews with teachers are a good way to do it. Maybe they aren't. I don't know. My point is not that I know what the right answer is, but rather that Caltech should take the time to find out what the answer is. I was just throwing out some possible examples out there.<br><br>Now to rtkysyg, I don't agree that higher Caltech selectivity would serve to deter applicants from applying. Harvard is unbelievably selective, yet Harvard doesn't seem to have any shortage of applicants. Far from it, in fact. Or think about the top medical schools like Johns Hopkins Medical, which are ridiculously selective, yet always seem to bag an ever-increasing number of applicants. The point is that just because you become selective doesn't automatically mean that you are going to deter applicants. In fact, I might argue that the exact opposite could happen - if Caltech becomes even more selective, then that might encourage certain applicants to apply just to 'see' whether they can get in, just like some superstars apply to Harvard even if they don't really want to go, but just to see whether they can get in (or perhaps because their parents push them to see whether they can get in).<br><br>And furthermore, if the $50 app fee is really the issue, then reduce it, or eliminate it entirely. Seriously, how much money does Caltech really make from this $50 fee? Something on the order of 2000 or so applicants (of which ~20% are admitted, and of those admitted, about half will actually matriculate) apply to Caltech undergrad each year. So we're talking about only about $100,000. With Caltech's budget, who really cares about 100k?<br><br>Now to Bengolub, I never said that Caltech doesn't screen its applicants at all. Indeed, I am well aware that it does. But at the end of the day, one fact remains indisputable - a greater proportion of Caltech students do not make it relative to peer schools like HYPSM. Caltech can talk about how it rigorously screens its students and all that good stuff, but at the end of the day, the fact remains.<br><br>Furthermore, I don't think it's even really a matter of screening at all. Rather it's a matter of 'tolerance values' and of where do you place the benefit of the doubt. Right now, with the screening process, I'm sure that Caltech admits some applicants who the adcom officers have some doubts as to whether they succeed - and these applicants disproportionately tend to flunk out. In the future, perhaps Caltech should simply admit less of these students. Now obviously nobody can ever know with a 100% guarantee who will succeed or who will not, which is why the notion of 'playing it safe' and of 'tolerance values' comes into play. Caltech could simply make its 'safety window' smaller such that a safer group of applicants were brought in, which makes it more likely that a given admitted student will actually make it. It's one thing to say that maybe you can't get more data about your applicants, it's quite another to say that you can't do more with the data that you do have. Caltech could simply say something like \"Instead of admitting the top 400 students who apply, we're only going to admit the top 300\", or whatever the numbers turn out to be (I was just making up the numbers), and I think it is fairly clear that the top 300 will be a safer choice than the top 400.<br><br>Furthermore, Ben Golub, we have to distinguish between rigor and pure punitive behavior. This is where your analogy of the Olympics or the NBA not only stops short, but is a useful analogy for what I am trying to prove. Let's say you try out for the NBA, and you do poorly. Fine, so you can't get into the NBA. But the NBA then doesn't go and ruin your professional record such that you find it difficult to play in the Continental Basketball Association or the Euro-leagues or some other pro-basketball league. Similarly, if you go to the Olympics and do really badly, that doesn't ruin your chances of going and doing something else in your life. For example, let's say that you do terrible and you come in dead-last in an Olympic event. No potential employer is going to say \"Oh, you came in dead-last, so that means that you suck and so we're not going to hire you\". No college is going to say \"Well, we thought about admitting you ,but since you really sucked in the Olympics, we're not going to admit you.\" But that's precisely what happens when somebody does badly and/or flunks out of Caltech. If you come to Caltech and do badly, not only do you ruin your chances of getting a degree from Caltech, but you also seriously injure your chances of getting a degree at any other peer school.<br><br>The point is, there's a big difference between maintaining high standards and going around unnecessarily punishing and hounding those students who don't meet those standards. It's one thing to say that Caltech should set a high bar and only those students who are strong and motivated will be rewarded with a Caltech degree. Fine. It's quite another thing to say that all those Caltech students who don't meet that high bar should have their academic records trashed such that they are hindered from doing other things in their life. If a guy can't make it through Caltech, then that's fine, don't award him the degree. But if he's not going to make it, then what purpose is served by tossing the guy's academic record into the gutter? That's just adding insult to injury.<br><br>Hence, maybe Caltech should run its first year or first-semester as pass/not-pass (similar to what MIT does), or have whatever letter grades are recorded in the first X semesters designated for internal use only, meaning that only Caltech faculty gets to see those letter grades, and outsiders only get to see grades of \"pass\" (and if the student doesn't pass a class, then no grade is recorded). Or Caltech can identify those difficult intro classes that are gateways to particular majors as ones that can be 'shielded'. For example, let's say that an incoming Caltech student thinks he wants to major in electrical engineering, but then does really badly in the intro EE classes, such that he no longer wants to major in EE anymore. Why then should that student's record have to be marred with bad EE grades? That student isn't going to be majoring in EE anyway. Caltech has already proved its point by setting a high EE standard, which that student could not reach. So what more is to be gained by sticking his record with a bunch of bad grades? If that student ends up majoring in say, economics, either at Caltech or some other school, what does it matter if he did badly in Caltech EE? That's like the Olympic analogy - if you're trying to get a job, what does it matter if you came in last in an Olympic event?<br><br>The point is, just because you have high standards doesn't mean that you have to go around gratuitously damaging the stock of the students who don't meet those standards. For those students who do well at Caltech, Caltech is obviously serving them well. But for those students who do poorly and want to transfer out, I believe Caltech should do whatever it can to help them transfer out to a good program, or at least not gratuituously hurt them from doing so. So if that means cloaking bad grades from prospective transfer programs by instituting an external pass/not-pass policy, then maybe Caltech should do that. If that means simply not assigning any course credit to any grade less than a B (hence, if you get a grade worse than a B, then you can choose whether you want to take that grade or simply not take any credit for that course at all). Or some of the other options I mentioned.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>And finally, to the last post of Ben Golub, I have always maintained that Caltech is indeed great for some people. But it is clearly not good for others. I have to agree with itsallgood that Caltech, the way it is now, is clearly a risk that some people would prefer not to take. After all - it's not like Caltech completely dominates all other schools when it comes to science/engineering. So for many people, it's a risk that isn't worth it. Again, don't get me wrong, for some people, it is worth it. But for others, it isn't.<br><br>I would also argue that if Caltech could institute a policy where high standards are maintained, but on the other hand, transferring to another school is easily faciliated should Caltech prove to be too difficult would be a great boon to the morale and to the overall desirability of the school.

Right or wrong, that's what they do. So the guy from Caltech with the 2.75 doesn't even get a chance to show what he can do.<br><br>This is particularly true of medical schools and law schools for which admissions are very much numbers- driven. If you don't have the numbers, then your application won't even be read.

The first two terms are P/F (pass/fail), and the second of those they get letter grades which are for internal use only (called shadow grades). In addition, each Caltech student can choose to P/F up to 10 classes (this must be decided while the student is in the class). So, if a student tries out an intro EE course, realizes they're going to fail and wants to switch majors, they can P/F it.

Caltech could easily meet the \"predicted\" graduation rate of 99% by offering a cream-puff curriculum and automatic A's. Would that be adding value? How can the people who came up with this formula defend graduation rate as a measure of value added?

I think I have to agree with itsallgood and say that clearly there is an indisputable issue on the table which is that Caltech graduates a lower percentage of its students than its peer institutions do. We can argue about what exactly is the source of the issue or what is the best way to fix it is, but what is not in dispute is that the issue exists.<br><br>Furthermore, one of your latest posts I believe illustrates precisely what I see as the problem. You say that Caltech makes its graduation rates public, and to paraphrase and extend what you are saying, if somebody comes to Caltech and then flunks out, it's basically his own fault, for he should have known that it was rigorous. Come on, don't you think that's a bit cold - sort of like blaming the victim? It's like the Army telling all soldiers who die in battle that it's their own fault - they should have known that joining the Army was dangerous and if they didn't want to die, they shouldn't have joined. Not only that, but you can use that logic to say that the Army shouldn't bother trying to protect its troops in battle, because after all, the soldiers knew that they were getting into something dangerous, so if they die from lack of protection, that's their own fault for joining the Army. I think we both know that that would cause a political firestorm if the Army were to ever publicly say something like that.<br><br>Hence, I think the real source of the problem is that a lot of Caltech people think that chewing up and spitting out a bunch of students is inherent to what makes Caltech special, and if a bunch of people get hurt that way, that's too bad for them.<br><br>All of this might actually be defensible if Caltech really did provide a huge boost to its graduates relative to its peers. But does it? Do Caltech graduates really enjoy substantially greater access to graduate school and/or employers than do HYPSM graduates? Is the Caltech brand-name really substantially better than those of HYPSM? I think that's dubious at best. In terms of access to graduate-school and employers, I think we would all agree that it's hard to beat the 'Harvard' name, despite Harvard's coddling and grade inflation. And, again, it's not entirely clear that Caltech enjoys a substantial advantage over Stanford or MIT when it comes to engineering or science, or over Stanford, MIT, or Harvard when it comes to science.<br><br>Case in point. Look at the backgrounds of Caltech's own graduate students and notice how not all that many of them came from Caltech undergrad. This stands in marked contrast to what happens at the graduate schools at MIT, where the most highly represented undergraduate school is, unsurprisingly, MIT. You might reply that part of that has to do with the fact that certain Caltech departments don't like taking its own undergrads for graduate study, but that is only serves as another reason not to go to Caltech for undergrad, because it means that by doing so, you reduce your chances of going to Caltech for grad.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>itsallgood -- If all you mean is engineering, then you should make it precise when you say \"higher ranked\" that you mean engineering.

It also undermines the credibility of your point.<br><br>The bottom line is that it would be easy to beat up any school by focusing on one area that is not a major focus and saying \"look, here are three schools that are better.\" Most students coming to Caltech aren't even sure exactly what aspect of science/engineering they're most interested in, and for them the overall quality matters more.

If the Stanford administration really believed what was in the letter, then why doesn't Stanford itself become more Cal-tech-ish in its grading?<br><br>Secondly, I have to say that graduation rate is in fact a valid metric to be used to assess whether a school is good or not. Let's face it. People don't just go to college just because it's fun to go to college. You go to college to get a degree. Those schools that don't facilitate its students being able to get a degree, whatever those reasons might be, deserve to get dinged for that.<br><br>And like I said, I respect the fact that Caltech wants to be rigorous. That's not the issue. Just because you're rigorous doesn't mean that you necessarily have to have a low graduation rate, relative to your peer schools. You can simply admit fewer students - making sure that those you do admit truly can handle it. After all, I think we can all agree that Johns Hopkins Medical School is unbelievably rigorous, yet almost 100% of all students who matriculate there graduate with their MD. I would also point to the LFM program at MIT (basically the combined MS in engineering + MBA from the Sloan School), which is also indisputably rigorous (for you are getting 2 master's degrees in 2 years, which is the time you would normally need to get just 1 master's), yet every single MIT LFM student in the history of the program (which has been around since 1988) has managed to graduate. The point is, you can still have rigor and a high graduation rate at the same time.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>sakky -- note that your major metric of quality that might make up for the difficulty here is success with respect to graduate schools, etc. How shallow is that?

If Caltech wants to get better as a school, then Caltech should address its weaknesses. Hence, I think it's entirely fair for Caltech to be called out for its relatively low graduation rate. If you want to get better, you have to work on your weaknesses. We all know that Caltech is a top-notch science and engineering school. But graduation rate is a problem. I don't think it does anybody any favors by pretending that it's not a problem. In the beginning of his NBA career, Michael Jordan was criticized, and rightfully so, for not being a good team player, and not being a good long-range shooter.

While I've never wavered from the main points, you have quickly slid down to nonsense and ad hominem attacks. How sad for you. But again, you have my gratitude.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CWatson42</b><br><br>As someone who was admitted EA and intends fully to attend Caltech next year, I'd like to put in my two cents. The fact that Caltech's graduation rate is not 99-100% is, in my opinion, a good thing. I want to be pushed as hard as is possible because I know that I will be getting a better education than I can anywhere else. Granted, I am more interested in math and physics than in engineering, but I am glad to see that I'm not going to get another piece of paper handed to me; you see, unlike most people, the people going to Caltech are going to college to learn, not just for that piece of paper and a high figure salary.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>Ben Golub, you really think I am losing this debate? So if you are winning, then who have you managed to convinced to be on your side? I believe I got itsallgood in my corner. So tell me again, who's losing?<br><br>Look, you have complained about ad-hominem attacks from itsallgood. I don't like adhominem attacks either. So I don't think it's proper for anybody to insinuate that somebody is losing.<br><br>You have also displayed a rather strong sense of, well, let me be frank - institutional arrogance (note, I am not saying that you are personally arrogant, but rather I am calling Caltech as possibly being arrogant). Basically, you're saying, this is the way we're going to do it, and if other people don't like it, too bad. Fine. Fair enough. But when strong students decide that they don't want to go to Caltech because of its purported 'rigor', then you have nobody to blame for that but yourself. It is precisely this resistance to change and 'not-invented-here' syndrome, and basically, a categorical refusal to learn from others that hinders certain organizations from getting better.<br><br>Besides, look at it this way. You talk about a story of Caltech math students getting into the Princeton graduate math program, and you compare that to the size of MIT and Harvard, as proof of the supposedly disproportionately large influence that Caltech has. Oh really? Does it really prove that? First of all, the vast majority of Harvard students study humanities or social sciences, so clearly they would have no interest in going to a math graduate program. The vast majority of MIT students study engineering, and engineering students generally are not interested in getting graduate math degrees. Hence, the fact that MIT and Harvard have larger total student bodies does not by itself show that Caltech has a disproportionate influence on anything. What you should have been talking about are the number of MIT math majors vs. the number of Harvard math majors vs. the number of Caltech math majors. What does it matter if Harvard graduates hundreds and hundreds of English and Psychology majors? What does that have to do with who has a more disproportionate influence on math?<br><br>Furthermore, do you really think that Caltech has such a disproportionate degree of influence on graduate-school admission? Then look at Caltech's own graduate departments (the ones that actually admit Caltech undergrads) and I think you would concede that there probably ought to be more former Caltech undergrads. After all, it would be 'homefield advantage' coupled with the fact that nobody really likes to move, and so Caltech undergrads would probably feel highly comfortable at Caltech graduate school. Yet Caltech graduate school seems to admit plenty of HYPSM students. I am not aware of any evidence that Caltech undergrads enjoy any serious leg up on HYPSM students when it comes to Caltech graduate admissions.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CWatson42</b><br><br>I'd also like to add that of all the people I have seen posting on these forums, Ben Golub is one of the most well-spoken, patient, and respectable, so please don't sink to personal attacks--that's not what these forums are for.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>sakky -- I don't know your background, but there is a general ethos at most places that it's not great to stay where you went for undergrad. Contrary to your unfounded assertion that \"nobody really likes to move\" most people in their early 20s would love to see new places and meet new people. Have you been around college seniors recently?<br><br>Personally, I love Caltech, but four years here will be enough. Then it'll be time to go elsewhere and enjoy the fruits of the rigorous training.<br><br>Oh, by the way, MIT and Harvard and Princeton all have way more math majors per year than Caltech.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>CWatson -- good post (first one) and thanks a bunch (second one). See you next year :-)<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>Now, let me say the following. I'd like to think I'm a fair guy, so I would point out that Caltech's graduation rate today is far better than it was in the past. An 89% graduation rate in 6 years is actually really really good for Caltech, relative to what used to happen in the past.<br><br>But that just goes to illustrate one of the points I have been making. I think we can all agree that Caltech is still extremely rigorous today, despite the fact that far more Caltech undergrads actually manage to graduate today than, say, a generation ago. Hence, that serves to bolster what I've been saying - you can in fact boost your graduation rate while still maintaining rigor. They are not mutually exclusive.<br><br>The issue is not that Caltech hasn't made substantial progress on this front. It has indeed. But I believe there is still more that can be done. I believe the real problem is a cultural belief that rigor necessarily means a lower graduation rate, which I don't believe is the case. You can have both rigor and a high graduation rate. Is it easy to combine both? Of course not. But Caltech is an elite school, and elite schools are supposed to be able to do things that aren't easy.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>sakky -- you do seem to be a fair guy, and we agree more than we disagree. But I want to point out that going against the grain and not signing up for the popular fad of maximizing yields and graduation rates is not necessarily evidence of institutional arrogance.<br><br>Sometimes the popular thing to do is the right thing, and at other times the right thing to do is to go against the grain. I think this case falls into the latter category, but you are free to disagree.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>Ben Golub, do you really think that people really like moving around, after they graduate from undergrad?<br><br>Then why is it that far and away the most popular grad-school destination for MIT undergrads is...

I guess these MIT people don't really want to move around.<br><br><url>http://web.mit.edu/facts/graduation.shtml</url><br><br>Furthermore, the largest chunk of Harvard Law Students came from ... Harvard College. The largest chunk of Harvard Medical Students came from ...Harvard College. Similarly, the largest chunk of Stanford graduate students did their undergrad at either Stanford or Berkeley (only 40 minutes away). Not a whole lot of moving around going on there.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>Keep in mind Stanford and Berkeley are cities compared to Caltech, size-wise. While a cozy place is great for undergrads, many of us would like another sort of environment for grad school. I don't think how many Caltech undergrads stay for grad school is a great metric. If you could get your hands on data saying how many of those who APPLIED got in, that would be a different and more interesting story.<br><br>", "<b>Username: itsallgood</b><br><br>Wow, that's an eye-opener. Illinois Urban beats CalTech too.<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Makes you wonder is CalTech is the elite school it makes out to be.<br><br>Maybe it's just a very small, good school, and that makes it seem elite.<br><br>", "<b>Username: itsallgood</b><br><br>Ben, have you been forthright with everyone about the smog in Pasadena area. Or would you even know? C'mon, are you really a CalTech student?<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>... a **** (webhappy thus honored you in another thread)<br><br>For a while there you were occasionally saying some things at least worth refuting, but now you're just wasting my time. I wish you all the happiness in the world at Georgia Tech.<br><br>I am off to do my real analysis homework, which is harder here than at other places ;-)<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>The point was to simply say that a lot of people clearly don't like to move around too much, for whatever reason that might be.<br><br>The other point is that clearly HYPSM are highly respected programs, for if they were not, then the Caltech graduate programs would be stupid for admitting as many HYPSM graduates as they do. And I think we can all agree that the Caltech graduate programs are not stupid. Hence, people can laugh and poke fun at the high grade inflation at HYPS all they want, but at the end of the day, a good number of HYPS students manage to get into Caltech graduate programs. So that grade inflation obviously didn't hurt them too badly.<br><br>However, what I am seeing is that Caltech seems to be playing a double game. On the one hand, Caltech decries the trend of higher yields and higher graduation rates, saying that it is a possible threat to rigor. On the other hand, Caltech has (quietly and not without resistance) in fact, boosted its graduation rate. I have noticed that the Caltech graduation rate is substantially higher than it was just a few years ago.<br><br>I still don't see why it is really so controversial for Caltech to boost its graduation rate with the simple step of admitting less students, and in particular, not admitting those borderline students. Why is that such a terrible thing? Caltech knows full well who these borderline students are, or could fairly easily find out. For example, Caltech could go back to its historical data of each admitted class, categorize and rank them in deciles, and then look at the graduation rate of each decile. Or some other more involved statistical analysis. From that, find out which attributes serve as 'warning flags', and simply admit less future candidates that have lots of these warning flags.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>sakky -- as I explained before: I do admissions, and we do all these things. It's just completely false to say that \"Caltech knows full well who these borderline students are, or could fairly easily find out.\" You can't guarantee 99% graduation rates at Caltech except by seeing the future or changing the actual education. Plus, a lot of the kids who did great at great high schools end up not doing so well here (complacency or something). It's a complicated question. If you think you can do a better job than admissions does, come and do so.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>I thought you were off to do your analysis homework.<br><br>It is obviously true that admissions is not an exact science and that you can never know with 100% certainty who is going to succeed and who isn't.<br><br>But just because it's not an exact science doesn't mean that you can't make good predictions. For example, you can take any entering class and figure out with fairly strong certitude who among that class will probably end up doing better than others. No guarantees, of course, but the likelihood is there. The guy with straight perfects on all standardized test scores, who is valedictorian with straight A's, and who won all kinds of math and science awards, and has mind-shattering rec's and essays will probably do better than the guy who got less than perfect test scores, who wasn't valedictorian, and who has less awards and whose recs/essays are not that good, even though both applicants got accepted.<br><br>On a larger scale, you simply take all the admittees from years past, put it into a computer running statistical software like JMP or Minitab (or heck, get some of the Caltech CS students to write a custom program), and basically run a large-scale regression using Design of Experiments techniques, to determine which attribute is statistically significant. Then you do the same for several other classes of years past as a check and to make your data more significant. Eventually you will be able to flag certain attributes as truly significant. It really is no different from the data-mining techniques that all large companies use to ascertain which customers are likely to buy which products.<br><br>The point is, that every single admitted class has some students who just barely got in. If 400 spots were handed out, somebody came in as #400. Maybe you can't figure out exactly who is #400 (i.e. everybody between #351-400 looks basically the same), but you can divide out to some degree who is a very strong candidate in a given admitted class, and who is a less strong candidate in that same admitted class to at least some level of resolution. Then, Caltech can simply admit fewer students in that less-strong category. You can use the statistical results of the software to help you determine who is in that less-strong category.<br><br>You're not going to get all of the students who won't graduate, but you will get a good number of them. And, true, you will probably end up tossing out some students who could have graduated. But I wouldn't worry too much for them. Like I said, if you can get into Caltech, then you should be able to get into at least 1 of HYPSM.<br><br>", "<b>Username: itsallgood</b><br><br>If CalTech is tied with USC for Grad School Engineering, does that make USC an elite school.<br><br>Is Georgia Tech more elite.<br><br>Is Illinois Urbana elite.<br><br>Wow, what does that make MIT and Stanford.<br><br>", "<b>Username: djcapelis</b><br><br>I know that it may be generous to call me even borderline for Caltech, but I expect to thrive if I get in.

As such, the country has an obligation to protect what they're giving as well as possible, in the hope that they don't have to make the ultimate sacrifice. As for college, Caltech doesn't need me. There are many more people out there that could probably do better here than I am, and give more back to the school than I have. It is a privledge for me to be here, and I don't think Caltech has an obligation to shepard me through and make sure I survive. Quite the contrary -- I like that I'm being challenged to my fullest. I like that it's not a given that I'll graduate with honors. I revel in the fact that Caltech has given me an environment where I can work hard to be mediocre.

Do Caltech graduates really enjoy substantially greater access to graduate school and/or employers than do HYPSM graduates?

I wanted to make sure that I went to the school that would give me an education best suited to my needs. If you don't go to the school which is going to give you the best education, the brand-name is not much more than an empty label. It's hilarious to me how hung up everyone is on which school is \"better\". In my opinion, the school itself is not nearly as important as the interplay between the student and the school. The student needs to choose the school that's going to help him/her the most in acheiving a good education. When did choosing a college start being about choosing a brand-name?<br><br>As for grad schools, it's incredibly unreliable. Some departments won't admit Caltech undergrads. In many, the grads take many of the same courses as an undergrad, so going elsewhere will give students a broader range of new courses to choose between. Those HYPSM students who come in and \"do just fine\" in the physics program, for example, often have to start with the same classes that Caltech undergrad JUNIORS take. All of my CS courses are half grad, half undergrad, and if I stayed here for grad school, I'd run out of courses to take. There are so many factors that go into a student deciding whether to stay or not that it's really not worth comparing. Also, where you want to go to grad school really should not factor into your search for an undergrad school. For instance, I considered not coming to Caltech as an undergrad so that I could do grad here. Now I know that Caltech doesn't have the branch of CS I'm interested in, so I wouldn't have wanted to come here for grad school anyways. If I'd declined Caltech so that I could come here for grad, I would have missed out.<br>\"\"You have also displayed a rather strong sense of, well, let me be frank - institutional arrogance (note, I am not saying that you are personally arrogant, but rather I am calling Caltech as possibly being arrogant).

It is a privledge for me to be here, and I don't think Caltech has an obligation to shepard me through and make sure I survive. Quite the contrary -- I like that I'm being challenged to my fullest. I like that it's not a given that I'll graduate with honors. I revel in the fact that Caltech has given me an environment where I can work hard to be mediocre. That's what I want, and I knew it coming in. Yes, I do think the students who leave made a bad choice. We all make bad choices every once in a while. It's nothing to be ashamed of or looked down on.\"\"<br><br>First of all, I think it's an entirely fair analogy when placed in the context of what Ben Golub said. Basically, to paraphrase what Ben Golub said is that Caltech is rigorous and if people don't like it, then they shouldn't come to Caltech, and by I think by reasonable implication, I can surmise that if people come to Caltech and do badly, then according to Ben Golub, that's their own stupid fault for choosing Caltech, and they have nobody to blame for that but themselves. I am pointing out that that's a tremendously cold way to go about providing an education. We're not talking about a bunch of scrub underachievers here, we're talking about some of the best students in the world, and to say that Caltech holds no responsibility at all if they do badly is quite off-putting. If that's what you think Caltech should do, that's your opinion. It is, however, my opinion that every school has a responsibility to ensure that whoever comes to the school is provided with every opportunity to succeed, and if you don't want to provide such an opportunity to certain people, then fine, don't admit them in the first place. It's far better to not admit certain students than to bring in some students only to watch them flail around and fail.<br><br>You also talk about making bad choices. and whether people should feel bad about them. The question is not whether people should personally feel bad about making certain choices, but about the stigma that society places. Let's face it. Right or wrong, society considers it to be shameful to be tagged as a 'college flunkie'. Right or wrong, society considers it to be highly desirable to have a college degree than not. You can look at how many jobs are out there that require a college degree, even if the job itself has nothing to do with anything that one would learn in college. Right or wrong, society makes a big distinction between somebody who has a college degree, and somebody who doesn't. Yes, we can talk about certain rare exceptions like Bill Gates, but by and large, unless you intend to start your own company, it is important to have a college degree, if for no other reason, than because it helps you to get a job. Hence, by and large, you are better off going to a no-name school and graduating, then going to a top-flight school, and flunking out. If you are good enough to get into Caltech, then you are clearly good enough to get into many other colleges. And the greater guarantee of a degree from somewhere else is something that people should consider carefully.<br><br>The flip side of that is that Caltech could better itself by offering a greater probability that those who come in will actually leave with a degree. This could be achieved by not bringing in borderline cases in the first place.<br><br>[I also don't think leaving Caltech is the disaster you make it out to be. I also know the girl Ben mentioned who transferred to Duke, I knew a guy who transferred to Berkley, and I know another that I think is planning to transfer to Stanford. Many of these people did not have stellar GPA's.]<br><br>I never said it was a disaster, and in fact, I give kudos to Caltech for being a lot better than most other schools.<br><br>But that's not the point. I'm sure you would agree that people who flunk out or get put on academic probation would have great difficulty in going to another top-flight school. And even that misses the greater point. Those people you cited who are trying to transfer to Berkeley or Stanford, you must agree, would have been better off if they had simply gone to Berkeley or Stanford as incoming freshman.<br><br>The point is that anytime any school (not just Caltech, but any school) brings in a student who, for whatever reason, doesn't graduate, that's a problem. It is of course true that no school will graduate 100% of its students. But that doesn't mean that you simply don't try. And in particular, Caltech graduates less of its students than its peer institutions (HYPSM). I believe Caltech should look at why that is the case and whether they can do something about it.<br><br>We're talking about flesh-and-blood human beings here who have feelings and have futures. If somebody comes to Caltech and for whatever reason decides it is not right for them, then that's a flesh-and-blood problem.<br>\"\"Maybe I'm alone in this, but I was very careful NOT to choose a school based on brand-name appeal. I wanted to make sure that I went to the school that would give me an education best suited to my needs.\"\"<br><br>And here, alleya, I think you have implicitly conceded the problem. You might not chosen a school based on whether that school would give you an education best suited to your needs. Fine. Fair enough. But clearly, judging from the Caltech graduation rate, quite a few people did not do that. Quite a few people came to Caltech even though it was not going to give them an education that was best suited for their needs (for if they did, then why wouldn't they be graduating?).<br>\"\"Maybe so, but there has been a demand for this kind of education for over a hundered years, and as long as there are still students who continue to flood us with applications, I don't see why it's so horrible to keep doing things the way we are. Wouldn't it be better to have many different types of college education out there, rather than half a dozen schools with no differences whatsoever? Who's to say HYPSM are doing it \"better\"? Why not just say they're doing it differently?\"\"<br><br>Well, to follow this logic, every highly-demanded school will never have to make anything better. For example, when I point out problems at Berkeley (which I often do), then Berkeley can argue \"Well, lots and lots of people apply to Berkeley, so clearly there is a demand, so that means that we never have to fix any of our problems ever. Why should we care about making things better if there is demand for us?\".<br><br>The issue is not whether Caltech is being horrible. It's about making Caltech better. I am not saying that HYPSM do everything better. However, what I would say is that I doubt that anybody at Caltech would point to its graduation rate vis-a-vis HYPSM and say that they are 'proud' of it. Nobody is 'proud' of having a lower graduation rate than its peers.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>\"\"Sakky,<br><br>It may be easier to enter MIT grad schools from Caltech than from MIT undergrad school itself. Most of my Caltech friends *who applied* to MIT grad school are accepted.(Normally Caltech students would know whether he/she would be accepted or not prior to submitting his/her application). The number of Caltech grads who get into MIT grad schools (by percentage) are perhaps larger than MIT grads themselves and obviously larger than Stanford or Cornell or Princeton, etc.\"\"<br><br>I believe this is an unsupported assertion, and in any case, I would like to see the numbers that support this assertion. I would argue that those Caltech students who apply to MIT graduate school are clearly a highly self-selective group and so it wouldn't surprise me if lots of students within that highly self-selective group got in. That doesn't tell me anything about people from Caltech who would have wanted to go to MIT for graduate school but don't apply because they suspect they can't get in (either because their grades aren't good enough, or whatever).<br><br>Furthermore, it especially doesn't tell me anything about those people who come to Caltech intending to go to MIT for graduate school, but then don't even manage to graduate from Caltech, either because they transfer elsewhere or because they simply flunk out completely. And that's the real crux of what I've been saying. I have always maintained that Caltech is really really good for those students who can handle it. But what about those who can't? Those students are people too, and it doesn't seem fair to simply ignore them out of hand.<br><br>[On the average yes, employers look very highly on Caltech because it's purely meritrocracy, i.e. if you brilliant you're in, if not then you're out. There's no bargaining with non-academic EC like in Stanford for admission. The common exception for my claim is MIT]<br><br>I'm afraid that this is a bit of a non-sequitur. As horrible as it is to say, merit and employment are not as tightly coupled as many people think. Surely we've all heard the phrase \"It's not what you know, it's who you know\". Right or wrong, many jobs are given out for reasons that don't have a whole lot to do with merit. Things like contacts, networking, and brand-name come into play. Stanford people hire lots of other Stanford people because of the Stanford connection. Same thing with Harvard people. The other aspect of the 'game' is that employers might hire somebody from an extremely famous school (like Harvard or Stanford) even if they think that another candidate is probably better, simply because they know that the Harvard or Stanford brand-name is better for attracting clients. I-banks and consulting companies are notorious for doing that - they want to be able to show to customers that they have a Harvard or Stanford guy. Again, like it or not, Caltech doesn't have the brand-name appeal that Harvard or Stanford does. Even if it is in a bullshi* major, the fact that it has a brand-name school behind it gives it customer desirability.<br><br>Look, I don't want this to turn into an emotional argument. Caltech is an elite school, I never said otherwise. What I am saying is that from a pure marketing standpoint, Caltech has a weakness when it comes to its graduation rate. Certain brilliant students who might otherwise have gone to Caltech might be off-put by its lower-than-its-peers graduation rate, and end up Harvard or Stanford (or even MIT) for its greater assurance of graduation. And I think it's a tremendously dangerous thing to simply back-handedly dismiss these students as 'not tough enough' or 'not worthy enough' to attend Caltech. Many of these students could have done just fine at Caltech, it's just that they prefer the greater assurance of graduation elsewhere. So the question is, does Caltech want to compete for these students or not? I believe that if Caltech really wants to be the best tech school in the land, it will have to compete for the best tech students, including those tech students who desire that high assurance of graduation. It is not an irrational or \"wimpy\" thing to want a high assurance of graduation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rtkysg</b><br><br>LOL! Sakky, I think you've mis-interpreted some of my comments about employment. When I said recruiters looked very highly on Caltech students, it didn't necessarily translate to easy employment.

After my freshman year I seriously considered transferring elsewhere, but in the end I decided to stay. I have often thought about whether I made the right decision. Anyway, here's my thinking about this school. I'm writing this epinion as if to a high school student thinking of where to go to college.<br><br>Standards are really high at Caltech. About half of my class got the highest possible score on their SATs (1600 points). My total of math and verbal was 1579 which I still remember because this is the kind of place where such things are actually topics of discussion! I think almost every student got an 800 on the math part, it's only the verbal that was different. (This probably explains my lousy grammar.) It is really a pleasure to be with so many smart people who understand what you're talking about, who can follow a line of thought, and who have interesting things to say.<br><br>The teachers I had were outstanding. A number had either won a Nobel Prize or would later win one. I am tempted to drop names, but let's leave it at that. Sure the courses are challenging but if you are a good student, you love to study and learn new things, and so it's a pleasure, really. Students are treated well here. The administration is well organized. The student house system works well, especially for the many studious loners who would be isolated if housed in a regular dorm. The small student body and the small campus are nice and homey and you get a real feeling of belonging here. The narrow focus of the school is something to consider: if you want to be a scientist in one of the traditional hard sciences like physics, chemistry or biology, this is the place. For other things, like computer science or most engineering, it's only so-so. For other topics than science and engineering, the choice of courses is terribly narrow. I remember marveling over a UCLA catalog which offered a tremendous rainbow of things to study.<br><br>My feeling now, thirty years after graduation, is that college is a time of transition from being under your parent's roof to being a totally independent adult. The best thing a college can do is prepare you for success as an adult. And I'm not sure Caltech does the best job of that. First off, the social life is bad. Only about 30% of the students are women and that makes for a lot of lonely and sad guys. Secondly, it's such an ivory tower. The \"Honor System\" is an example of that. I think many students are attracted to the life of a scientist because it sounds like a noble calling - seeking truth and bettering humanity. The real world comes as a surprise. Grad students everywhere (not just Caltech) are treated like slave labor, helping their advisor to succeed and working for peanuts, with the time for their PhD dragged out for a shocking number of years. Then when they do get that PhD (the scientist's union card) they wind up in post-doc hell, trying to get on a tenure track or trying to get grants of their own, but mostly teaching for peanuts or doing the grunt work for someone else's research. Many finally give up and turn to other work, like computer programming. If I sound bitter, let me add that this is not my story. I was always interested in computers and went straight from Caltech into software development. But I have seen what happens to others.<br><br>I visited a number of times as a recruiter. A few students were fantastic - sharp and energetic, really kept me on my toes. But all too many were clueless dreamers. They were still learning computer languages like Pascal and Ada and LISP that time has passed by.<br><br>I think a better choice would be a larger and more diverse school with very high standards. For computer science, the best schools are Stanford, MIT and (a sleeper) the University of Waterloo in Canada.

The observations put forth here come from what my dad described as 5 to 10 minute informal phone conversations with people who were involved in interviewing and hiring engineers into their companies or departments.

In fact many not so technical companies are driven away from Caltech, nevertheless it still commands highest respect (arguably slightly higher than Stanford) in terms of pure academic achievement.\"\"<br><br>Well, first of all, you are at least partially conceding something there. The fact is, a lot of people do indeed see the value of going to an elite college as getting easy (or at least easier) employment. And I think this is particularly true of many middle-class parents who get little financial aid, and who figure that if they have to fork over an arm and a leg for a private college, then they better be arming their progeny with the best chance of getting a job as easily as possible, otherwise might as well just send their kid to a public university. The point is, I don't think it's proper for us to dismiss any concerns of 'employability' as being somehow quaint or unworthy. A lot of people worry about how marketable their degree will be to all employers, not just highly technical employers, and rightfully so.<br><br>Now, again, to be fair, I am not saying that the Caltech degree is unmarketable. On the contrary - it is in fact one of the most marketable degrees on the face of the planet. What we are talking about is its marketability relative to its peer institutions. And in particular, we should be talking about marketability, keeping the major constant (hence, it's not fair to compare electrical engineers to English majors).<br><br>However, we still have at hand the true issue at hand. I have said it before and I will say it again - those students who are doing well at and who are enjoying Caltech are obviously benefitting from Caltech immensely. But I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about those Caltech students who don't do well at all. The fact is, there are a not-insignificant number of students at Caltech who are not doing well. And my central point is - what about them? At Harvard, or even at MIT, even those students who are not doing well are still more likely to graduate than those students at Caltech who are not doing well.<br><br>And the response and attitude that I have gotten is that \"Well, if they're not doing well, that's too bad, they were stupid for choosing Caltech, and so they deserve what they get\". I think that's a rather callous and cold attitude to have. I believe a school needs to look after ALL its students, not just those who are doing well. Caltech is indeed doing a pretty good job in this aspect (i.e. far better than Berkeley is, which hardly ), but still could stand for some improvement in this area.<br><br>And the other main point I've been making is that the relatively low graduation rate at Caltech (relative to HYPSM) does in fact scare some people off who otherwise would probably have done quite well at Caltech. Let's face it. Fear of not-graduating is a legitimate concern. Just because you're afraid of not graduating doesn't mean that you are an intellectual wuss or otherwise unworthy of Caltech. You don't just go to college because it's fun to go to college, you go there because you want to graduate, and so everybody should be concerned about whether they will graduate.<br><br>Nor is a low graduation rate necessary to prove that your school is 'rigorous'. You can have both rigor and high graduation rates. Elite medical schools like Johns Hopkins Medical are highly rigorous, yet they manage to graduate almost every student. Hence, that proves it is possible to have both. Is it difficult? Sure. But Caltech is an elite school, so Caltech should be able to do difficult things. After all, Caltech students are asked to complete extremely difficult assignments and exams all the time. So why can't the Caltech administration be asked to do something difficult?<br><br>", "<b>Username: rtkysg</b><br><br>Sakky,<br><br>Frankly speaking, beyond a certain threshold I believe it is really hard to measure the probability of an admit dropping out from Caltech. Again, the drop-out students' profiles may have large variance, although I and you will both never know the real statistics. Despite Ben's 'harsh' opinion, I would think that Caltech adcom has tried rigorously to select the qualified students. It does not make sense to admit students who have high probability to drop out. After all it doesn't bring good image to the university, and hence I would argue your claim that Caltech purposely makes such a scheme to prove its rigor. It's just a lame and childish perception don't you think? You keep pushing your view that the Caltech adcom should be able to better filter its students, but without statistical data, how would you argue that Caltech adcom has not reasonably done its homework before admitting a student?<br><br>Of course there is always another way to boost graduation rate, such as giving less workload and grade inflation as practiced in Stanford. However, it turns out to violate the school's core policy and hence not implementable in this case.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rockyNo1</b><br><br>hey guys, i hear it is difficultto transfer to MIT. Is it as difficult or even more to transfer to Caltech?<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>Rtkysg, well I don't know, but it does seem to me that from what Ben Golub has been saying, that Caltech does in fact see its relatively high dropout rate as a symbol that it is a difficult school. The thinking seems to be \"Well, we are an extremely difficult school and we'll prove it by causing a lot of our students to drop out.\" I believe the philosophy is that it provides a psychological and cultural boost to the Caltech alumni who obviously didn't drop out, because they can say that not only did they get into Caltech, they also managed to survive it, so that makes them even more special.<br><br>Furthermore, I would argue that it is in fact highly possible to fit your students better. This is precisely what medical school adcoms do. I think we would all agree that Johns Hopkins Medical School is ridiculously rigorous. Yet very very few students drop out. Yes, I know what you're going to say - we're not talking about med-school. But the point is that there is a model out there for how a school can be both highly rigorous and yet have very few students drop out. It is possible to do both. It will require dedication and hard work from the Caltech adcom staff. Yet I don't think that's too much to ask. After all, Caltech profs ask their students to do extremely difficult coursework every day. So why can't we ask the Caltech adcom staff to do something difficult?<br><br>", "<b>Username: omgninja</b><br><br>Sakky, I would like to point out that no matter what committees Ben is on, his opinions are still his own.<br><br><br>The homework here is doable, but it's still work. Completion of the homework requires the student's effort. Attendance at lecture, section, and office hours as well as giving homework a large chunk of one's free time may be necessary. Most people will need to really love what they're doing in order to succeed here.<br><br>From what I heard at an information meeting when I was looking at Caltech, it seems that the admissions committee selects students based on several criteria:<br><br>1) The student has talent.<br>2) The student has passion for math/science/whatever.<br><br>I would imagine that in as competitive an admissions atmosphere as the one present now there would be the occasional student who out of insecurity would overplay their passion for math/science/whatever. I seriously doubt that anyone would purposely choose to admit someone with the intent of having them drop out. However, admissions committees know only what applicants and teachers tell them in the application*, recommendations, and transcript, and in the event that someone misrepresents themself on their application, I believe that it is entirely their fault if they do happen to drop out in this case.<br><br><br>Arguments calling for the admissions committee to better filter applicants would not benefit student life. Given that the number admitted is around 225 (wait-listed students were also admitted), I think that to cut down on the number of admitted students any more would simply limit this school. We would be given fewer options in terms of humanities and social sciences, which is not a good thing. Sports teams would be in a tough spot, as our teams are already tiny compared to other schools in our athletic conference. Although any housing shortages would be alleviated, and Caltech's small size is definitely an asset, I sincerely doubt that anything good can come from further decreasing the size of the freshman class.<br><br>In the event that there are fewer than 225 individuals capable of graduation in the freshman class, I believe that it is still in the student body's best interest to be given the 4-8%** or so who drop out due to dissatisfaction with Caltech; these 9-18 students will without a doubt benefit and learn from their peers and classes while they are here, and no one is forcing these students to take the opportunity to study here. In fact, at prefrosh weekend orientation last spring, Dean Revel explicitly stated that the idea of prefrosh weekend was not to sell the school to a student but to determine whether or not Caltech is a good fit for the student, a theme apparent throughout the weekend. On top of this, since there were 240 prefrosh in attendance, he specifically asked that some of us not matriculate since our desired class size is less than the number of us that were in attendance. In addition to these statements, the overall tone of Caltech's admissions publications do not seem to be \"pushing\" the school on the prospective applicant as much as they are presenting it.<br>\"\"First of all, I think it's an entirely fair analogy when placed in the context of what Ben Golub said. Basically, to paraphrase what Ben Golub said is that Caltech is rigorous and if people don't like it, then they shouldn't come to Caltech, and by I think by reasonable implication, I can surmise that if people come to Caltech and do badly, then according to Ben Golub, that's their own stupid fault for choosing Caltech, and they have nobody to blame for that but themselves. I am pointing out that that's a tremendously cold way to go about providing an education. We're not talking about a bunch of scrub underachievers here, we're talking about some of the best students in the world, and to say that Caltech holds no responsibility at all if they do badly is quite off-putting.\"\"<br><br>For those students who drop out of Caltech after matriculation due to grades, despite the fact that tutoring is available through the Dean's Office (free for classes in the core curriculum), I think it's unfair to say that they were not warned. The informed applicant has no excuse not to know that Caltech has \"one of the most demanding core curricula in the nation\" ( <url>http://admissions.caltech.edu/only/unique/</url> ), and for those \"uninformed applicants,\" it is definitely \"their own stupid fault\" for choosing a college too difficult for them as choice of a college is definitely an important decision, and taking this decision lightly is definitely not a wise thing to do.<br><br>*I will disregard interviews because, as someone mentioned earlier, they give a disproportionate advantage to extroverted students. Although someone made an argument that a shy student may perk up and speak excitedly about something they love, often this is not the case as some people are simply inarticulate. It is probably easier to teach someone how to convey ideas than it is to teach someone to be brilliant, so I'd imagine that Caltech would place smarter students over more articulate ones. There are in fact classes (required by the core curriculum \"Science Communications\" requirement) in which students learn to better express their ideas.<br><br>**I say 4-8% despite the fact that our six-year graduation rate is 88% because more than 2% of the people in my house were freshman over 6 years ago and given Stanford's, Yale's and Harvard's 6-year graduation rates of 93-96%, MIT's 6 year graduation rate of 92%, and ignoring UC Berkeley's 4-year graduation rate of 53%, I think it's fair to say that a certain percentage of people anywhere will not finish college in 6 years. Graduation rate data obtained from princetonreview.com.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>Well said, ninja.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>First of all, I would point out that while it is of course true that Ben Golub's opinions are his own, my opinions are also my own. I respect his right to his opinions, yet I believe that everybody should respect my right to my opinions.<br><br>Now, let me say this. Omgninja, I'm afraid to say it, but it seems to me that you are displaying the precise sort of mentality that I've been talking about - that the only person who deserves blame for bad academic performance are the students themselves, and the school bears no responsibility whatsoever. I find that pretty cold.<br><br>Let me explain. It looks like you are pinning poor performance solely on a bad fit, or, even worse, just on misrepresentation, as if everybody who flunks out of Caltech must have misrepresented themselves to the adcom and therefore to flunk out. That's pretty harsh, don't you think? The fact is, there are plenty of reasons why one would have academic difficulty. Even those students who fit the school like a glove may have academic difficulty. Some people simply have problems adjusting to life away from home, and so they would have homesickness wherever they went to school. Some people go through a horrifically bad romantic breakup. There are plenty of reasons why a person would be a perfect fit for Caltech, yet still do poorly.<br><br>Yet the point is, Caltech doesn't seem to care about that, and not to put words in you and Ben Golub's mouth, you guys don't seem to care about that either. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that for those people who go through those sorts of things, you are saying, oh well, that that's simply too bad for them, and if they can't pull themselves together, that's their own fault, and Caltech bears no responsibility to help them out.<br><br>I am asserting that that's exactly the sort of image and mentality that scares some otherwise highly qualified students off. You say that people should be able to assess whether they are a good fit for Caltech, and if they aren't then they should come, but come on, how are people really supposed to figure out whether with certainty whether they are a good fit or not? And even if they are a good fit, what assurance is there that something won't happen during their 4 years that will cause their performance to plummet? No such assurance can be provided in either case. Yet you are basically saying that if you screw up, it's your own fault, and Caltech has no obligation to help you out. Hence, I believe that many otherwise perfectly qualified students, upon hearing that message, will simply choose to go elsewhere. We're not talking about peanuts here, we're talking about whether you are going to get your degree or not. That's a big deal.<br><br>And I take it back to what was said previously in this thread. It's not like Caltech is perceived as being worlds-away better than HYPSM. If Caltech really was considered to be heads-and-shoulders above every other school, including HYPSM, then you might be able to make a case that Caltech's difficulty is worth it. But it's isn't. Caltech graduates are generally not viewed as worlds-away better than HYPSM graduates. Maybe a little bit better (and even that's debateable), but certainly not worlds-away better. I've met plenty of Caltech graduates, and they're obviously good, but they're not clearly 'way above' the HYPSM graduates. Hence, a lot of people simply see Caltech as being a bad choice of risk-versus-reward.<br><br>Consider Caltech's yield rate, especially head-to-head against HYPSM. Caltech often times loses students to HYPSM. Many of those students that are lost could have done very well at Caltech, but just chose not to take the risk. Nor is that an invalid reason or does that make that person somehow 'unworthy'. Safety is something that people value. If I choose to live in a safer neighborhood rather than a dangerous one, that doesn't make me a 'wuss'. It just means I value my personal safety and I don't want to get jumped at night. Similarly, if somebody chooses another school over Caltech because they want 'graduation safety', that doesn't make them weak or cowardly, it just means that they view Caltech as a bit risky. I am proposing that if Caltech were to decrease its risk portfolio, it would be able to get even better students.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>sakky, omgninja just meant that my opinions don't necessarily agree with those of the committee -- I'm just a guy on a message board.<br><br>As for the fact that we lose some people to HYPSM because they prefer a safer school, that's true. Caltech is, for the average student, more expensive in a certain sense -- it comes at the cost of a higher risk -- than HYPSM. This is why our yield is lower.<br><br>The first delusion you have to shed: we are not out to maximize our yield. Other schools might be, but we aren't. We explicitly tell students that some of them are ill-suited to this place. Why you think that all schools should maximize yield is a complete mystery to me (and you, too, will soon see how misguided that is). So every time you say \"you could get more of those kids\" as if that should convince us, don't bother. We don't want every potential student to come here, just the ones that are well-suited to this environment.<br><br>Lots of things that have high (opportunity) costs have low yields. Very few people who could in theory afford a Rolex watch actually buy one. The yield -- the ratio of actual buyers relative to potential buyers -- is low. That's not a flaw of Rolex watches. It's just a fact about life. Only the people who value a Rolex watch above a certain amount of money buy it.<br><br>The people who choose Caltech despite the fact that it is more expensive (in terms of risk) are like people who choose a Rolex despite its high price (in money). Both groups value the product above the price. Your blithering about how Caltech degrees are not far and away better is irrelevant (just like your opinion about whether a Rolex watch is \"worth\" that much money). What matters to the people making the choice is not some metric you choose (how respected the diploma is, for instance) but what they value in a school -- the environment, the rigor, the classmates, etc. This is a major amateur mistake made by people who haven't taken an intro econ class or didn't understand it. You don't determine the value of goods to people. They do, and it's whatever they say it is. The values aren't objective. There's nothing irrational about choosing a higher cost product if it's worth it to you.<br><br>Once again you see that by reducing the price (the risk) of Caltech, we could attract more buyers. If a Rolex cost $50 (which would be feasible, by the way), a lot more people would buy Rolexes. This is a trivial point. It doesn't mean the price should be reduced. (In the case of both Caltech and Rolex, the relevant cost is a large part of what makes the good attractive in the first place to its buyers.)<br><br>Let's take another example -- extreme skiing vacations. These have high costs associated with them (above and beyond the sticker price that you pay in money) because of the risks inherent in extreme skiing. As with Rolex watches, very few of the potential buyers become actual buyers of extreme skiing vacations. This is because the costs of the vacation (mostly risk costs) for most people are not offset by the value they would get out of it.<br><br>Converting extreme ski resorts to average-difficulty slopes would cause the yield to skyrocket -- all sorts of potential buyers who didn't even consider a resort before would ski there, and the loss in \"extreme\" skiers would be decidedly negligible compared to the gain in average skiers. But this does not mean that the conversion should take place. For many reasons, it's good to have some extreme skiing resorts. For some people, the fact that it's risky is part of the value.<br><br>Oh, and by the way, extreme ski resorts lose out *massively* head-to-head to even fairly challenging mainstream ski resorts. This doesn't imply that they're \"worse\", whatever that means.<br><br>But you're like a person arguing that if you only placed padded foam on both sides of the steeper slopes, it would be attractive to so many more people. You don't understand that attracting more people isn't the point. Not all business (or all colleges) are designed to be high-yield enterprises. Disneyland is, extreme ski resorts aren't. Wal-Mart is, Rolex isn't. McDonald's is, the Four Seasons isn't.<br><br>So your main point (about how higher costs mean lower yield) is trivial. It's clear to a horse. It's not interesting. It's not new to us. And it's not a reason to change the costs. You should first go talk to Rolex and extreme skiing resorts and encourage them to make their product lower cost, to make it higher yield.<br><br>As for Hopkins med school being hard but having a high graduation rate, you have to realize that they have the luxury of much better data on which to screen. College grades at good undergraduate institutions are a much stronger predictor of medical school grades than high school grades and scores are of college grades. Not to mention that people's interests and abilities are more solidified at 22 than 18. So you're comparing apples to oranges in an uninteresting and illegitimate way.<br><br>Finally, your accusation that Caltech is cold and uncaring is nonsense. We have free psychological counseling, free tutoring in core classes, a strong undergraduate peer support network, and many many other ways to make Caltech manageable. This is akin to an extreme ski resort having good medical services, checking for unintended hazards on the mountain, and offering detailed tours of the slopes. They're doing everything they can to make the enterprise safe SHORT OF ruining the point of the enterprise in the first place, which is to offer a more challenging skiing environment than most, WITH MORE FEAR OF FAILURE! (Ask any extreme skier, that's what makes it worth it.) Similarly, we at Caltech are doing everything we can to make this education safe SHORT OF ruining the point of this enterprise in the first place, which is to offer a more challenging college environment than almost any other, WITH MORE FEAR OF FAILURE. (That's what makes it worth it for us, too, as alleya has pointed out.)<br><br>And remember, you can't now say that the extra risks of Caltech aren't \"worth it\" -- that not enough value is added to offset those costs. Maybe not for you. Certainly extreme skiing doesn't add enough value for me to offset its risk costs. But I'm not arguing that the resorts should be made more failure-proof. Obviously they're valuable for some people.<br><br>As far as I can tell, this takes care of all the persistent nonsense you have been spewing. Yes, Caltech has higher risk costs. Yes, this reduces yield. No, this is not a problem, any more than extreme ski resorts having low yields is a problem. It doesn't even matter whether you think the value added is worth it. It's worth it to some buyers (like me), and we don't falsely advertise to deceive other buyers into thinking it's worth it to them when it isn't.<br><br>So hush up, go away, and stop telling us how to run our ski resort.<br><br>", "<b>Username: joemama</b><br><br>I would like to propose a few reasons why students drop out of CalTech at a higher rate than the other elite academic shcools, other than the punishing workload:<br><br>1. CalTech has a very, very small enrollment. That's good from a teacher to student ratio standpoint but I've been on the campus--which is big-- and it seems sort of empty and quiet. I think some small percent of students--especially ones who have come from High Schools bigger than CalTech-- will feel that some \"excitement\" is missing from their college experience--and go elsewhere.<br><br>2. CalTech also has a really lousy male to female ratio. I'm sure there are guys who feel, once again, that something important(female companionship and dating and sex) is missing.

I'm sure some students from more pristine environments find the urban campus unattractive. Face it, Los Angeles is not for everyone.<br><br>4. CalTech narrowly focuses on science and engineering (it is a technical institute after all) and all the other programs play second fiddle and are second rate. If a student wants to change majors outside science and engineering, there's nowhere to go. If they want a high quality Business, Humanities, soft-sciences or Arts education, they have to go elsewhere.<br><br>5. CalTech is also primarily a research institution staffed with researchers. A brilliant researcher is not necessarily a brilliant teacher. Some may be dissatisfied with the quality of instruction.<br><br>Put all these potential reasons together and it might account for the unusually high drop out rate at CalTech.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>", "<b>Username: rtkysg</b><br><br>No Joemama,<br><br>Only extreme workload really causes the high drop out. The rest do not count. One variance would be the fact that Caltech difficulty level has turned off the science 'passion' of some students and makes them feel they are better off in other majors. Another would be the smart prestige whore but not hardworking students, they could bear the workload, but they don't like the pressure. Typically these students transfer to Stanford and sometimes Harvard after one year at Caltech.<br><br>", "<b>Username: alleya</b><br><br>I don't agree with #3. Caltech is definitely not an urban campus -- suburban would be a much more apt description. There are no tall buildings around (in fact, our library is the tallest building in Pasadena and will remain that way since there is now a city ordinance banning buildings that tall) and the campus and surrounding area is filled with trees and flowers (anyone heard of the Rose Parade -- it's not a problem that it's in January, because we have roses almost year round). Only people from the rural midwest might think the campus is too \"urban\". Granted, LA is nearby and the pollution in LA is dreadful. But, it's a full 20 minutes away and students rarely find the time to leave Pasadena. I swear, it's like there's a bubble around Pasadena which keeps most of the pollution out -- I really think it's because all the greenery in Pasadena keeps our air much cleaner than LA proper. The one exception is in October when the mountains are burning, and then sometimes the ash in the air gets really bad. (I also can't vouch for what it's like in June-September). Either way, I've never heard students complaining that the campus is too urban for them.<br><br>", "<b>Username: joemama</b><br><br>rtkysg,<br><br>I know CalTech admits who did not enroll (as well as kids who did not apply to CalTech) for reasons 1, 2 and 4.<br><br>It is reasonable to think that these same reasons might apply to a student unhappiness and their ultimately dropping out.<br><br>Here's reasons 1, 2 and 4 for your reference.<br><br><br>1.

Everyone's always up for some fun. Walking around campus this may not seem the case, but I think that in general, the social life isn't bad. In fact, the small size of the student body actually tends to bring out the social side in some of the more introverted students (myself including). The house system is excellent at bringing people together, and with 7 houses you have 7 social teams each putting on a social event every week. If by excitement you mean \"huge sports game\" or \"huge party with lots of alcohol,\" or those are both smaller and less frequent here than they may be at other schools, so one would have to go to LA for that kind of thing. However, they would have no trouble finding something to match their tastes there.<br><br>2 is definitely a factor for some people here, despite the fact that some students date people from Occidental, UCLA, and USC. There is nothing good about a 2:1 male to female ratio, and it is probably the 2nd greatest stressor after the workload. However, I do not think I would feel comfortable attending a school at which affirmative action were a deciding factor in my admission, and in such a school students might look at under-represented minorities/genders (regardless of their actual ability) with less respect due to the fact that they <i>could have</i> been admitted under lower standards than the rest of the students. Although the male:female ratio is an ugly consequence of the fact that the admissions office does not practice affirmative action, it is necessary in order to ensure that everyone here is as talented as possible.<br><br>Alleya addressed 3.

Basically you are saying that Caltech derives value from its high-risk profile.<br><br>To that, I have the following points<br><br>*Don't put words in my mouth - I never said anything about maximizing yields as a whole.<br><br>The point is not that I think it's good for Caltech to maximize its yields among everybody. The point is that Caltech could maximize its yields among people who could do very well at Caltech and would otherwise come to the school were it not for the relatively low graduation rate. I am not talking about Caltech bringing in people who aren't good at science and math. I am talking about Caltech bringing in people who are very good at science and math, and probably would do just fine at Caltech, but don't want to take a risk with their academic career. Surely you're not saying that Caltech has a monopoly on science talent and every other school has no talent.<br><br>*Secondly, you continue to, I think deliberately, turn a blind eye towards those students who do come and don't make it.<br><br>Whether they flunk out and get no degree at all, or successfully transfer to another elite school, what is undeniable is that everybody that Caltech brings in and doesn't graduate represents a human cost. Even in the best case scenario, which is that that person is able to successfully transfer to another elite school, it still would have been better for that person to have never come to Caltech in the first place (i.e. that person should have always gone to that school that he/she ultimately transferred to). But you don't seem to care about that. Some people get hurt. Some people don't make it. However, looks like you either don't see that, or you don't want to see that. In essence, you are sacrificing these people in the name of your prized Caltech 'risk-luxury'.<br><br>Well, I suppose since you're not the one paying the price, maybe that's why you can afford to be so glib about it. If you were the one going through academic difficulty, maybe you'd have a different attitude. So how would you like to be the one that is really struggling at Caltech, only to hear somebody talk about how it's really great that Caltech has this high-risk model of education, and if some people don't make it, that's their problem. What would you think if that were you? Oh wait, I forgot, according to you, Ben Golub, these people aren't important, so who cares, right?<br><br>*Furthermore, consider the changes at Caltech in the last few decades.<br><br>The graduation rate at Caltech is significantly higher than it was just a few decades ago, because Caltech is doing exactly what I have been saying. Looks like Caltech has in fact added other departments to attempt to broaden its course offerings. And Caltech in fact seems to be targeting who it admits with greater precision such that whoever does come is more likely to graduate than the people it admitted in the past. The point is that, for various reasons, Caltech's graduation rate is probably at an alltime high. My point is that it is still not high enough, and in particular, the other schools have been increasing their graduation rate too.<br><br>But Ben Golub, according to your logic, Caltech shouldn't have been doing any of those changes. You said it yourself- you want to compare Caltech to a high-risk extreme skiing resort or a high-luxury Rolex. So that means that all of the things that Caltech has been doing in the last few decades are obviously wrong, because they are taking away from that risk-premium that you value so much. So I want to hear you criticize the Caltech administration for all their changes, and with the same fury that you use on this forum. I want to hear you castigate the administration for making Caltech softer and obviously taking away from that hard-edge that you like so much. Caltech should instantly close down all those extra departments that broaden the school's offerings, because they're taking away from Caltech's hard edge, right? All the things that Caltech has been doing to target its students more and more, Caltech should not be doing, right? In fact, Caltech should really go back to the \"old Caltech\" where far less students graduated. You mock my ideas as 'training wheels' and 'ski padding', but what exactly has Caltech been doing lately, if not adding 'training wheels and ski padding'?<br>\"\"So hush up, go away, and stop telling us how to run our ski resort.\"\"<br><br>You know, Ben Golub, I used to respect you.

So basically, you just want me to stop writing - in other words, censorship. Hey pal, isn't the whole point of a discussion forum to hear different ideas, even if you don't agree with them? Why even have a forum if people aren't allowed to express their ideas? So basically you are saying that if somebody expresses an idea that you don't like, then that person should just go away?

I am sorry, sakky, if Tech does not cater to the wishy-washy student who changes their major every few years. There are colleges for that, and those students are free to attend them, no one is holding these Tech applicants at gunpoint to apply. And I understand that despite how focused an 18 year old may be as they enter college, they may want something entirely different by their sophomore year, and Caltech indeed does NOT have the facilities to help a student transition from physics to business, and these students leave. But this can be viewed in a positive light, why not be 'forced out' of Caltech in college rather than bum through a less rigorous program and then end up in industry with the realization that the student hates their field of study?<br><br>Why should Caltech make itself 'safe' for you, sakky and itsallgood? Not every student wishes the 'safety' of grade inflation at HYP. Feel free to take the safe route and graduate from a less hardcore school and achieve a wonderful career with a nice salary. I, on the contrary, would take the risk and do something extraordinary. And I find it rather rude that this topic on comparing two schools' engineering departments has been hijacked for an ego-boosting anti-Caltech session<br><br>", "<b>Username: slippythekid2002</b><br><br>First of all, for posterity, I'd like to apologize for Ben. Please, get a hold of yourself.<br><br>There are a lot of things wrong about Caltech, but the good thing is that with a little help from friends, it doesn't matter in the end.<br><br>Before I get on topic, I'd like to just reiterate that the weather here is absolutely awesome.<br><br>Now, on the subject of failing out. Frosh do it to themselves. Our first two terms are on p/f, and upperclassmen encourage frosh to take it easy for a reason. There are several reasons frosh fail out:<br><br>* They don't listen to upperclassmen (ie, they take too many classes)<br>* They don't want to work<br>* They don't want to collaborate<br><br>These are all consequences of the very special matriculants we get here. Some frosh are really ambitious. You often don't learn until later that basic classes are really not that useful. You learn how to teach yourself here. The reason why biologists and chem-majors learn epsilon-delta proofs as frosh is so they can follow proofs in their own textbooks, not for \"rigor.\" In any case, if you talk to any upperclassmen, or (god forbid) listen to your faculty advisor, the first problem is eliminated.<br><br>The second is unavoidable, and a little related to the first. Some people get here, and realize that they just don't feel like doing work. Whatcha gonna do? I know only one case of this in my class: one guy just sat in the stairway, doing puzzles--just didn't want to work.<br><br>Lastly, collaboration is a necessity. The lone scientist is a myth, and collaboration is what makes life here fun. If you can't work together in a team, don't like sharing insights, etc, then you learn quick. If you don't learn, then Caltech sentences you to misery until you do. Alot of things work like that here.<br><br>The switching majors argument is lame. Many people switch from phys to geo or astro, chem to bio, etc. You can sometimes switch even up to the end of 2nd year--certainly after first. However, part of the reason some frosh beat themselves up is because they're unsure, and so want to take a little of everything. I know I did, but it all worked out.<br><hr><br><br>Now that that's done, here's my take. We do some pretty cool stuff here--science /and/ engineering, parties and fun stuff. And people really don't give our humanties classes enough credit--they are top notch. If you don't make life hard for yourself (ie, emphasizing class # vs. class grades) then you'll do alright here.

This institution charts its own course based on what we think is best. Sometimes we've become more rigorous (the 1930's), sometimes less (the 1980's and 90's).

However, this changed once I started to learn more about it, to understand Caltech beyond its prestigious name. During the last summer and fall I researched the institute, visited the campus and stayed in Pasadena. I attended several info sessions and talked to a lot of alumns. I even wrote my application essays and finished my application.<br><br>But ultimately, my application was not submitted. Although there is no doubt in my mind that Caltech has the best science undergrad department in the whole nation, and its theoretical engineering is arguebly the best, I realized that math and science might not be what I would like to do afterall. It just was not the right fit for me. Honestly, I was also turned off a little by the terrible male-to-female ratio, and was scared of the workload. I had spent numerous years in an Iranian gifted and talented school in Tehran, in which studying and research are all that students do. I absolutely did not want to go back to that and become \"****\" so to speak.<br><br>Clearly, Cal Tech is not the right fit for me. But that doesn't mean I can bash the school. People who drop out are at fault themselves for deciding to attend such a school in the first place. True, I chickened out, but I believe that was the right thing to do, or I might have ended up transferring to some other place (assuming I would have gotten in, which was very unlikely).<br><br>", "<b>Username: sakky</b><br><br>Ben Golub, of course you don't have to care what I think. I never said that you are forced to care about what I think.<br><br>However, the whole point of a discussion board is to hear a set of diverse opinions. Not to sound like a Founding Father, but it is precisely through freedom of expression that you are able to formulate better ideas. I don't see you going around challenging anybody else on CC by telling them that you don't care what they think. The point of the Caltech subsection of CC is not to post ideas that you, Ben Golub, or anybody at Caltech necessarily care about. This is not your private forum, nor is it the private forum of the Caltech administration. There are plenty of people on CC whose posts I don't care about, but I don't get in their faces about it. The point of a discussion forum is to hear different opinions, even if you don't like them or don't care about them.<br><br>And to Steelpangolin, again, you have tagged me with saying something that I never said. I never said anything about Caltech lowering its standards. I said that Caltech has a problem with students who aren't able to complete the program. I never said that Caltech has to lower its standards to fix this problem. Another way, which is the one I support, is to simply not admit those students who aren't going to make it anyway. After all, what exactly is the point of bringing in students who aren't going to graduate anyway? Let them go to another school where they will be able to succeed.<br><br>Some would say that you can't really tell who is going to graduate and who isn't, and of course you can't do it perfectly. But there are ways to make it better. For example, you can look at the statistical data of who made it and who didn't over the last X years, look at their application data, find some common themes of those students who didn't make it, and simply admit fewer of those students.<br><br>For example, maybe Caltech will find that those applicants who score less than a 700 on their Math SAT-1 have an extremely high chance of flunking out (I don't know if this is true, I am just using this as an example). Then Caltech should admit fewer such students. True, Caltech already admits few such students anyway, but the data would indicate that Caltech should admit still fewer. Or maybe Caltech finds that certain high schools produce a high percentage of poorly-performing Caltech students. Then Caltech should simply admit fewer students from those high schools. I don't claim to know what the key factors will turn out to be, but I am saying that Caltech could go and find out if it wanted to.<br><br>The issue seems to be not that Caltech can't find out, but that it doesn't really want to find out. Why not? It gets to something I've been pointing out here for awhile - I think that Caltech deliberately wants to flunk out a higher percentage of its students relative to its peer schools, because they see it as 'proof' of its rigor. In other words, Caltech seems to actually enjoy it. And that, to me, seems pretty harsh. You are elevating yourself by stepping on the bodies of your fallen students. Lest you think that I'm being too harsh in my characterization, just go back through this thread and you'll see the quotes of several Caltech people here who all seem to relish in stereotyping everybody who has problems at Caltech, that all those people who have problems are all just stupid and lazy and hence they deserve what they get. Who's really being harsh here, me or them? How would you like to be one of those students who is having difficulty at Caltech, only to have other Tech'ers calling you stupid and lazy and so you deserve to have problems? Hence, the attitude among some at Caltech seems to be \"Who cares if we are stepping on some of our fallen students? Those students suck, so they deserve to get stepped on.\" So not only are they being stepped on, but you have a bloodthirsty crowd who is saying that it is right that they be stepped on. Talk about adding insult to injury.<br><br>You (steelpanglion) ask what am I trying to prove here? Well, first of all, I think that that whole attitude that 'those who have problems at Caltech deserve to have problems' - that attitude ought to be repudiated. You (steelpanglion) at least don't go around implying that your fallen comrades deserve to be fallen because they were clearly too lazy and stupid to survive.<br><br>And secondly we can debate whether students who come to Caltech and don't succeed deserve some of the blame for choosing the wrong school. But I think what is clear is that Caltech also deserves some of the blame for admitting them. Caltech can't just slough off all responsibility onto the students. Caltech had a hand in the situation as well. The same question arises again - why admit people who aren't going to make it?<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>\"I think that Caltech deliberately wants to flunk out a higher percentage of its students relative to its peer schools\"<br><br>What nonsense. We would pretty easily be among the top 3 on the U.S. News list every year (which unfortunately is such a big deal) if we raised our graduation rate. There are plenty of incentives to do it. Caltech doesn't TRY to keep that number low -- we are just unwilling to sacrifice our core mission to raise it, despite all the gains if we did.<br><br>As for admitting fewer students who will fail, can I just say flat out (though I've tried to say it courteously before) ... I've sat on the admissions committee thinking about these things for a year, and looking at the data, etc. I've spent lots of time talking to people who have been looking at this data for 20 years each. I'd be willing to bet you've never read applications for undergraduate admission at selective admissions, let alone Caltech.<br><br>The outcome: Caltech COULDN'T be any more rigorous in screening out students who won't make it. Almost the slightest sign of weakness already gets you excluded. By the way, a large number of the kids who fail out came with pretty much flawless applications. Failure has more to do with character, perseverance. We read closely, we try to catch that stuff, but the data just aren't good enough... The point is that it is simply *impossible* to screen for a 95% graduating class based on high school data. You can't point to an institution as hard as Caltech that does that with high school data to use as a counterexample.

The increased difficulty accounts for lower graduation rate.<br><br>---<br><br>*Another way to put all this: two students of the same caliber and major will, on average, have to do tougher coursework at Caltech than MIT. It's true that for some majors, like math and physics, the work is just as tough at both places, that is, MIT = Caltech. But for a variety of other majors, the requirements at MIT are acknowledged to be less stringent than those at Caltech, that is MIT &lt; Caltech, since, for instance, a bio major at MIT takes the same bio courses she would have taken here, but no quantum physics.

There 's a subtle, yet tremendously important point to be made. Training people's minds is only one purpose. As Ben Golub has himself admitted, it seems that one of the other purposes of those classes is, basically, to flunk certain people out. For example, consider the quote of:<br>\"\"The graduation rate is higher for MIT students because they don't have to take the courses that account for most dropouts here (quantum mechanics and proof-based analysis and linear algebra).\"\"<br><br>Aha, so the truth comes out. The purpose of the class is not just to make some students stronger. It's also to make bad students to drop out.

Now, again, is it useful for economists to know QM from a \"mind-training\" aspect? Of course it is. Do they need to know it? I don't think so. After all, I would argue that the majority of all Economics Nobel Prize winners never took QM. Yet here you are, potentially denying somebody an economics degree because he can't handle QM, when the fact is, QM is not necessary to become a good economist. Useful but not necessary.<br><br>Hence, I have no problem in recommending that econ students take QM. That's fine. But to make the granting of the economics degree contingent upon passing QM - you go too far.<br><br>However, all of this discussion misses the basic point that I've been making which is that I think there has not been a proper focus on those Caltech students who don't do well. We can talk about all those Caltech students who have done very well and that's great for them. But what about the ones who don't? What about the ones who come and really struggle?

You have said before, \"screen out those who will fail with stricter admissions\" to fix the problem. I told you (truly): that's impossible; no institution as hard as Caltech can use high school data to screen out nearly all the students who might fail. When you brought up MIT as an alleged counterexample, I pointed out the requirements are not as hard (no required quantum mechanics, e.g.). You have, since then, been arguing \"get rid of the QM requirements for econ majors, it doesn't make sense, etc.\"<br><br>But THAT's exactly the point where you start telling us to change the education. The very idea of Caltech is that everyone here understands quantum mechanics. It's our quirky little idea, and it's what gives the Caltech name a special unique something (not necessarily better) that nobody else has.

She realized soon after that she really missed Caltech and transferred back. But, she's still been having academic difficulties and currently isn't a student. If it turns out that she doesn't graduate here, I think she'll still say she loved Caltech, as evidenced by her continued attempts to continue here as a student.

He also currently isn't a student, but he works in one of the labs on campus and has been offered some wonderful job opportunities. I've had lengthy discussions with him and he's perfectly happy -- both with his life and with the school. In fact, he helped cheer me up when I failed a class for the first time recently.

Some students will be happier at MIT and others will be happier at Caltech. And still others would be equally happy at either. It depends on the unique priorities of any given student.<br><br>My job is to relay to prospective applicants what is wonderful about MIT. Do I need to take stabs at Caltech in order to do this? Of course not. And why would I? I have enormous respect for both places - this is why I don't get involved in these one-is-better-than-the-other debates.<br><br>The truth is, as an MIT admissions counselor I personally like to think of Caltech as our main ally in this messy world of top-tier schools. Why? Because, generally speaking, MIT and Caltech don't tend to get caught up in the elitist crap that so often flows from some of our peer institutions (who shall remain nameless but who should be obvious). Both MIT and Caltech know who they are, know the worth of the educations they provide, and enjoy a well-earned self-confidence.<br><br>So Mr. Golub, with all due respect - you (and Caltech) are MUCH better than that elitist quote up there.

At the same time, I'd like to point out that I certainly didn't start this discussion with the paragraph you quoted. (Indeed, as I say a few lines down in this post, it started as a respectful conversation about the differences between the two schools' approaches.) As I mention quite frequently, I have a great deal of respect for MIT and think that arguing about \"prestige\" of \"eliteness\" is incredibly dumb. On this point, you and I agree.<br><br>That doesn't change the fact that, even in the MIT-Caltech market, lots of people make their decision based on those factors. And this thread, which was initially a very subdued pro-and-con discussion in which I went out of my way to point out MIT's many virtues (diversity of curriculum, practical relevance, etc.), turned into a Caltech-bashing party officiated by some **** (pages 4-10, or something).<br><br>While I hate that they do this, I really can't sit around quietly while a prestige-focused individual like sakky insists that we are an evil place with far too high a dropout rate while MIT provides an education exactly alike in difficulty with a lower dropout rate. I also hate that, unless I spoke up, far too many people would take the claims of sakky, etc. at face value. How do I know that they would? People whom I know in real life have told me that they believed some of the (ludicrous) Caltech-bashing posts on this board when nobody bothered to correct those posters.<br><br>I promise, Mr. Jones, if I thought that most people ignored trollish \"Caltech sucks, MIT is better\" nonsense as the nonsense that it is, I wouldn't waste my time on this.<br><br>Unfortunately, sometimes what they say about Caltech (e.g. about our relatively high dropout rate) is true. What's false is the claim that other places have few of our problems and all of our virtues. In this case, the only way to answer the objection (as opposed to folding and letting my school look second-rate) is to point out that those other schools -- sometimes MIT -- don't share exactly all the same virtues.<br><br>In fairness, I think that you would probably not be too happy yourself if somebody persistently bashed MIT for being too hard on its students (\"driving some to depression\", etc.) and lauded Harvard for being \"more prestigious,\" less depressing, and offering just as rigorous an education across the board. At the very least, that would be unfair. So hopefully at least you can understand my feelings.<br><br>I am very much with you in the hope that MIT and Caltech can remain the noble places that they are without being dragged into stupid arguments like this one.

I would argue that being forthright about the merits of Caltech - without feeling the need to compare the school to any other, either positively or negatively - shows a quiet, affirming self-confidence. By defending Caltech so rigorously using comparisons, however, it makes it seem like you feel the need to prove something. I say this respectfully: Caltech doesn't need to <i>prove</i> itself to anyone, at least not to anyone who matters. And by trying to do so, I fear that you're accomplishing the opposite of your intention.<br>\"\"So hopefully at least you can understand my feelings.\"\"<br><br>I wholeheartedly do. I am just suggesting that, as representatives of two of the coolest schools in the world, we set a standard of class and respect for others to follow.

Hence, if (ii) holds, Caltech really does take poor care of its students compared to peer schools. So the only way to deny the conclusion that we take poor care of our students (which I think is false, and you probably agree) is to take issue with claim (ii), which unavoidably concerns places <i>other</i> than Caltech.<br><br>I think the right answer would have been to point out that there are academic hurdles at Caltech that don't arise at other schools, and that other schools would face similar problems if they had the same hurdles... in those words. I probably wouldn't have ruffled any feathers had I said it that way, and I should have said it that way. (In fact, I did say it that way at least twenty times, starting on the first page, and then lost my temper, but that's not an excuse... losing one's temper with **** isn't a thing for a self-respecting person to do.

Both approaches present unique challenges and considerations about long-term strategy. But I would never claim that one set of choices is \"better\" than another; the world desperately needs a diversity of practices in this area.<br><br>I get frustrated when people assume we should have precisely the same goals and the same results, and that goes both ways. I think its ridiculous when people say MIT betrayed some duty (sold out) by seeking a broad, and less exclusively scientific focus -- it has gained immensely in social and humanitarian aspects as a result. And I think its equally ludicrous to say Caltech is inhumane in not copying the exact practices of its esteemed peer schools (and not achieving the exact same numbers) -- if we did that, we would lose so much of our unique value.<br><br>This is all a rather long-winded way of saying that my frustration, expressed so inappropriately in that passage you quoted earlier, does not indicate disrespect for you or your institution -- just a desire that people would leave each school to pursue its own focus, without claiming that either place is evil for doing so.<br><br>So, please accept my apologies, and thank you for your reasonable and kind words throughout this discussion.<br><br>", "<b>Username: benjones</b><br><br>Thank you Ben for your kind and heartfelt responses, and thank you for accepting my invitation.

In the interest of fuller disclosure, I will add that I know personally only one young woman other than my daughter who was accepted by MIT; she was also accepted by Caltech.<br><br>In the past few months, I have been disconcerted by the anti-female bias that has been evident in your posts regarding MIT. I have not responded before today because: a) I told myself I was too busy to become involved in a message board war (and I am); b) you are a very young man, and I am older and wiser (mathematicians may peak early, but mothers don't); c) you are not an official representative of Caltech, and I am aware that the administration does not share your viewpoint.<br><br>Ben Jones has taken the high road and reminded us that both schools are truly amazing institutions who on their own are enough reason for Americans to have pride in our youth and hope for our future. But it is my concern for that future that brings me here today. I don't represent MIT or Caltech. I'm here as a mother, as a mother of a girl who when she first accessed the Internet sought out the websites for NASA and the JPL and Caltech, a girl who at seven began saving her pennies for her future at Caltech.

Do the arithmetic.<br><br>What concerns me most is that over the months of your increasingly bold statements about the women at MIT, other Caltech undergraduates have not risen to the challenge and argued against you. In fact, on one of my visits to Caltech, a tour guide told me that Caltech would be a better choice for a female than MIT, because a young woman accepted at MIT would run the risk of being treated by the men around her as if she were an \"affirmative action\" candidate. Is the culture at Caltech based on the underlying assumption that the thousands of female mathematicians and physicists and engineers who don't attend Caltech should expect to be treated as inferior?<br><br>One day you may be in a position at a university, or a corporation, to hire a woman who graduated from MIT (or Cornell, or Georgia Tech, or Stanford).

Statistically men deal with numbers more and more men apply to Caltech. Women also apply and are admitted based on the exact same criteria as a man. When a girl walks into an interview, the only thing the interviewers see is achievment. They do not have any quota to fill. If 50 women get into Caltech one year, awesome. If none get in it's the same to the school. I've been reading up on Caltech admissions pretty heavily because I am hoping to transer and this is my understanding based all of the information I have gotten.<br><br>Ben was saying that the above scenario does not exist at MIT. Obviously they are still going to take extraordinary applicants over ones with more average achievments but, instead of looking only at achievments, there is a quota they fill every year. It's nothing about sexism above what MIT does. I know girls at Caltech and they were all lucky enough to have done research since middle school because their family members ran labs. They got in on merit, not because of any special consideration.<br><br>I'm sure in Ben were hiring people for a project and he saw a woman went to MIT then he would probably have a bias towards a woman at Caltech.

It is wonderful to read such cogent prose and such a closely argued position. As a lover of good writing and good argument, I couldn't refrain from pointing that out.<br><br>First, to dispose of preliminaries, you correctly surmise that my posts here should never be interpreted as officially representing the position of Caltech on any issue. On this forum, I'm just a Caltech student on a message board, like many others, irrespective of whatever else I do with my copious free time.<br><br>All that aside, I owe you a substantive response to your main points. You cited the comment made by me in another thread:<br>\"\"There's no doubt that [MIT] is denying Axline-quality scientists to admit, in their place, girls and minorities of middling intellectual talent, plus singers, dancers, water polo players, etc. who would get mauled by many Caltech kids in a head-to-head academic match-up. Let me say, first, that there's nothing wrong with that in itself. It is certainly MIT's right as a university, and it makes for a diverse and vibrant community.\"\"<br><br>I was alluding here to the fact that MIT sometimes does not accept students who win Caltechs highest full-ride Axline academic scholarship for freshmen. Admittedly, this happens quite infrequently, but it does happen. A typical winner of the Axline has perfect scores, perfect grades in every subject, and, most importantly, scientific extracurricular achievement that completely tops out even in the extremely research-heavy Caltech pool  original research or university coursework that blows away even the Caltech professors who read these applications (not a low bar to hop, I promise you). Also, it is just simply true that there are students at MIT who, on any mildly reasonable evaluation of <i>broadly scientific</i> talent and achievement at the time of their admission, would rank substantially below these Axline students. Usually, those admitted students are exceptionally desirable for MIT due to their mind-blowing nonacademic talents or the valuable diversity that they would bring.<br><br>(To be intellectually honest: I have just <i>asserted</i> this proposition, without including an appendix bearing it out with rigorous data. It would be tedious to do this, and it would certainly require more effort than I can typically expend on a CC post. If anyone familiar with the relevant talent pools would like to seriously challenge the assertion, I would probably go to the trouble of compiling such an appendix to defend my integrity; it would only require the side-by-side comparison of two people for all to inspect, though you can see why this presents various difficulties. But, to be honest, I doubt that anyone informed thinks that what I said is in doubt.)<br><br>As I earnestly say over and over again, there is nothing either <i>dishonest</i> or <i>wrong</i> or about MITs policies in this respect. Yes, the university values nonacademic prowess and diversity of experience <i>comparably with</i> pure scientific achievement. Sometimes, one applicant beats another in the first two categories so overwhelmingly that he is more valuable to the school, despite the superior book smarts of the latter student. But to admit the most worthy students <i>given the schools aims and values</i> is not only MITs right, but its duty. The fact that some people and institutions do not share the same values does not render MITs pursuit of those values suspect.<br><br>None of that changes the straightforward truth elucidated above  that sometimes, for MIT, nonacademic qualities trump pure scientific strength. The one serious (and inexcusable) flaw in my quote is that the word comparatively should have been inserted before middling  I wrongly assumed it would be understood. It is indisputable that everyone admitted to any top university is head and shoulders above the broad social average. But, as I argued at length above, some of those admitted to MIT for their nonacademic gifts or diversity value are significantly less impressive academically than some of those denied despite their overwhelming scientific talents.<br><br>I should say that Caltech, contrary to occasional perception, does not have a magical and completely academically meritocratic process. But we do  as I have come to understand it  consistently and unabashedly try to have a process in which scientific accomplishment and curiosity trump almost all other types of achievement.<br><br>Are the nonacademic and diversity admits at MIT quite amazing at science, compared to the vast majority of their high school peers? Undoubtedly. Are they <i>nearly as accomplished</i> in science as some of the people MIT could have had instead for those spots? Certainly not. And the bottom line is that Caltech tries very hard always to resolve these dilemmas in favor of the scientifically superior applicant.<br><br>I hope you now understand my view, which I do earnestly hold, that admission to Caltech is more reliable signal of pure academic talent focused on science than admission almost anywhere else. It is not hard to see why this is so. A students admission to Caltech means that, in our quite imperfect evaluation, the student was, <b>in scientific talent, achievement, and curiosity,</b> one of the top <i>n</i> people among our applicants, where <i>n</i> is the number we could admit. It is hard to make that claim of, say, MIT. (Remember the Axlines that they denied  did MIT really admit <i>1735</i> better scientists than one of the <i>15</i> best in our pool? Even if you think that MITs pool is stronger, it would be a difficult case to argue. Even factoring in the inherently human and subjective nature of these evaluations, its a pretty hopeless case.)<br><br>So <i>thats</i> why Caltech students often say that a female or minority or athlete getting into Caltech need not worry that she is there for reasons other than her academic talent  because our process is more purely focused on talent. For those to whom that knowledge is important, the purity of the Caltech process is precious.<br><br>And, relatedly, to answer your question: if I were hiring for a job in which the most important thing was scientific talent, of course I would take admission to Caltech, <i>a priori</i> as a more reliable indication of it. With other schools, Id have to think about what nonacademic factors could have swung this person toward the top of a list he would not have topped on talent taken alone. But I should note, in fairness, that if I were hiring a person for a people job, as opposed to a purely analytical one, I would (before I knew anything else about the candidate) probably value MITs diploma more, and Princetons more than that; MIT admits have a tendency to be more socially polished, and Princetons even more so. Different diplomas send different signals. As Ben and I so amicably agreed in this thread, the beauty of these schools lies in their contrasts.<br><br>So, to answer your other accusation: <i>of course</i> I dont assume that any woman or athlete or minority from another institution is inferior to one here (thats a cheap shot). I just know that, due to the complexity of the admissions values at other schools, those students presence at those institutions, in itself, does not send an academic signal as strong as their presence here would. And in view of the points above, I doubt even you would dispute the soundness of that judgment.<br><br>I wont devote much airtime to your cheapest shot  that this knowledge makes me a sexist. Knowing the fact that some people are evaluated in a certain process under different standards does not, in any sane persons mind, constitute a prejudice, in the usual negative sense, against those people.<br><br>To conclude, Id like to convey my praise and respect for your daughter. Our world desperately needs people like her. Id like to think that my institution and I convey our respect most palpably through the purity of our process  by giving her the fairest scientific shake we can.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tech_fan</b><br><br>By the way -- the original short message (about how MIT denied Axlines, etc.) was written hastily a few days ago and I got involved in a discussion I should have avoided.

When I decided not to apply to MIT it was solely because of location (I was in slightly unusual circumstances at the time, because otherwise this would not have been such a factor).<br><br>ii) I think MIT is a great school. I think Caltech is a great school. There are ups and downs to both, but that is true of anything in life.<br><br>iii) I think Caltech *is* a harder school than MIT. This is not simply because of the one-way rivalry; I was very suspicious of this claim at first so I did my own research by looking at OCW homeworks, class websites, etc. I found that Caltech students typically take more classes than MIT students do (5 classes would be average at Caltech, but 4 for MIT), and that the level of rigor is a bit higher in the core curriculum. For example, whereas MIT has a basic intro Physics course, but special versions for those who want a more theoretical approach/hands on experience, Caltech only has the special versions.<br><br>So a student at MIT could take similar coursework if he wanted to overload and enroll in lots of extra stuff; it simply isn't required. I don't know what happens in the individual majors. This is just what I see in the core, general-ed courses.<br><br>iv) I feel there is *some* justification in saying that MIT has a weaker pool of students, just going by the straight academics/test scores/etc. Caltech's SAT scores tend to be higher, for one, but more importantly, the general vibe I get is that the admissions committee just wants to make absolutely sure that you can survive this place easily. So that is to say, if you're extemely smart and scientifically inclined and can show this on your transcript, you're probably going to be admitted to Caltech.

This makes complete sense. Most of my classmates didn't go on to graduate school (in physics), and (almost) all of us welcomed the chance to take classes in other academic disciplines. The extremely flexible program reflected this. Caltech physics majors are expected to continue on in physics, and their rigorous program reflects that.<br><br>b) Caltech is probably more rigorous/difficult than MIT, for somewhat similar reasons. MIT undergrads tend to be interested in industry, at least in my experience, and they have a much wider range of classes. Caltech (and parts of Harvard) also has a culture of \"look how hard I'm working\" which is both kind of cool and kind of unhealthy.<br><br>c) I knew a lot of unhappy Caltech undergrads when I was there, as well as a couple of extremely happy ones. The unhappy ones were those who were interested in other fields besides science (as I knew lots of undergrads through choir, this makes up most of my anecdotal sample), or who realized after a couple of years that they weren't into astro the way they thought they were, or who started chafing (socially and sociologically, not intellectually) at the confines of a rather small school. Those who were extremely happy were those who took full advantage of the research opportunities and were happy as a clam pretty much doing research full time. These people, while they would've done quite well anywhere, were clearly very well suited for Caltech and its amazing opportunities.<br><br>d) I would say the social scene at Caltech, although satisfying to many of those in it, is more skewed than that at MIT, just because there are fewer options. MIT may have a higher variance, but the mean is probably a little closer to the \"real-world\" mean.<br><br>e) I would personally counsel any kid who is bright, ambitious, and interested in other subjects besides his/her (science) intended major to go to MIT. (Actually, I'd recommend a good liberal arts school before MIT, but that's another story.)

Oh, I forgot; I also wanted to comment on what previous posters have said about grad students from prestigious institutions taking undergrad classes in classical (106) and quantum (125) physics. This is true, although I feel that it's not telling the whole story.<br><br>First, *most* physics grad students at caltech do not take these classes, having already had them! Second, although the level of 106 is (somewhat) higher than that of the corresponding junior-level classes at Harvard (e.g., they use Jackson for E&amp;M instead of Griffith), it is lower than that of the grad-student-level classes at Harvard (and I imagine at other institutions, but I can only speak about my experience!), which of course are open to undergrads who wish to take them. We were often a bit frustrated (in 106) that the material didn't go into as much depth as we would have liked. If there *were* a more advanced grad school class available, that's what the grad students would take. But we run into this problem of Caltech being a small school again, plus which Caltech believes, I think rightly, that grad students should by and large be in charge of their own education and not dependent on Grad Classes.<br><br>(I won't talk about 125, as it's undergoing some interesting changes, including a possible bifurcation into a regular-major and advanced/grad pair of courses. But before this development similar things could have been said about that class. Also, I *think* this may happen/be happening with 106 as well, but can't swear to it.)<br><br>What I\"m trying to say in a rather roundabout way is that I think that the average physics major at Caltech takes more difficult and rigorous classes, and definitely more of them, than the average physics major at Harvard; but the top physics major at Harvard will have access to a larger variety of harder classes than his/her Caltech counterpart. That being said, for a scientist, taking classes should NOT be the chief academic experience, and I think Caltech does a better job of fostering that sort of atmosphere.<br><br>...But, you know, it's extremely common for grad students to justify themselves with respect to undergrads (\"those little whippersnappers!\") so you may want to take this post with a grain of salt :) (Also, apologies for hijacking the Caltech/MIT discussion, but I suspect most of what I said about Harvard here is also applicable to MIT.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: 4thfloor</b><br><br>I agree with you completely that \"for a scientist [undergrad major], taking classes should NOT be the chief academic experience,\" so it is good to read from you that Caltech is good at \"fostering such an environment.\" Is it fair to conclude from what you wrote, then, that Caltech undergrads have enough free time after their classess and psets to actually \"take charge of their own education\"? I realize you speak from a grad experience; it would be nice if you can confirm this about undergrads. There is an impression, perhaps mistaken, that Caltech undergrads are -- to exaggerate somewhat -- completely consumed by their classes and psets, in which classes would indeed become the only significant academic experience.

Most professors I've spoken to are aware that Caltech has tougher grading standards than other schools and we take this into account when considering grad admissions.

But because Caltech is known to be so tough, profs in econ and engineering will sometimes cut someone slack with grades that would get dismissed for grads even from the Ivies. There's no set cutoff or formula, but if someone has 4 Cs but good recs from Caltech, we might make phone calls to figure out what's what.<br><br>When I went to grad school many years ago, I almost certainly had the lowest grade point average of my entering class in econ (with several Cs in science classes) but I also got accepted to Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, Minnesota and Northwestern econ partly on the strength of my degree in physics and partly on the basis of phone calls from my professors. In contrast many classmates from good schools with straight As were rejected by some or all of these departments.<br><br>It is worth noting that several prominent economists and political scientists were Caltech undergrads who did not receive their degrees in econ. These profs include Robert Barro, Vernon Smith (Nobel prize), and Roger Noll.<br><br>Having said all that, it is true that going to Tech is high risk. And there is the real possibility of \"flunking in\".

When you buy a Dell PC, you're given the rights to use it, but you're not given the architectural details of how the components fit together, or the source code for the operating system, etc. So, with what Dell is selling you, you couldn't build a pc of your own from scratch.<br><br>This is the same thing -- we'll sell other countries the finished product, but we won't show them how we did it.

Many of us here at Carnegie<br>spoke with him at that time. Yet, even with this degree of preparation,<br>John admits that he wasn't ready for what he found once he began to visit<br>campuses and started talking to faculty and students.<br><br>In this month's Carnegie Perspective, John takes on one of the primary<br>issues raised in the documentary, the decline in the quality of education<br>experienced by many of America's college students. For anyone who cares<br>about the state of the academy, it's a tough piece to read, just as his<br>documentary may be uncomfortable for many to watch. Rest assured that<br>during his frequent periods of residence as a visiting scholar at the<br>Carnegie Foundation, John's role is often that of challenging all of us<br>with equally uncomfortable questions.<br><br><b>By John Merrow </b> </i><br><br>Of all the students I met during nearly two years of working on our PBS<br>documentary about higher education, I continue to be intrigued by a<br>sophomore named Nate. After proudly proclaiming that he was maintaining a<br>3.4 GPA despite studying less than an hour a night, he wondered aloud,<br>\"It's not supposed to be this easy, is it? Shouldn't college be<br>challenging?\" Nate was one of the more enlightened students that we<br>interviewed.<br><br>He talked about his \"boring\" classes, including an English class he<br>described as \"a brain dump.\" We sat in on that class. The teacher had<br>assigned students to write parodies of The Road Not Taken, knowing that to<br>do the assignment well, they would have to read and understand Frost's<br>poem. She was meeting students at their level ... and trying to push them<br>to go beyond it, attempting to move them out of their \"intellectual<br>comfort zone\" and lead them in new directions. Tough job, because Nate and<br>undoubtedly most of his classmates-had obviously NOT read the assignment.<br>Nate had succeeded in high school by figuring out what was going to be on<br>his tests and doing as little as possible. And since that approach also<br>got him into college and was now earning him a solid B average, he saw no<br>reason to change. Ask Nate the purpose of college, and he would probably<br>say something about \"getting a good job.\" The learning part wasn't<br>necessarily what he was paying good money for.<br><br>Although we found this English class stimulating, we could see how<br>frustrating it became for the teacher because of the lack of<br>student-directed engagement and motivation. In this case, the students'<br>expectations didn't match the professor's. Teaching becomes a difficult<br>transaction when students expect to get the diploma that they pay for<br>without caring whether they learn anything in the process. The situation<br>is made more difficult because professors begin classroom teaching at a<br>disadvantage. Few have any training in how to teach. We were very<br>impressed by Tom Fleming, a senior lecturer at the University of Arizona,<br>who took advantage of a faculty development course offered by his<br>institution on teaching theory and effective practices. Using technology<br>in a huge lecture hall, he deftly engaged students, allowing very few to<br>merely get by.<br><br>College used to be a \"sink or swim\" environment, but today, either<br>colleges are giving much-needed \"swimming lessons\"-investing in student<br>success-or they're allowing students to \"tread water\"- giving decent<br>grades for very little work. In the first case, students actually receive<br>an education; in the second, they merely get a degree. It's all too easy<br>for some students and faculty members to settle into a pattern of behavior<br>that looks like an unspoken \"non-aggression treaty,\" in which professors<br>don't ask much of students and the students don't expect much from their<br>professors (as long as they get A's and B's).<br><br>The good news is that many faculty members-those giving swimming<br>lessons-work with energy and imagination to move their students beyond<br>that simplistic \"diploma=$$\" formula. The relationship between Tom Fleming<br>and his students falls into this category. Even more heartening is the<br>fact that many students intuitively know that they're being denied an<br>education and seek out campus experiences that give them what they need.<br>But that 20 or so percent out there treading water are shortchanging<br>themselves and future employers who think that a college degree indicates<br>achievement as well as persistence. And those professors who find it more<br>comfortable to demand little of their students are denied the satisfaction<br>that good teaching affords.<br><br>The shift in the expectations of students and faculty members began around<br>the time that America learned that college graduates made more money than<br>high school graduates-as much as a million dollars more over their working<br>lives. The mantra became, \"If you want an education, then you pay for it.\"<br>The old social contract-the idea that education of individuals is a public<br>good and therefore should in part be publicly financed-is on life support<br>and barely breathing. Instead, \"Education Pays\" is proclaimed on<br>billboards around Kentucky, encouraging kids to go to college just to nail<br>down that good job.<br><br>Kids arrive on campus determined to major in \"business\" and often remain<br>impervious to the efforts of their professors to expose them to new ideas<br>and new information. Our student financial aid system supports the<br>\"investment in me\" approach by making less money available in the form of<br>grants to needy students, and more in the form of loans to be paid back as<br>a return on the individual's investment in themselves. The message our<br>kids get is that they're not students; they're consumers. And if they're<br>willing to settle for \"purchasing\" a degree that means nothing in terms of<br>educational achievement, it's their right. It's their investment. In this<br>environment, professors, colleges, and universities are forced into giving<br>the customers what they want, not necessarily what they should want.<br><br>I admire students who squeeze as much as they can from the college<br>experience, and I salute the teachers who dedicate their energies to<br>seeing students succeed. Too much is left to chance, however, and too many<br>lives are blighted by our national indifference to what is actually<br>happening on our campuses during the years between admission and<br>graduation. What we found is not the equivalent of a few potholes on an<br>otherwise passable highway. Serious attention must be paid at a national<br>level. Other countries are not standing still.

Many people with doctorates really don't earn that much more than people with just bachelor's, and certainly not enough to justify the return-on-investment of spending those extra years in school which you could have spent working. Yet those programs show no signs of disappearing.

Suppose I study something very esoteric and inapplicable (say, the history of Latin and Greek syntax and morphology between 300 and 200 B.C.). Suppose this thing has the property that is much easier for people who are very smart than for people who are not so smart. Now suppose employers were to hire business consultants only based on whether one got a degree in a subject like this. If you get the degree, you get the job, which pays you <i>p</i>, in dollars, over a lifetime. Now, even a dumb person can get the degree, but it'll be hard. So the cost in effort and pain, and money <i>c</i> (converted to dollars) to the dumb person is high; hopefully so high that <i>p - c &lt; 0</i> and getting the degree is not worth it, even though it pays <i>p</i>. So stupid people wouldn't get the degree, even if they could with enough pain. But for smart people, <i>c</i> is smaller; studying is easier, and often less expensive in money too. So <i>p-c > 0</i>. So they get the degree, signaling they are smart, which gets them the job. Thus, even if the standard for employment is a degree in an esoteric and useless field, there is still a way for smart people to use this to inform employers that they're smart. The upshot being that college can be useful in the job market doesn't have to teach you anything applicable.<br><br>But this model had the crucial feature that learning is easier for smart people... so intelligence still comes in somewhere along the line. I don't see how this is so in the parental wealth situation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rtkysg</b><br><br>\"\"but then again I've met plenty of kids at Caltech that are very strong at literature or history or foreign languages. I'd say the atmosphere here is somewhat more intellectual than at many of our peer schools, and that goes across the board -- (I say this having taken courses in both math/science and the humanities at Princeton for a year).\"\"<br><br>I would agree with the notion that Caltech has a very strong if not the strongest intellectual atmosphere among the US universities. However, I also met plenty of Caltech kids who know nothing about history, sociology, etc, but math and physics and science related subject. My perception however, would exclude the International (esp. Asian) students, since in Asia, strong literature, history and humanities are also absolutely required to be in the cream of outstanding students and hence let them have the chance to form the very small int'l student body. In this case, however, I refer to the general observation on the students and not any particular one. Pick one by one, Caltech students will overwhelm Stanford (or even MIT) students with their scientific knowledge. But in humanities, many Caltech student don't have the 'necessary' background to start with.<br><br>", "<b>Username: SHABIN</b><br><br>So, the first question arises again, finally :<br><br>[size=+1]<b><u> Caltech vs MIT for engineering</u></b>[/size]<br><br>[size=+2]<b>Did anyone win? </b>[/size]<br><br><br><br><br><br><b><br>?<br>[size=+1]?
