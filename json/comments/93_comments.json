Outside of the academic/scientific communities there are MANY folks who have heard of Stanford but have no idea what MIT is. Maybe it's the sports thing. Which brings me to the main point to this thread.<br><br>Stanford is a complete university with arts and social science programs on an equal footing, at the least, with engineering and science; with professional schools (med and law) that MIT doesnt have and no shortage of pre laws and premeds; and with a more typical, and full, college experience including intercollegiate sports. MIT excels at what it chooses to do. It's great but not for everyone. Stanford has a better financial aid program for middle income kids. It is west coast centric. MIT is probably better for low income applicants.

Obviously, it's focused on those who have an interest in science/engineering. However, it's misleading to imply that MIT is UNLIKE Stanford in that it does NOT have sports or strong arts, humanities, and social science programs.<br><br>MIT has something like 40 varsity sports and an extremely high rate of participation in these sports. They're well-funded programs and provide an extra dimension to life at MIT, a place which is often stereotyped as being \"nerdy.\" MIT doesn't depend on sports for clout with potential applicants or the general public, as Stanford might (aside from it's academic pull), but it is factually incorrect to suggest that Stanford is unlike MIT in that it provides a full college experience including intercollegiate sports. Intercollegiate sports are alive and well at MIT.<br><br>Further - MIT is science/engineering focused, but MIT has departments in writing, literature, foreign languages/literatures, history, anthropology, political science, linguistics/philosophy, economics, and a rockin' business school, among others I probably forgot. Of course MIT is a \"complete\" university. MIT humanities/social science/arts programs are great, just like Stanford's. The student body is more interested in science/engineering so those departments are larger, which makes sense. MIT also has a bunch of premeds.<br><br>But it is true that MIT is not for everyone. If you got in, though, then MIT is a good place for you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mikalye</b><br><br>\"\"Stanford is a complete university with arts and social science programs on an equal footing, at the least, with engineering and science;\"\"<br>Agreed, MIT's programs in the humanities are not of the same standard as their offerings in Engineering. That is not to say they aren't excellent, they are, and if you choose to be one of the very small number of (say) English Literature majors at MIT, then you get a level of individualised care not possible in EECS, but they are not generally on an equal footing with Engineering and Science.<br>\"\"with professional schools (med and law) that MIT doesnt have and no shortage of pre laws and premeds\"\"<br>Almost agreed. 10% of an MIT undergraduate class goes on to medical school, 5% go on to law school. I believe that MIT too has no shortage of prelaws and premeds. Both have top 10 ranked business schools, though MIT's is arguably more involved in undergraduate education than Stanford's. There is no denying that MIT does not have a law school or a medical school, but I'm not sure that that matters as much for undergraduate education, particularly as MIT both offers classes in law and offers full cross-registration with Harvard a mile up the road. I was not pre-med, but while at MIT, I got a job in a lab attached to the Harvard Medical School in Boston. I don't think that MIT not having a medical school matters so much given the resources that pre-meds have at MIT.<br>\"\"and with a more typical\"\"<br>Agreed<br>\"\"and full, college experience\"\"<br>Disagree Completely<br>\"\"including intercollegiate sports.\"\"<br>MIT last year fielded more NCAA intercollegiate teams than Stanford, albeit mostly in Division III. MIT also offers a more participatory intramural sports program (more than 75% of students take part) than most other schools including Stanford. What an NCAA division I school offers is the whole communal gathering at the Sports stadium, something that doesn't happen in the same way at MIT, but if you are interested in playing as opposed to watching sport, then MIT is probably superior to Stanford for most students.<br>\"\"MIT excels at what it chooses to do.

Apart from that, I am not certain that this is true.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mia305</b><br><br>Mikalye:<br>Re finaid: MIT is better for low incomes. It is free (tuition room board travel etc)for family incomes less than 75k and doubles Pell grants. For low incomes, Stanford is free for incomes less than 60k. For higher incomes, however, Stanford, unlike MIT, has a policy of being tuition free for incomes up to 100k (and it also caps assessment of student assets at 5 instead of 25%, caps home equity, divides parental contribution by number of kids in college, among other benefits). I am not going to get into anecdotal evidence as well. Suffice it to say that I disagree with your disagreement as to which is better for which income group.<br><br>Re sports and the college experience: For starters there's a huge difference between Stanford sports and MIT's DIII efforts. I appreciate MIT's efforts; it's just not the same thing and the experience is undeniably different. Moreover, it's such an obvious and significant difference that it is unclear what you are arguing over. Stanford I believe is second to MIT in the breadth of its sports offerings. However, at Stanford, unlike MIT, the major sports amount to social events and alums continue to follow Stanford sports well after graduation. Hell, the games are even televised. At MIT there will be no rooting for the alma mater in the annual NCAA basketball tournament and office pool. Additionally, having a community that includes a majority of non-science types, definitionally makes for a more typical college experience. I am not being critical of MIT. I greatly appreciate it for what it chooses to be. It is more narrowly focussed and, to me that is one of its strengths.

I've taught at Stanford as a guest professor, and my daughter is now a sophomore at MIT, so I have some experience with both institutions.

I have only just visited the two campuses, but even from those experiences I gained to very different perspectives. Stanford, to me, felt very \"country-clubbish,\" what you describe as \"athletes, legacies, and faculty offspring.\" I simply could not picture myself there for four years, even with the world renowned science and math departments. I did, however, fall in love with MIT the moment I toured the campus and saw students discussing problem sets, eating donuts, and just plain having fun. There was this nonchalance and humor behind the \"drinking water from the firehose\" academics that just captivated me. No negative comment on Stanford at all, just didnt seem right for me.<br><br>", "<b>Username: prime235</b><br><br>yea. the culture is wayy different. if your a sci/math person you'll feel at home at MIT.<br><br>mmhm, well said.<br><br>", "<b>Username: oasis</b><br><br>I was admitted to both Stanford and MIT back in 07 and I pretty much decided on whim that I was going to come to MIT.

After coming back from Stanford, I ask myself why people even need bikes at MIT lol. Although the campus is pretty and all, the great space between buildings and dorms kind of turned me off. I really enjoy the fact that MIT's pretty connected and you can access all the main group buildings even by tunnel when it's snowing out.<br><br>Moreover, Boston's just a stone's throw away from MIT, and the Charles River is absolutely gorgeous in the summer/fall. Stanford? San Fran is quite a ways away by train, and Palo Alto's too far to walk to on a consistent basis (biking is reasonable, or by car). I would say that the only things that Stanford definitely trumps MIT on in terms of locale is its awesome architecture and nice weather. But other than that, I've grown to love living in Boston and even the ease of access to so many other colleges (and their students) like Harvard, BU, BC, Tufts, Wellesley...etc. What does Stanford have?

O___O<br><br>", "<b>Username: VictoryCoorg</b><br><br>Some time has passed since the last discussion in this old thread. I would appreciate current opinions on MIT vs Stanford for Maths &amp; Computer Science.<br><br>A couple of other angles that I am especially interested in :<br><br>(1) Is it kind of true that MIT is more of a pressure-cooker kind of environment with lots of intensely academic people which can sometimes lead to unhealthy competition and pressures?<br><br>(2) For a family with high assets (in stocks) and low income, which is likely to give greater financial aid?<br><br>(3) If one definitely wants to go on to Ph.D. program after undergraduate studies, which one would be better?<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mikalye</b><br><br>1) Definitely not true of MIT. Indeed, MIT does a great deal to reduce pressures. The reason that your first term is pass-fail is to reduce the pressure on acclimatising students. There are also no classes of degrees at MIT. You cannot graduate from MIT \"summa cum laude\" for example. You either have an MIT degree or you do not. Indeed, as has been discussed on this board before, many problem sets are designed to be done in groups. This is not calculated to build pressure. From my observation, almost all of the pressure at MIT was generated from within, with students striving to excel, but MIT goes out of its way to avoid a \"pressure-cooker\" environment.<br><br>2) It's totally unclear. FA is calculated differently at different schools. Stamford has a few features in its FA, that are very different from MIT. For example, MIT guarantees to meet a student's full financial need for all for years for all students including international students. MIT also operates need-blind admissions for all students, including international students. Stamford does not. That being said, because Stamford does not make these expensive promises to international students they might or might not make you a more generous offer. Also, all of MIT's FA is need-based. MIT does not consider any factor in determining aid apart from ability to pay. By contrast, although most of Stamford's FA is need-based, a portion of it is also merit-based. Again, your mileage may vary.<br><br>3) What gets you into a PhD program is evidence of skill at research. This is true whether your field is biochemistry or renaissance literature. I would put MIT's UROP program at the top of the tree when it comes to undergraduate research opportunities. But at either institution, you should have opportunities to get involved in real research if a PhD is your ultimate goal.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MITChris</b><br><br>honestly this is a stupid thread.<br><br>the two schools have very little in common aside from being elite academic institutions.<br><br>which one is 'better' depends entirely on the individual student and the community to which they would prefer to belong.<br><br>that answer is going to be different for every single student.<br><br>", "<b>Username: GandalfTheGreat</b><br><br>Actually, I don't think this thread is stupid. If it is about discussing which is \"better\" in a general sense, then, I agree that it depends on the individual and there is really no clear answer. Instead, I take the purpose of this thread to be seeking information about, and discuss, what the differences between the two schools are. That kind of information can help someone decide which might be a better fit for that person.<br><br>That said, let me come to issue 3 above regarding someone who is sure about pursuing Ph.D. after undergrad: As I understand, at Stanford (at least in CS), one directly moves to the PhD program after B.S., but, at MIT, one will have to do a Masters thesis along the way. Right? Does that mean the total time from undergrad to PhD will in general be longer at MIT?<br><br>", "<b>Username: mathboy98</b><br><br>Huh? Pretty sure you do not need a master's to be accepted to the MIT EECS PhD program. If a master's thesis is required en route to PhD, it does not imply a longer time. That would be like saying doing an undergrad thesis means graduating later or so.<br><br>Remark - working in groups can make someone feel dumb if everyone else is more competent at the task at hand. Can...not should.<br><br><br>Also honestly these are both tops in CS. Asking whether there is grade deflation is better than asking which has a hard workload.

Some schools don't go so far as to actually award the master's degree, but just have a ~6-year PhD program. It all works out in the wash.<br><br>Factors like personal motivation, choice of advisor, and research project will have a much greater effect on time to PhD than the program will.<br><br>Also, AFAIK both MIT and Stanford offer five-year co-terminal bachelor's/master's programs for EECS undergrads.<br><br>EDIT: It is, though, significantly putting the cart before the horse to think about Stanford vs. MIT for undergrad based on the policies of the respective PhD programs.

I doubt it--both MIT and Stanford are the two best schools for engineering.<br>2. I think that depends on how seriously you want to pursue squash. Do you want to be on a varsity team? The club team at Stanford also plays other teams.<br>3. Not sure which one is easier, but a few things: Stanford is on the quarter system, so you'll have the opportunity to take more classes. You'll also be able to design your own major (Stanford encourages interdisciplinary study). Double majoring with two sciences or engineering+social science is rather common.<br>4. Not sure which has more, but Stanford currently requires 3 introductory humanities classes, plus another class satisfying the humanities distribution requirement. This might not matter to you, since Stanford's also doing an overhaul of the undergraduate curriculum (the main change being fewer requirements), so it's likely to change soon.<br><br>(By the way, I'm finishing at Stanford now and might be attending MIT for PhD)<br><br>", "<b>Username: molliebatmit</b><br><br>\"\"Which school is it easier to double major in (I want bioengineering, with a double major in EE/biolgoy/ comupter science / or pilitical science)?\"\"<br>It's reasonably common to double-major at MIT -- you just need to complete the required courses for two majors, and if they have overlapping requirements, you can count those courses toward both majors.<br><br>You might be interested in the new course 6-7 biology/EECS joint major (info <a href=\"http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N21/bioeecs.major.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), which might eliminate the need to double-major given your interests.

It is a superb school, and may well be a great choice. There is no such thing as a \"best\" school, though there may be a \"best\" school for any individual student.

However, to suggest that MIT's business school is not up to scratch is very much mistaken.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EngineerEng</b><br><br>I had to make that choice one day, i picked MIT for the start-up culture. Here's a short analysis:<br>1-Boston is the best place for biotechnology investment.<br>2-MIT lets its undergrads take business classes in Sloan, Stanford less so.<br>3-MIT offers many contests for start-ups that undergrads are allowed to participate in, such as seed grants and 100K contest and many many many many others. you will keep on receiving emails of business contests and mixers when ur in MIT.<br>4- MIT alumni founded 26000 companies, Stanford 4500.<br>5-Stanford produced google, sun, cisco, and yahoo. MIT produced Koch industries, Intel, Raytheon, akamai, and mcdonnel douglas. All of these are/were multibillionaire companies, and each was a leader in its field. Yet, while Stanford only produced famous CS companies, MIT produced more diverse business leaders (Koch for chemical, intel for electrics, mcdonnel for planes, now it merged with beoing, raytheon for weapons...)<br>6- Many MIT classes encourage entrepreneurship, and even after classes sometimes groups may proceed with their ideas.<br>7-More room for innovation in mIT due to more engineers and hardcore nerds who are ready to work really hard.<br>8- Silicon Valley remains the top CS hub.<br>9-MIT undergrad course 15 major is seen as the second best undergrad business degree in the US after Wharton, significantly ahead of stanford. For grad, the consensus is that they are almost equal but Stanford takes a slight edge (although i have seen rankings placing MIT higher for grad, such as ARWU ranking and QS for grad finance and administration)<br>10. MIT Sloan has the widest range of electives of any school and has more number 1 ranked programs than other business school in the world (supply chains and informatix, logistics, production operations). Both QS and US News attest to that, and from my experience the consensus seems to be that.<br>11.
