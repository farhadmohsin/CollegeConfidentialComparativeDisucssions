Consequently, I held off until now from writing about it whenever this thread showed up on \u201cLatest Posts.\u201d<br>Bard\u2019s bond rating by Moody\u2019s sits at \u201cB1,\u201d which is the fourth rung down into \u201cjunk-bond\u201d status, or on the 14th quality rung of  21-rung rating scale. This is an measure of the college\u2019s financial health, or lack of it. Personally, I would not want a child of mine attending a college rated so poorly. The poor financials are bound to pose some risk to a student\u2019s undergraduate experience, and the risk could increase if interest rates rise significantly and thus make it difficult for Bard to survive a cash-flow crisis.<br>I\u2019m prepared to be bludgeoned again by some fellow CCers for writing the above. But I am more at peace now, after sharing it. Maybe Bard\u2019s theater program is the best choice for your son.<br><br>", "<b>Username: HCatmom</b><br><br>Thanks.

It\u2019s nice to have a fairly short trip home, but it\u2019s not everything.<br>But I will take issue with the characterization of housing at Hamilton.

But, of course, that was 25 years ago, and most of my favorites have either retired, passed away or moved on to Tufts, Cornell, Northwestern, etc.  If it\u2019s near to you, maybe he could go meet some more professors in his intended major and get a better sense of the department?  As far as choral groups go, he would certainly not be at a loss for opportunities.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BookLvr</b><br><br>@apple123 and @merc81 I will revise my previous statement! I found the dorm that our tour guide showed us on the tour to be underwhelming compared to the dorms which we got to tour at other colleges. I fully recognize that other colleges may have been showing us particularly nice examples of dorm rooms or Hamilton might have chosen a particularly tight space.<br>I also want to make it clear the dorm was not bad. It just wasn\u2019t a highlight, particularly compared to some of the other facilities we saw on the tour. I will add that we saw Hamilton on the same tour we saw Smith and Vassar. I think a lot of the women\u2019s colleges (and colleges that started as women\u2019s colleges like Vassar) have particularly nice dorms. So it could be that if I had seen Hamilton\u2019s dorms after having seen more run-of-the-mill dorms, I would have had a different reaction. I certainly wouldn\u2019t rule Hamilton out based on dorms! And Hamilton\u2019s marketing materials were among my favorite, with tabs like like \u201cStudy What You Love.\u201d That\u2019s a great approach for an open curriculum school!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Trixy34</b><br><br>@BookLvr - did you tour Hamilton in the summer?  We were shown a quad in South.  Some of the other parents said, \u201cFOUR people live in here?\u201d  I kind of chuckled to myself - it did seem small, but back when I went to Hamilton, a quad in South your first year was highly desirable.  Of course, that was also back when any student could have a beer ball on campus and open containers were allowed, so the older students in South would throw great parties open to everyone.  Ahh, memories.  By my second year, the alcohol policy changed and dorm parties became smaller and more private.<br>Anyway, my sense is that, aside from the South dorm, which seems to be the one they highlight, housing is much less crowded for first years than it used to be.  After first year, the housing options are pretty great.  And it\u2019s hard to beat Hamilton when it comes to facilities management.

I would agree that based on vibe, those two are more similar and Oberlin and Bard should be taken out of the mix at this point.<br>On the most simple level, it seems sensible to choose Bates. It gave the best aid, and really, your talking about paying less for an equal school. It\u2019s a top LAC, the location is excellent, it has everything a student could want in terms of academics, activities, sports, and, let\u2019s not forget, food. The dorms are excellent. As far as I\u2019m aware, the dorms have all recently been redone. Except for singles, (even those are roomy) I\u2019ve never seen a bad dorm room, and some are beautiful. The campus is compact and lovely. The dining hall is outstanding, and the Den and the Ronj offer alternatives for when students want something different. The art museum is lovely, and the arts are well supported in general. Is everything at Bates glistening and modern? No. It is not a school of performing arts, but I can honestly tell you that I am always blown away by the level of talent I see when I am at Back to Bates weekends. I don\u2019t know how these kids do all that they do, and do it well.<br>The courses are great. My daughter has never felt that she has been forced to take a class she isn\u2019t interested in, and the requirements are very flexible. Short term in May is fun, and no one has better study abroad options than Bates. If study abroad is not possible, as it sometimes isn\u2019t due to major or double majoring, short term offers study abroad too.<br>The thing I like best about Bates is the students. I like how relaxed they are with each other. I like the guy in the flannel shirt hanging out with the hippie girl. Or the urbanite hanging with the science nerd. That\u2019s a little idealized, but my point is I never feel that there is one type of Bates student. My daughter is only a sample of one, but did not apply to Hamilton because she felt it was a little uptight and a little too preppy for her. Just her impression, because I liked Hamilton. I think many people agree though that Bates is known for being friendly and relaxed.<br>Your son shouldn\u2019t be concerned about choir and theater. There will be plenty of opportunities for him to be involved in performing arts. If he wants to sing something different, I\u2019m sure he will be able to do so.<br>As far as Maine, well, my daughter\u2019s best friends are from Hawaii, Florida and Tunisia.

But they go to the beach anyway, or they go snowboarding, or they go out in Portland, or they go running in the adjacent bird sanctuary, or hiking right off campus, or with the Bates Outing Club.

I think today he is trying on Hamilton as someone here suggested. He said he feels anxious after making the decision about Bates and does that mean it is the wrong decision. I said, there are no wrong decisions here. I feel anxious everytime I go on a trip, but I always end up having a great time! Someone just re introduced Bard as an option based on it actually being more academically challenging than Bates or Hamilton. I think my son noticed this when he attended the classes tho he like the things he attended at Bates.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Trixy34</b><br><br>@Lindagaf - after that, I want to go to Bates!  (And I\u2019m a Hamilton alum - lol!)<br><br>", "<b>Username: HCatmom</b><br><br>@gardenstategal  Yes, we have been over that. He has been singing with the best choir I have ever heard for the last 4 years. Hopefully the smallness doesn\u2019t also mean too many competeing for good parts, I guess it can go both ways. He is not the top talent anywhere, except maybe for his comedic roles.<br><br>", "<b>Username: HCatmom</b><br><br>I, personally love that program and would be in it in a minute if I were 18. I keep mentioning it to him!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Trixy34</b><br><br>Hm - Bard is more academically challenging?  Like, in a creativity sort of way? Heavier work load?  Students seemed more engaged?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>I believe Bates has about six a capella groups. Is he interested in that?<br>Each of those schools is going to be academically challenging. Kids don\u2019t get in if the colleges don\u2019t think they can handle the academics. Not one of them will be a good school for slackers. Not implying that your son is a slacker, of course.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>Regarding Hamilton, it potentially offers your son the most varied social options because of its spatial aspects. With three residential neighborhoods and five places to eat lunch, he could choose an essentially fluid experience based on where he lives and dines. In terms of academics, Hamilton\u2019s intellectualism probably runs a bit \u201ccooler\u201d than at a school such as Bard, so course selection would be key for the type of active engagement that he experienced there. In terms of intellectual capability as might be indicated by class standing and standardized scores, however, Hamilton falls at the top of his group. If Hamilton was located in Maine, for that matter, it would be the top school in the state by these measures.<br><br>", "<b>Username: chemusic</b><br><br>I agree with merc81.   The overall music program is stronger at Hamilton than at Bates if that is an important consideration.<br><br>", "<b>Username: apple23</b><br><br>I\u2019m not sure at all about the claim that Bates offers the best study abroad programs around. Bates approves programs such as Hamilton in France, Hamilton in Spain and Associated Colleges in China, which are all administered by Hamilton College. Bates\u2019 own abroad programs seem much less developed by comparison.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Trixy34</b><br><br>All that said, he\u2019s just \u201cfeeling\u201d Bates.  I think he should go to Bates.<br>Also, with so much choral talent at Hamilton, do we know he would make the choir if he\u2019s not a top talent?  @HCatmom - did you get a sense of that while on campus?  Meet with the choral director at all?<br><br>", "<b>Username: HCatmom</b><br><br>I am completely stunned that he is not choosing Hamilton or Oberlin for that matter. Bates was the last place he visited. So maybe thats it. Anyhow, he has, for better or worse, seemed to have chosen the one school that is the farthest away and the farthest North. EEEEEEWK! Thanks all.<br><br>", "<b>Username: HCatmom</b><br><br>Also, the one school his dad went to for the admitted student day instead of me.<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>Best of luck to your son at Bates, @HCatmom!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Lindagaf</b><br><br>Congratulations to your son! He\u2019s made a choice he\u2019ll be happy with.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sue22</b><br><br>Congratulations on your son for having made his decision. Time to buy the sweatshirt and never look back!<br><br>", "<b>Username: gardenstategal</b><br><br>^ @HCatmom , you should have devised your own microbrewery tour\u2026?<br><br>", "<b>Username: HCatmom</b><br><br>This was tough. I personally think i had to adjust letting go of Hamilton. It had always been his choice and we had been there 3 times. Starting to feel like home! Bates was the one college i didn\u2019t get to visit a 2nd time. So there will be alot of getting to know<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sue22</b><br><br>@HCatmom, feel free to head over to the Bates forum to ask any questions you may have about the college!<br><br>", "<b>Username: HCatmom</b><br><br>Where is the Bates forum?<br><br>", "<b>Username: merc81</b><br><br>You properly placed your other thread in the Bates forum, @HCatmom.
