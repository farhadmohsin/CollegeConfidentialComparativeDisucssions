You should choose between these two mainly based on fit. The pros for M&T are incredibly individualized attention and guidance while at Penn, both for academics and internships/jobs - There is an M&T office at Penn dedicated only to the M&T students with many counselors, administrators etc. Also the M&T alumni network is super close-knit and there are alumni events very often where you get to meet and network with M&T alumni. Because of the super strong ties of the M&T alumni network , its small size and how successful its grads are, it can be a huge asset in recruiting for top jobs etc. Also Pen has the strongest undergrad business program in the world.<br>The pros for Stanford ae that it is  overall more prestigious, recognizable name,  has better location and is stronger in engineering than Penn.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@Penn95 how is the campus at upenn compared to the others?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>From a architecture standpoint, I think Stanford has the nicest campus. I think for the other three it comes down to personal preference as to which one is the prettiest.<br>In terms of location and practicality I like  the Penn campus best. The campus is in a big but not overwhelmingly huge city (like NYC for example). So you got all the offerings of a major city without feeling overwhelmed. Also it is not right smack in the city center but rather a few minutes on foot away from the city center. Also despite being close to the city center, Penn has a defined and separate campus, so there is a campus feel and community (we call it the Penn Bubble)  so you get the best of both worlds.<br>Harvard is also in a major city but it gets way too touristy for my taste.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@Penn95 if you dont mind me asking, are you a student? I\u2019d have lots to ask aahahah<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>@mlunghi I am an alum. sure ask away.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@Penn95 is Upenn as well known as other Ivies? In terms of financial aid, how generous is it to international students?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>@mlunghi Depends which other ivies you are comparing it to and also what your intended audience is (i.e. to whom it is well known). To top employers and top grad school programs around the world Penn is very well known and highly regarded.  In fact Penn grads have the second highest salaries in the ivy league after Harvard and top employment outcomes, Penn is very heavily targeted by all the top firms, more so than some other ivies.<br>Now when you are talking about lay recognition, prestige, it depends which ivy you are comparing Penn to. Harvard is obviously the most famous university in the world. Every random person on the street knows what Harvard is and will be  impressed. Also Yale and Princeton have more name recognition than Penn by the average person on the street, but of course less than Harvard. But after HYP, Penn has just as good or better name recognition by the lay public as the rest of the ivies.<br>Specifically the Penn M&T program is extremely prestigious in sophisticated business/tech circles and people routinely turn down even Harvard, Stanford and MIT to attend.<br>Amongst the ivies, only HYP have need-blind financial aid for internationals because their endowments are much bigger than the rest of the ivies. All the other ivies are need-aware for international students. This means that applying for aid as an international will affect your chances of getting in since they have more limited funds for internationals. Still there are many top international students who get great financial aid awards from Penn and other non-HYP ivies.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@Penn95 would you advise taking out a loan then, or applying for financial aid? I do not think i would need huge amounts of aid, but certainly some would be very helpful.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>@mlunghi So you mean not applying for financial aid at all at Penn? How much would you need in loans or aid?<br><br>", "<b>Username: preppedparent</b><br><br>Berkeley is world ranked university. Great undergrad experience<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@Penn95 probably 40K in total for the 4 year degree, should I just take out a loan or is it worth applying for aid? I might even need less than that.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\u201cFor undergrad Berkeley is not exactly equivalent to Harvard, Stanford and Penn.\u201d<br>For undergrad, Cal is not exactly equivalent to Stanford and Harvard\u2026but then again, neither is Penn. Of course, both Cal and Penn can match Harvard and Stanford in their respective ways. For example, Cal\u2019s undergraduate Chemistry, Computer Science, Humanities and Engineering programs match those at Harvard and Stanford. Penn\u2019s Wharton Schoo, as well as its dual degree programs (Huntsman and Jerome Fisher) are truly exceptional, and impossible to beat for students interested in Business. But to suggest that Cal is inferior is way off base. Cal and and Penn are peers, and both are truly exceptional universities in their own way. They are admittedly very different from each other, and have their own strengths and limitations, but in terms of overall quality, they are in the same peer group.<br>mlunghi, you should be more specific. For example, in Silicon Valley, Cal and Stanford are extremely prestigious. On the East Coast, Harvard and Penn have the edge.<br>Also keep in mind that of those four universities, only Penn offers an Early Decision option. Harvard and Stanford have restrictive Early Action options and Cal does not have an Early Action/Early Decision plan.<br>Cal does not offer FA to international students, but it does scholarships to a lucky few. Honestly, I would not focus too much on Cal if you need a generous FA package. Harvard, Penn and Stanford all offer FA to international students, but Penn and Stanford are not known to be that generous with international FA. Dartmouth, Harvard and MIT are three that re typically more generous with international FA.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@Alexandre thank you very much for your reply! My main is to end up in technology startups, hence why I was looking at double degrees/majors in engineering and business. Harvard, Upenn, and Stanford would all allow me to do so. Do you think I should ED Upenn or wait for Harvard\u2019s EA? This is my current plan, haven\u2019t really looked at Darthmouth, how does it stack up against the rest?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>@Alexandre I don\u2019t think that is quite true. As a undergraduate school Berkeley is not exactly a peer to the ivies, stanford,MIT. It has to do with being a state school, having much more limited resources per students, much bigger undergrad student body, oversubscribed classes etc. But as an overall research university, i.e. in terms of research output and most of its grad schools, Berkeley is truly top notch. I feel for Berkeley there is a discrepancy between its standing for undergrad vs for grad schools. For undergrad rather few people turn down the most of  ivies, Stanford, MIT, Chicago, Duke etc for Berkeley.<br>Dartmouth has stopped being need bind for international students because it could not afford it anymore. it is need aware as are Penn and Stanford.<br>@mlunghi You should apply ED to your first choice. If you are happy committing to Penn and you won\u2019t regret it then sure go ahead, Penn favors its ED applicants quite a bit. But if you are going to regret not doing Harvard SCEA (there is no EA at Harvard), then you prob shouldn\u2019t ED at Penn.<br>Regarding the financial aid, while 40k over the entire 4 years is not huge, it is also not negligible. This is something you need to think very well yourself and also discuss with your parents. Yes applying to Penn and Stanford for financial aid will slightly lower your chances of getting admitted but getting loans is also a big decision, even if they are not too big. Maybe since you need FA, Harvard SCEA would be the better option since Harvard is need blind for internationals.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\u201cI don\u2019t think that is quite true. As a undergraduate school Berkeley is not exactly a peer to the ivies, stanford,MIT.\u201d<br>You think wrong Penn95. You should stick to what you know and leave university evaluations to the experts. They overwhelmingly agree that Cal is very much on par with Penn. What you and I think is irrelevant. Collectively, they know infinitely more than we do. We are literally ignoramuses compared to them. If you think otherwise (that you are wiser and better informed than hundreds of university presidents, provosts and undergraduate deans combined), you have delusions of grandeur.<br>\u201cIt has to do with being a state school, having much more limited resources per students, much bigger undergrad student body, oversubscribed classes etc.\u201d<br>State universities are not all lacking in resources. Michigan and UVa are as wealthy as private elites on a per student basis and they never have oversubscribed classes. Cal may not be quite as wealthy, but it is not hurting. Most of the claims against it are blown out of proportion. And let us not forget that Cal has no medical complex draining its resources. If one were to go on this metric, schools like Notre Dame and Rice would be world beaters\u2026certainly superior to Brown, Columbia, Cornell and Penn. But resources per student are not absolute. In fact, it is a well known fact in academic circles that the quality of an undergraduate institution cannot be captured, quantified or measured statistically. There are way too many variables, many of which are intangible, to assign a number to a university\u2019s overall excellence.<br>\u201cI feel for Berkeley there is a discrepancy between its standing for undergrad vs for grad schools.\u201d<br>There is definitely a discrepancy. At the graduate level, Cal is #1 or #2. I never claimed it was as good at the undergraduate level. But you make it seem like it is not on par with Penn. That is not accurate, only your opinion.<br>\u201cFor undergrad rather few people turn down the most of ivies, Stanford, MIT, Chicago, Duke etc for Berkeley.\u201d<br>Sadly, you are referring to highly misguided kids and their easily manipulated parents. You are quite right, most high school children and their parents are blinded by rankings which care only about sales and nothing for presenting a product that is grounded in fair, accurate, consistent and relevant information. Those in the know would not hesitate to choose Cal over schools like Chicago, Duke and Penn\u2026if it suits their personal preferences and academic interests of course. Admittedly, Cal is not for everyone. Indeed, most either love it or hate it (for the record, I was admitted into Cal, and disliked it when I visited it). But those who love it wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Incidentally, when it comes to people interested in either initiating a startup or working for one, Cal is hard to match\u2026let alone beat. But then again, so it Penn, and since Penn is more generous with FA than Cal, it obviously makes better sense for the OP to focus on Penn.<br>http://www.businessinsider.com/schools-most-vc-backed-entrepreneurs-2016-9<br>http://www.bestcolleges.com/features/top-colleges-for-startups/<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@Penn95 i honeslty do not even know if my family will be eligible for fa, what are upenn\u2019s requirements?

Cal is very good, but the only guarentee you\u2019ll have is whatever school/major you get in with and a business degree from Cal is a bit of a crap shoot.<br>At the end of the day all 3 will give you more resources than you can ever hope to use. The M&T, of course, gives you resources of 3 schools: Wharton, CEAS, CAS. Cal gives you the resources of a big, prestigious state school in shouting distance of Silicon Valley and Stanford gives you a suburban location that IS Silicon Valley.  Harvard is probably the international brand, lovely Boston location, hard to pick at it too much. Maybe just that Stanford and perhaps Haas are a touch more easier for Silicon Valley internships if that\u2019s your dream.<br>Pick your poison. You can\u2019t really go wrong.

Whether this general policy difference will make a significant difference in the OP\u2019s particular case is hard to say. They are all extremely selective even for US citizens. All 4 presumably are even more selective for international students. Berkeley, however, does not make institutional scholarship/grant aid available to international students (according to its 2015-16 Common Data Set, section H6).  So you might want to consider a less selective school (or even an equally selective one) that does offer financial aid to international students. The University of Illinois has respected CS and engineering programs and does offer some aid to internationals.  Many selective private universities grant fairly generous average aid amounts to the internationals they accept. For example at Cornell, for 2016-17, the average dollar amount of institutional financial aid awarded to undergraduate degree seeking nonresident aliens was $58,438 (according to its CDS).<br><br>", "<b>Username: tk21769</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>i honeslty do not even know if my family will be eligible for fa, what are upenn\u2019s requirements?<br>\"\"<br><br>For any college that interests you, you can get a rough idea of the net price (after aid) by running its online Net Price Calculator.

If it\u2019s a participating college that does not grant aid to internationals, expect it to return \u201c0\u201d as the estimated grant aid (even if your family income is quite low). For a college that does grant aid to internationals (like UPenn), the estimates don\u2019t seem to account for travel costs (as they do for out-of-state US citizens).  There may be other ways in which the NPC doesn\u2019t work as well for internationals as it does for US citizens.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>@Alexandre First of all you need to calm down, lose the attitude and watch how you talk to people\u2026secondly i am not going to waste my time convincing you of the obvious, it is rather rare for undergrad for people to choose Berkeley over the ivies, Stanford, MIT etc. That is a fact. It is also a fact that as a research university, it has a stronger reputation than all ivies other than Harvard and maybe Princeton. Berkeley grad/research and undergrad definitely do not have the same standing.<br>@CU123 It depends on what level of detail you are looking at. You know very well that the ivy league is much more than an athletic conference (most people dent even now it is an athletic conference). All ivies are more or less peers, but HYP are definitely more on par with each other than the rest of the ivies. But definitely for undergrad Dartmouth is more of a peer to HYP than Berkeley, If you want to get super anal about it than you could argue that Harvards true peer is Stanford, not Yale or Princeton. The ivy+ schools are essentially peers, of course not all of them have equal standing. Peers doesnt mean completely equivalent.<br>@mlunghi CS is strong at Penn. Sends many kids to top jobs and top grad schools and the program is rigorous with many cool courses.<br>Regarding financial aid, run the Penn NPC as mentioned above, but keep in mind it is primarily designed for US citizens.

In my opinion, high quality extends well beyond the top 10.  In many departments of most colleges across the top 50 (or even the top 100), the credentials of most professors who frequently teach undergrads would be virtually indistinguishable. Some research studies have shown that college selectivity/prestige per se, at least among the top 100 or 200 schools, makes little or no difference to lifetime earnings of most graduates.<br>On the other hand, the higher-ranked schools generally are wealthier schools that can afford to grant more financial aid. Among universities in the US News top 20, apparently only Berkeley (#20) does not grant aid to internationals. In the next 10 (21-30), several do not grant aid to internationals. As you get into the next 10 after that (31-40), you begin to see universities (like NYU) that aren\u2019t very generous with aid even to US citizens. Among the US News \u201cnational universities\u201d, as far as I know, none ranked lower (worse) than Boston College (#31) even claims to meet 100% of demonstrated need for US citizens. A highly qualified individual may get a big need-based aid package at some lower-ranked schools \u2026 and top students certainly can get big merit scholarships at some much lower ranked schools.  However, it may make sense for a very strong international student with high need to focus on the top 40 or so, then search for true safeties in your home country.  I think the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle of that band (like, #11-#31).  The top 10 are admission crap shoots; in the lower 10 (#32-40), n-b aid to internationals may be insufficient.<br>For what you seem to want and need, it may make sense to consider Brown, Cornell, Harvey Mudd College (which is sort of a mini MIT), Northwestern, Rice, Tufts, the University of Southern California, Vanderbilt, and Washington University in St. Louis. These are all rich, selective, prestigious schools with strong STEM programs. As far as I know they all offer generous need based aid packages to internationals. However, they are not quite the admission crap shoots that Stanford and Harvard are (although a few come close). A bit less selective, but still very good:  URochester, Brandeis, Case Western Reserve University, Northeastern, Rensselaer, and Lehigh.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Alexandre</b><br><br>\u201cFirst of all you need to calm down, lose the attitude and watch how you talk to people\u2026\u201d<br>Penn95, you insult 500,000 Cal alumni by claiming that Penn is superior to Cal, and I am the one with an attitude?   Did you stop and think how your words affect others? I am sure you do not appreciate it when others tell you that Chicago or Columbia are superior to Penn when there is no real evidence, other than statistical data, to support their claims. Try putting yourself in the shoes of others before you debase their alma matter. All I said is that you should not pass opinion as fact. That certainly goes for me too, and I am guilty of doing so from time to time. We really have nowhere near the experience, information or visibility into those matters as does the collective of university presidents, provosts and deans of undergraduate colleges.

I am rather a reasonable person Penn95. If something is obvious or logical, I will wholeheartedly embrace it. You are basing part of your argument on the decision made by 17-18 year old high school kids. It hardly proves that Cal is not as good an undergraduate institution. There are many reasons why people may choose Ivy League schools over Cal. Better financial aid, ED commitments, legacy status, desire to move away from home, etc\u2026That does not mean the undergraduate education received at Penn is superior to the one received at Cal.<br>I think there are two schools of thought when it comes to determining the quality of a university. One is grounded in the belief that the quality of an undergraduate education can be captured through a series of data points\u2026that there is a statistical equation that can, with a degree of accuracy, predict the quality of a university\u2019s undergraduate quality. Most high school students and parents like the statistical approach because it is tangible. The second is grounded in the belief that the quality of an undergraduate education cannot be captured statistically. In general, most members of academe do not ascribe to a one-size-fits-all statistical methodology. The article written by Gerhard Casper, a Yale educated Law scholar who served as Dean of the University of Chicago Law School (1977-1987), Provost of the University of Chicago (1987-1992) and President of Stanford University from 1992-2000) articulated what most members of the academic community feel, both about Cal being a top undergraduate institution, and about basing rankings on statistics.<br>https://web.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970418usnews.html<br>\u201cIt is also a fact that as a research university, it has a stronger reputation than all ivies other than Harvard and maybe Princeton.

I have said as much already. When it comes to graduate programs, not including MBA or Law School, the only Ivy on par with Cal is Harvard. But Cal\u2019s graduate programs are in a different league to Penn undergrad, or Northwestern undergrad, or Brown undergrad, or Michigan undergrad, or Cornell undergrad or Duke undergrad etc\u2026Cal\u2019s graduate programs are generally considered among the top 3 in the nation, along with Harvard and Stanford. Caltech ad MIT match Cal in the sciences and Princeton and Yale match Cal in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Clearly, Cal is exceptional at the graduate level, and it is a notch below at the undergraduate level. That does not mean that Cal undergrad is weaker than Penn undergrad. There is no evidence that the undergraduate education received at Penn is superior to the undergraduate education received at Cal.<br><br>", "<b>Username: moscott</b><br><br>@stevensPR   Parchment is a viable resource available to compare colleges like it or not. It\u2019s not even close(81-19). Heck Berkeley only has a 58-42 vs UCLA. Do you have another source citing otherwise?<br><br>", "<b>Username: CaliDad2020</b><br><br>@mlunghi<br>If you are asking about my 75%/50% numbers those refer to the \u201cadmissions stats\u201d of the schools. Most schools report to the \u201ccommon data set\u201d their acceptance stats, including the range of SAT and/or ACT scores. They report them as 25-75% (Basically if the school accepted 1000 students 250 have scores under the \u201clow\u201d number (usually athletes, alumni kids, other special admits for very unique other reasons than test scores) and 250 have above the \u201chigh\u201d number (that\u2019s where you want to be to feel you have a decent shot, although schools reject kids with top test scores all the time if the rest of their application is not interesting to the school.)<br>So Penn, for instance has a \u201cbasic\u201d reported ACT 25-75 rangeof 32-35 (this # is actually their attending students which is a bit different than admitted students but close enough for jazz). Now, be aware this is for the entire undergrad university population. CAS (College of Arts & Sciences) and Undergrad Nursing will generally be tiny a bit lower on average, CEAS (Eng) and Wharton at the upper edge of this range and M&T (Jerome Fisher) will likely require (all else being equal) the very top range 35-36.<br>Basically, if you have less than a 33 on the ACT, and no really strong standout (and I mean by standout, really top notch, not just \u201cbest at my school\u201d but \u201cBest in City/State/Area/Country\u201d) special skill/achievement, you\u2019re going to need perfect grades, amazing recs, a pulitzer-level essay and a bit of luck to get into Penn.  30,000 students in the US score 33+ on the ACT each year. Add students who only take SAT and do well and there is a decent sized pool of strong test-takers out there for the Penn, Stanford, Harvard, Cal to select from.<br>(for reference Harvard reports a 25-75% ACT of 31-35, MIT 33-35, Cal 30-34)<br>But you have to look at that number not as \u201cA 33 will get me in\u201d but as \u201cif I have less than a 33 I\u2019m unlikely to even be competitive.\u201d<br>Then you have to look at programs. One of my kids, for instance, had a 33 ACT, significant college research in a competitive program, good grades, lots of APs, etc. etc. and did not get into Cal. But she applied to an engineering major and at Cal the engineering is more competitive than the general L&S school. So, if you were interested in CS, for instance, you can apply to Cal Engineering CSEE, which is extra extremely competiitve, or just to Cal LibArts school to study CS, which is \u201cjust\u201d extremely competitive.<br>Again, schools like Stanford, Harvard, Penn, Cal have very low admission % They are taking 6 or 7 or 12% of the applicants - and most applicants have already self-selected to at least be close to that 25-75 range. Not a lot of kids with 26 ACT scores or 3.5 GPA are wasting the time writing a Stanford or Penn supplimental essay. It is kids with 30, 31 and up. And still 1 in 10 get in. Also be aware Penn, for instance, takes a good % of its class as early admits, so if you are in the regular pool your chances go down further. Again CEAS and Wharton are even more competitive and M&T is perhaps the most competitive of all Penn undergrad programs.<br>Hope this helps. Let me know if  you need further info. But it is very dangerous, if you really want to go to a US school, to only have &lt;20% admit rate schools on your list. Penty of very smart and accomplished US students make this mistake every year and end up sweating wait-lists or having to scramble for a last minute option. If you understand math at all, you\u2019ll realize the issue. UCLA got 100k apps last year. Harvard got ~ 40k for ~2k admits\u2026 etc.<br>(oh and PS, ignore @Penn95 and @Alexandre that\u2019s just what happens when you go to a decent US school that isn\u2019t Harvard or Stanford! lol\u2026)<br><br>", "<b>Username: ucbalumnus</b><br><br><br><br><br> mlunghi:<br>\"\"<br>I want to study economics/finance and computer science/engineering, so i looked for schools that did so.<br>\"\"<br><br>You may want to consider whether doing full majors in CS/E and business is really worth the trouble compared to doing CS/E with some out-of-major electives in economics and finance.<br>For elitist employment list Wall Street and consulting, school prestige is a big deal, regardless of major (note that many of the targeted high-prestige schools do not offer business majors).

For example, Penn was favored over Cornell by an 87-13 advantage (worse than Cal), over Northwestern by an 88-12 advantage\u2026and even over Brown by a 66-33 advantage. Perhaps a disproportionate number of applicants were interested specifically in Wharton, which would make sense.

She was in SEAS as a CS major and doing very well. She needed to decide whether to apply to M & T or to stay in SEAS and expand her knowledge base.<br>I really don\u2019t think that there is a right or wrong answer. In her experience, the M & T students tend to be very talented and have some valuable skills that many in CS are not very good at. For example, approaching a potential new product with a lot of focus on understanding the current market, and how this potential product\u2019s characteristics compared to the competition. How is it different and better? What do customers want and need that they are not getting. How can we add those features?<br>They also are very skilled at marketing. In CS group projects she has observed that often an M & Ter will volunteer to prepare the presentation slides. At times she has been surprised at how impressive a thoughtful marketing person was able to make their product sound with a slick, visually appealing presentation and customer focus. Those are really valuable skills. Also, she has learned that the formality of a meeting where a finance team is presenting to investors often stands in sharp contrast to what passes for work attire and behavior in Silicon Valley. They sit up straight, the all wear nice suits, hair and makeup are perfect, everyone behaves very formally, they are incredibly well prepared, they are very careful not to interrupt potential investors/clients etc. Just the fact that as a SEAS student she has had the opportunity to observe all of this from her Wharton and M & T friends at a young age is really valuable in my opinion, and she clearly sees the value in these skills. To me it shows real value in the way Penn jumbles students together from all four schools. They all learn valuable things from one another.<br>However, she decided in the end that her primary focus, at least for now, would be more on technology and less on the finance and business aspects. She would not say that this is a better path than M & T, just better for her.<br>Instead of applying to M & T, she applied to a specialized CS program that is more focused on issues of connectivity, scaling, and systems engineering, and requires a bit more math and economics than your typical CS undergrad (www.nets.upenn.edu/). I know you will look it up if I don\u2019t attach it. lol  The strong economics requirements bolster her economics knowledge as you mentioned. Then, to further bolster her depth of technology knowledge, at the end of sophomore year, she applied and was accepted as a sub-matriculant into the CS masters program. https://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/degrees/submatriculation.php<br>She is now splitting her course load between grad and undergrad courses, and hoping to graduate next May with a BSE and an MSE on the same weekend. If she is not able to manage the course load to do that, she will be one course short of her MSE at that time.<br>I should add that both the special program and the sub-mat require special applications, and the courses are difficult. Neither her path nor the M & T route are viable for an average student. Still they are both there and available for the right student who is bright, works hard and loves a challenge. While I don\u2019t think there is a lot of initial monetary value in having the MSE over a BSE in CS, I do think the added depth of knowledge and experience with increased experience with significant projects is a valuable use of her time.<br><br>", "<b>Username: mlunghi</b><br><br>@ucbalumnus why would it be bad to employers?
