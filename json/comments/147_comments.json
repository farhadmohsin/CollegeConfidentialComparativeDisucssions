I\u2019m still undecided as to what exactly I want to major in, but for all of these schools I was accepted for a subject in the Humanities. I\u2019m thinking of majoring in History as I am considering going to law school after undergrad, with a potential double major/minor in Government/Political Science, or some other subject like Literature or Philosophy. Alternatively I\u2019m also thinking of studying Economics along with Statistics/Data Science if I decide I\u2019d rather not go to law school.<br>Additional Info -<br>I\u2019m leaning Cornell mainly because of the name brand/recognition - even though it\u2019s considered the \u201cjoke\u201d of the Ivy League, it\u2019s still an Ivy League and that alone could open up a lot of doors for me, which may be crucial as a Humanities/Social Sciences major. I\u2019ve also read that Cornell is more highly regarded in the international community than it is in the U.S. alone, so that could help if I decide to study abroad (which I would like to do). Being in the middle of nowhere isn\u2019t a big issue for me, and I\u2019m not bothered by the cold/snow (although truthfully I\u2019ve never lived anywhere where it\u2019s constantly below 30 degrees on a daily basis) - what I\u2019m really worried about is potentially becoming really depressed due to the combination of the isolation/cold plus being so far away from my family, and mental health (from what I\u2019ve heard) is already a bit of an issue at Cornell since academics are notoriously difficult and stressful at Cornell, and I\u2019m worried that if I go to Cornell I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019m always in a state of homesickness/stress while being surrounded by people who feel the same. Johns Hopkins from what I\u2019ve seen doesn\u2019t have the strongest programs in the Humanities but it\u2019s another prestigious university that\u2019s offering to pay for everything so I\u2019m definitely not going to count it out anytime soon. USC is the closest to home (close enough to where I can stay at home on weekends if I want, and driving up for family events/parties would not be an issue at all) and it\u2019s where my family wants me to go to school. It\u2019s a bit more expensive than the other universities, however, and I\u2019d have to take out a loan to pay off the remaining cost and I would have to work a little bit more to pay for work-study than if I went to Cornell of JHU. Being the heart of LA is useful for finding jobs and internships, but the traffic is really annoying and the surrounding area is another turn-off. Additionally, I\u2019m not sure if I like the \u201cvibe\u201d of USC - I\u2019ve visited multiple times, and I was definitely able to feel that party culture that is pretty dominant at USC, and as an introvert I\u2019m really not into that type of stuff, so I don\u2019t want to go to a school where I feel like I\u2019d be an outcast just because I don\u2019t like to party or go to football games every weekend. My college counselor has been talking to me about Emory and she seems to be pushing me in that direction (I got into both the Emory and Oxford colleges), and the Humanities seem to be pretty strong, but they still haven\u2019t sent me their FA packet and I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll have to chance to visit the campus.<br>In terms of activities, I\u2019m hoping to join some type of community service or volunteer organization, and I\u2019d like to work on campus as either a tour guide or a peer consultant. I did marching band in high school, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to continue doing it in college. I also did competitive color guard throughout my high school career, but none of these schools have competitive color guard teams, so if I wanted to keep doing it I would have to join an independent group which cost a lot of $$$$$ and time.<br>I\u2019m planning to visit Cornell over spring break, and hopefully I\u2019ll be able to visit JHU\u2019s campus after that as well. I\u2019ve been to USC multiple times, and like I said I don\u2019t know when/if I\u2019ll have a chance to visit Emory\u2019s campus.<br>Overall, I\u2019m leaning Cornell/USC right now, but maybe that\u2019s just because I don\u2019t know enough about JHU/Emory to appreciate them as much.<br><br>", "<b>Username: momofsenior1</b><br><br>JHU is in the middle of Baltimore.

USC is a really great school and I have a feeling I\u2019d be better off staying close to home/family/friends, but it\u2019s tough to turn up offers from schools like Cornell, JHU, and Emory. Thanks for the advice.<br>@collegemom3717 I applied because I have family in Baltimore, and because at the time I was still undecided as to what I wanted to do. Their generous financial aid was another draw, too. If it looks like I\u2019m going off of stereotypes, that\u2019s because I don\u2019t have much else to work with. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ll be visiting the campuses soon.

If it looks like I\u2019m being reserved about the school, it\u2019s because I am - I\u2019ve never visited, and it\u2019s thousands of miles away from home. Out of all the schools, I\u2019m probably leaning Cornell the most, but I don\u2019t want to get myself overly excited and then disappoint myself if I have to turn down the offer because I realize the campus\u2019s location and weather isn\u2019t for me.<br>Thanks for the comments everyone.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Happytimes2001</b><br><br>Actually Cornell is not well known at all in those fields. JHU has an excellent world renown IR program. It\u2019s highly regarded in the diplomatic, strategic and other fields. Did you look at SAIS?

While Cornell is a very well known school for good reason, the areas you cited aren\u2019t the strongest fields. And Cornell isn\u2019t as strong outside the US as any of the other Ivies. So, if you end up in international studies of some type, you aren\u2019t going to have the same connections that someone at JHU or Georgetown would.<br>I\u2019d suggest you look at the actual majors you are interested in and how they rank at the various schools rather than just looking at the schools.

A lot of information I have about college has come from my college counselor and she never really talked to me about Johns Hopkins and its Social Sciences/Humanities. I guess it\u2019s my fault for not being more aggressive about the research process and I probably shouldn\u2019t have trusted her word as much as I did.  Admittedly when I was a sophomore I was pretty much set on studying IR but my passion shifted more towards History/Economics since I\u2019m interested in the possibility of either law school or academia after I graduate. This is good to know, though, thank you for the information.<br>Main reason I would pay more for USC than any other school is so that I could stay close to home and remain in California. A lot of people don\u2019t really take this into consideration when I give the differences in offers but USC is 45 minutes away from my house (in good traffic) and as someone who has never lived away from home for a long period of time, it\u2019s hard for both me and my family to push USC aside just because it\u2019s a bit more expensive.

Going to college is the best way to learn about yourself and gain confidence. Being away from home, you will have to rely on making new friends, learning from others and integrating into the community. Even in a diverse university like USC, a new area will allow you to fully embrace a new experience. I do realize that many students stay close.

At some private schools, the wealthy gap is noticeable and can be uncomfortable (think Columbia and NYU kids living high in Manhattan).<br>Of course, that\u2019s what\u2019s great about Ithaca and Baltimore, not too many places in either locale that require extra money to visit.

For East Asian Studies, there is a similar SAIS study abroad program in China<br>From the website re: SAIS-Bologna:<br>\"Motivated international studies and political science majors\u2026may apply to spend their junior year or a semester at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) Bologna Center in Italy.<br>\u2026students apply in the second semester of their sophomore year for the year abroad program.\"<br>Credits earned in the SAIS - Bologna program can get advanced credit if they end up doing the MA program.<br><br>", "<b>Username: happymomof1</b><br><br>If you have such significant need that both CU and JHU have offeredfull rides (tuition, fees, housing, meals) then my guess is that your family can\u2019t truly afford USC.  Remember, you an only borrow the standard federal loans on your own.  Any debt beyond that would need a cosigner.<br>CU has several divisions that are state affiliated, and attract a fair number of in-state students whose families are in financial situations similar to yours.  So don\u2019t worry about being the only one in your dorm who is counting their pennies to make sure they can pay for their share of a pizza.  You are smart to be concerned about the weather.  Winters are long, dark, and snowy.  They also will be cold by your standards.  Summers are gorgeous, but most undergrads aren\u2019t around then.  I like the wide variety of programs (and consequently students) at CU.  Yes you could switch into CALS or ILR or HUMEC if you suddenly decided to.  But again, the winter and travel costs need to be taken into consideration.<br>JHU is easier to get to as others have pointed out.  Historically, it has had an excellent reputation in the humanities, and has had a good track record for getting students into graduate or professional school.  You nedn\u2019t worry about that.  The winter is definitely milder than at CU, but still might be cold by your standards.  I\u2019m not familiar with the JHU campus, but Happykid graduated from Towson U in the Baltimore suburbs, and really enjoyed the time she spent in the city.<br>Fingers crossed that when you visit you will know which can be a good home for you for the next four years!<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>Full ride to  Cornell and JHU are like winning the educational lottery.

Attending those universities at a highly discounted price is an opportunity that nobody should pass up. Where it matters most, they are as prestigious as they come. No educated adult, especially one in a position to admit you into a graduate program or hire you into a company, would associate Cornell or JHU with the word \u201cjoke\u201d. In fact, those two universities are pressure cookers, known for their uncompromising academic standards. I would explore there respective offerings and campus cultures and pick the one that fits you best.<br><br>", "<b>Username: monydad</b><br><br>IMO most of the \u201cpressure cooker\u201d reputation  (at both schools, probably) comes from the sciences & engineering.

Maybe they just have better manners\u2026<br>FWIW my D2 was a humanities major at Cornell, and worked very hard there. However, while she was doing that, she also had part-time jobs, extra-curricular involvements and an active social life. She did well academically too.

I got my PhD in History, and I can assure you that the department was and continues to be excellent and highly ranked.  Also strong are Political Science, English, Philosophy, and Creative Writing.  Internationally renowned scholars circulate through on a regular basis.  There are also weekly seminars where leading researchers circulated works in progress in advance for discussion and debate.<br>While the average person on the street will think \u201cHopkins - medicine,\u201d law schools and grad schools know the worth of a JHU humanities/social sciences diploma.<br>As you are interested in community service, I also can assure you that ample opportunities await you in Baltimore.<br>As mentioned previously, getting in and out of Baltimore will be easier from the west coast than Ithaca, which will involve more regional airports and weather-related delays and cancelations at some point over the course of four years.  Is that enough to discount Cornell?  Of course not.  But it\u2019s a point worth considering, given that you have some concerns about being far from home.<br>Basically, you have four strong options before you.  I do not know USC\u2019s history program well but both Cornell and Emory also have large, diverse History programs with distinguished faculty and frequent guest lecturers.

I was very surprised about how strong JHU\u2019s humanities programs are.

I love Cornell and Ithaca, but it\u2019s not to everyone\u2019s taste. I did not push my D toward Cornell because it\u2019s really in the middle of nowhere and dark, cold, and snowy in winter; she wanted an urban area after growing up in rural Washington. That said, Ithaca is a fun, vibrant college town, and my impression is that Cornell has an excellent history program. Your proximity to DC at JHU would be a big bonus, though.
