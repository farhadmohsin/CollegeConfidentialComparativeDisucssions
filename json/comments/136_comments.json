Our son was offered the Stamps scholarship at Wake Forest. Even with offers from Duke and Vandy, it looked like Wake and the scholarship would be the choice. But then came the Stanford acceptance. That has presented a huge decision.

Wake is a great school with solid opportunities.<br>On the other hand, Stanford is Stanford. I feel like the opportunities presented by Stanford are unparalleled.<br>This is a classic money vs prestige scenario that is a great problem to have - I realize that. I\u2019d just appreciate any thoughts from this forum. Thanks in advance.<br><br>", "<b>Username: rickle1</b><br><br>Wow - congrats on all these wonderful acceptances. What an accomplishment! I frequently tell (when asked) my friends that competitive merit aid at highly selective, need blind schools is really designed to pick off the ones that would otherwise go to Harvard or Stanford. Your son is one of \u201cthe ones\u201d and that is an amazingly small crowd. It\u2019s Wake\u2019s version of the Jefferson Scholars program at UVA or Cornelius at Vandy, etc.<br>S attends Wake (sophomore). I can tell you it\u2019s an amazing place and provides a top notch education. It\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s been rated among the top schools for undergraduate teaching for many years (like in the top 10). Small discussion based classes taught by leading profs is the norm. Great well rounded liberal arts core and excellent majors / outcomes in business, compsci, pre med, pre law, etc. You can get anywhere from Wake Forest!<br>But\u2026\u201cStanford is Stanford\u201d. For example, if your son wanted to pursue the incredibly competitive world of management consulting out of UG, MBB lives at Stanford. That\u2019s just one, but a good, example. I imagine the opportunities in Silicon Valley are incredible!!! That makes a difference. Think about your financial resources. Would it make a major difference in your life if you were to pay for Stanford? Can you pay for it out of cash flow? Do you have a ton of home equity AND you were considering downsizing anyway?<br>I ask these questions out of experience. Although our choices were different than yours, we were in a similar position. Essentially free state flagship at a popular prestigious school or full pay at Wake (what we narrowed our choices to). I have been saving for college for a LONG time and earn a good living. We have also been saving for retirement for a long time. My basic MO is, other than in case of emergency, our retirement savings will never be touched for anything other than our retirement. So using it for school was/is not an option. However, between earmarked college savings and cash flow, we could/can afford full pay. Do I like it? No. Would I prefer to not pay it? Yes. But\u2026that\u2019s why we saved\u2026for that exact purpose - to be able to provide a profound opportunity for my son (and his sister in a yr). We\u2019re not going in to debt, just using existing resources. Based on my conservative calculations, we\u2019ll have plenty for retirement, so not spending the money would mean simply having more (which might be nice - pay for additional trips / memories) but we decided it\u2019s also fun to use it for Wake and X and see those memories happen in real time. Of course, it was a personal decision. I would not have chosen it if it required substantial debt on anyone\u2019s part. S is taking the unsubsidized Stafford loans as we required him to have some skin in the game but that will easily be paid back and quickly once he starts his career.<br>I hope this helps provide clarity in your thinking. Best of luck, and congratulations. You must be proud!<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>From a purely ROI perspective, it\u2019s hard to justify Stanford. $300K grows to $2.1M in 40 years even at a pretty conservative 5% real return rate.<br>And Stamps would offer a lot of opportunities and open a lot of doors as well.<br>What opportunities would he get at Stanford that he wouldn\u2019t get with Wake with Stamps?<br>Even if you spend the money, it\u2019s the difference between Stanford or Wake + a free (elite, assuming he gets in) MBA or other master\u2019s + funded travels all over the world and still a little left over to start a nest egg.<br>Though I would make sure that he and the younger daughter get the same amount of money (taking in to account inflation) to spend on education or other enriching pursuits (hence why I would fund travel but not a car if he chooses Wake).<br><br>", "<b>Username: Creekland</b><br><br>We had a young lass from our school in the exact same situation a couple of years back, though she was also considering full rides at U Miami and Vandy (3 options or Stanford - dream school).

There was also another lass applying there - not sure if she attended - due to her experience.<br>YMMV  I\u2019m just relating her experience.<br><br>", "<b>Username: PurpleTitan</b><br><br>^ OK, I saw a response. Yes, being by Silicon Valley with a Stanford degree opens doors. On the other hand, a Stanford MBA also opens doors (to MC, etc.). Probably more than undergrad Stanford.

Yes, he would have to get in, but given his current trajectory, he has a good shot (at least at getting in to an M7 b-school, who are the top targets for MC).<br><br>", "<b>Username: rickle1</b><br><br>^ I agree the Stamps / Wake make it a tough decision.

Wake is a GREAT place and provides a GREAT education and opportunities.<br>It\u2019s an interesting quandary. I\u2019m a financial advisor by trade. Over the years (30), I\u2019ve learned that financial planning / advising is more about client issues / vision/ concerns than the actual money. The money is just a resource. I think of it like the junction between the human element and math. The math part is ridiculously easy. The human element part is very challenging (and interesting), as everyone is so unique.

Be honest with yourself about those numbers.<br>You are incredibly fortunate to have resources that would allow you to give your son this option.  It truly is OK for you to do so if he decides that he prefers Stanford.

So who knows if grad school is even in the cards. But assuming it is, let\u2019s not discount the chance of grad school sponsoring or scholarship. Clearly he is an amazing student. Assuming his trajectory continues, he\u2019ll still be an amazing student. Many in that category have grad school paid for by employer or via scholarship.

There\u2019s also the bragging rights that come along with attending Stanford that would tip the scale a bit further towards attending Stanford if I was in that situation.

He may well want to save the money for his future studies.

She is over the moon there and we are blown away by the opportunities she has had; she doesn\u2019t regret her decision for a second and neither do we.<br>That said, D is an only child so there are no other children to send to college. Retirement will be covered through savings and a generous pension plan (a rarity these days!). We are comfortably upper middle class (what might be described as \u201cdonut hole\u201d family on CC.)

If they plan to go into some careers, it will matter. If they plan to study something that isn\u2019t germane to making money or earning a high income due to a knowledge career, then that\u2019s another path.<br>Some kids want to study a subject in which the job opportunities are not altogether that lucrative. Others want to go into a career where you are evaluated based on your knowledge ( part of which is your education). Try selling WF to a client in some fields. Then try selling Stanford.

Personal choice. $300 K over the course of a career ( if you do the math and think it\u2019s worth 7ishK per annum). My experience has demonstrated that those with a top education often earn far more than those with a standard/good education. ( In all the fields I have worked in that translated into far more than 7K per annum). Again depends on the fields OP pursues. Also, this doesn\u2019t appear to be the case where a kid takes on so much debt that they are burdened for two decades. The parents have resources.<br>In terms of post graduate, it really depends on the program. The student might pursue a Phd and cost will be negligible, or they might pursue an MBA which might be very costly. Again, begin with a plan and you will have different results.<br><br>", "<b>Username: roycroftmom</b><br><br>I appreciate your insight, happytimes2001, but you base it up on the assumption that of course there will be career differences based on college choice. For a very few, that may be true. But 394 Stanford students were rejected from Mckinsey offers that year, and they probably did accept someone somewhere who went to WF. It is just not the case that 400, or even 40 Stanford kids will end up at McKinsey-4 kids accepted their offers that year. So for a few, it may matter, but they likely will end up in the same place regardless, usually sorrounded by people who attended \u201clesser\u201d schools. I know of no workplace or grad school composed exclusively of HYPSM grads, and all schools have different strengths and weaknesses. A different relative attends a small school far down the prestige chain from these schools, but that college runs circles around HYPSM in career prep and services for their students. Being the best, overall, does not mean the best in everything nor the best for your student.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Happytimes2001</b><br><br>@roycroftmom Good points. I think it does depend on career choices. But it extends beyond Mckinsey and the consulting world. ( Though that world is replete with people from the same schools). I actually did work in a company that only hired HYPSM grads and it wasn\u2019t pretty. (MIT on the tech side and another school on the business side-turned into a study in dysfunction).<br>Every kid and parent wants different things. Ideally, I think fit is very important. For the intellectual kid, the resources at a place like Stanford are going to be pervasive rather than a group of select scholars. That means something.

Ds received a full-ride at one school that had a Stamps, but he did not receive the Stamps there.  He also received merit at a T20 - not full tuition but sizeable/significant. When he narrowed his choices, his top three were one of the full rides, the T20 offering merit, and Stanford at full-pay.  Without knowing how much your \u201c+\u201d is over your income of $300K, we were similiarly situated to you financially, though we had about $230K saved and ds is our only. The full ride at the lower-ranked school had a program in a field that ds was strongly interested in at the time.  Stanford had been and was the dream school, but my ds is pretty pragmatic.  He somehow developed a spreadsheet with weighted factors for pros and cons for each of his top three choices and each school was \u201cscored.\u201d We used what I call the \u201cpile approach.\u201d  The monies we had saved were ds\u2019s \u201cpile.\u201d  He could use that $230K as he saw fit to fund his education.  If he chose full-pay at Stanford, that was going to suck up the entire pile (we were fine with covering the other $30-$35K needed over the four years he would attend).  If there was money left in the pile at the end of his undergrad (because he chose one of the lower-priced options), the remaining balance was for him to use for grad school or travel or any other reasonable expenditures (save, car, toward a house purchase, etc). He knew going in that if he chose Stanford he would be on his own for graduate school should he pursue that.  Med school was never on his radar.<br>Ds chose Stanford. There have been many allusions on here to certain career paths, post-graduate plans.  Since you have not stated what those might be for your ds, I do think it makes it more difficult for folks to weigh in.  Ds is now in MBB consulting, and I agree with others that for certain (narrow) fields where one attends undergrad matters.  I also agree with the poster that attending one of those undergrad schools certainly does NOT guarantee a pathway into one of those fields.  The competition is strong, and the number of actual hires is few, at least for MBB consulting (not sure about banking). The opportunity is there for his firm to cover tuition plus some living expenses for an MBA under certain circumstances.  They won\u2019t cover it just anywhere.  I am not sure of all the ins and outs of how it works, but that is now his circus, not mine.<br>I never understand the \u201che can go there for grad school\u201d statements.  That is not guaranteed.  Of course, without knowing your ds\u2019s plans, whether or not grad school needs to be factored in is an unknown.<br>Your ds is clearly an intelligent young man. I understand wanting to guide him and get all the perspectives that you can.  But, IMO, it is ultimately his decision.  Tell him his \u201cpile\u201d amount and stop talking about it to him. Give him some space to ponder.  He still has a month to decide.  He needs to own whatever he decides.  Revisit (or visit) both schools if possible. It took my ds about a week to reach his conclusion, and it was really hard for me not to talk about it/ask what he was thinking over and over again.  If your ds wants your views, he\u2019ll ask.  If the pile for Stanford doesn\u2019t work because of little sister, then take it off the table.<br>As someone who is an only child and who has an only child I am probably not the best to weigh in on equity among siblings.  Providing BOTH of your children with a debt-free undergraduate degree seems \u201cfair,\u201d to me.

Only you can know how much you can save for little sister over the next four years. Only you can know the family dynamics of fairness and equity and what that means in your household.  To me, making sure the dollar amount is even is irrelevant, but obviously others differ and believe each \u201cpile\u201d should be exactly the same.<br>All the best to your ds as he decides.

The vast majority of full pay kids admitted to Stanford or comparable could likely could have gotten a near full ride at another quality college,  yet they choose to attend the highly selective college instead.  And there are also plenty of kids who choose the near free college with a merit scholarship over HYPSM\u2026 (usually by not applying to a highly selective college) and think it would be ridiculous to spend $70k+/year when they can get something similar near free.  Neither one is automatically correct or incorrect.<br>I attended Stanford and think it was a great school.  Had I attended Wake Forest instead, I believe my life outcome would have been completely different\u2026 not so much because of the prestige of the degree name, but more intangibles.

The idea of the program was to foster tech entrepreneurship by combining studying tech with studying business.   I doubt that WF offers anything similar.  While in this program, I heard about a lot of success stories, was able to meet one of the founders of Yahoo, and had other unique opportunities.  This likely contributed to me choosing to start my own small Internet company, which quickly became a larger source of income than my engineering day job.  I doubt this would have happened had I attended WF.<br>I grew up in NYS and enjoyed the CA climate and lifestyle so much that I favored living in CA, which fit well with the vast majority of recruiters attending career fairs being from CA.  This relates to me living in CA today.  Had I attended WF, I probably would have been living in a different area of the country, likely NC.   I have family in NC and also enjoy that area, particularly closer to OBX and the Smoky Mountains.

No school comes with guarantees.<br>What is true is that the money you\u2019ll spend has opportunity cost. If you were to invest the $300,000 more that it\u2019ll cost for a full pay program over a free program, at 7% over 40 years, you\u2019ll have over $4M. That\u2019s how much BETTER the full pay program will have to be to break even.<br>Now, that\u2019s not to say that you should always choose the cheapest option. On a pure financial basis though, no full pay school pays as an investment compared to free, not even Stanford, even if the full pay school comes with more opportunity.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Rivet2000</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>If you were to invest the $300,000 more that it\u2019ll cost for a full pay program over a free program, at 7% over 40 years, you\u2019ll have over $4M.<br>\"\"<br><br>Or the market could tank and you could loose all that money\u2026 <br><br>", "<b>Username: eyemgh</b><br><br>@Rivet2000, if the market tanked for over 40 years, we\u2019d have more concerns than where we went to college. Remember, even if you invested the day before any previous crash, including 1929, you made money, LOTS of money, by simply holding on. We are comparing a free degree with $300,000 in the bank to a $300,000 degree with no money in the bank (or in some worse cases, debt), not degree versus no degree.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Rivet2000</b><br><br>I knew I should have labeled that humor<br><br>", "<b>Username: eyemgh</b><br><br>@Rivet2000, Oops. Sorry. <br>I have seen that exact same reply proffered with dead seriousness. :neutral:<br><br>", "<b>Username: roycroftmom</b><br><br>On campus recruiting is so much less important than it was even 3 years ago. With hundreds of companies, and pretty much all of Wall St, opting for the AI recruiting programs, it is no wonder that elite companies like JP Morgan have completely ceased all on campus recruiting. More will follow next year.  The world is indeed getting flat in many ways.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Ballerina016</b><br><br>And yet companies pay significant amounts to have access to elite schools resume databases.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Rivet2000</b><br><br>While less important, many of the larger employers still host on-campus events where students can take code tests and, if successful, have first round interviews all in the same day. Easier on the students and they employers alike. However, I agree that it\u2019s easier than ever to complete the process end-to-end online. That said, there are many other ways to get keyed into employers via lab connections, profs, and during poster sessions where employers (large and startup alike) as well as investment-types attend in surprising numbers.<br><br>", "<b>Username: eyemgh</b><br><br>@roycroftmom, while I agree that students can apply for and get jobs with companies that don\u2019t visit campus, there is some real value in seeing students and the students seeing said companies in person. My son had a tech interview wit Apple the same day that he met them at the career fair. He\u2019s also able to speak with people in person regarding not only which openings he\u2019d be best suited to from THEIR prospective, but to learn first hand what they like and don\u2019t like (if they are being honest) about where they work. Most recruiting tends to be regional even at the top schools, but my son was able to spend some real quality time with an engineer from Tait Towers. He\u2019s at a CA school and they\u2019re a smallish company (300 employees) from PA. They are world class at what they do though, as no one else really does what they do. Had he tried to vet them and their interest in him via a cold app, it would have been challenging. All that said, he\u2019s an engineer, and that might be different.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EganAg</b><br><br>@hello_you curious what your son\u2019s decision is. Mine chose the no scholarship option- Amherst over St Olaf, MAC over Conn/Earlham.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hello_you</b><br><br>All - OP here. The decision is\u2026 Wake Forest. He decided that Wake would give him similar opportunities and it\u2019d be a huge advantage to have a large portion of grad school paid for.<br>I\u2019d be lying if I say that I don\u2019t revisit the decision in my mind still, but he is at peace with it and that\u2019s all that matters.<br>Kudos to Wake for sincerely recruiting my son. The fact that Stanford has sent 0 emails and only one call (to ask - somewhat incredulously - why he hadn\u2019t signed up for the admit weekend) didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Meanwhile, Wake was sending emails highlighting what current scholarship students are researching and where they\u2019re traveling.<br>I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s over. Good luck to all that are still deciding. And a huge thanks those like @privatebanker and others that made well thought out arguments on both sides of this debate. We read them all and many gave us serious food for thought. We really appreciate it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CardinalBobcat</b><br><br>Thanks for the update, and all the best to your son for a great four years!<br><br>", "<b>Username: roycroftmom</b><br><br>congratulations and the very best wishes to your son.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EganAg</b><br><br>@hello_you congratulations!  In addition to being a great school, Wake is in Winston- Salem, a very nice southern city.<br>Thanks for the post as it helped us think through as we made our decisions as well.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Hoggirl</b><br><br>Congrats to your son, OP!

Win-Win really <br>Congrats to you both!<br><br>", "<b>Username: HoustonKen</b><br><br>@hello_you   Congrats on your decision.  We met another Stamps WFU Scholar at the Stanford reception in Houston.  They were from Shreveport, LA.   The dad texted me last week and said his son had picked WFU too.  Congrats !!!   @HogGirl  My daughter is in Palo Alto right now at the admitted students weekend.  I suspect we will decide Sunday or Monday \u2026 hopefully not at 11:59 pm.<br><br>", "<b>Username: HoustonKen</b><br><br>Quick update on our end. My daughter decided to go to Ole Miss and turn down Stanford.  Not gonna lie \u2026 i5 was wired watching her hit decline in the Stanford portal.  She is happy with her decision and excited for graduation and the next phase of her life<br><br>"]}
