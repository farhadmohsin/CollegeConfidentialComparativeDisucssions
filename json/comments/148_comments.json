If you need strangers on Internet to convince you in a few paragraphs to come to U of Chicago, I don\u2019t think UChicago is the right school for you. There are literally thousands of applicants who would like to take your spot because they love the school and understand why the school fits them better than any other schools.<br>That said, I second my fellow UChicago parents/alumni that you should visit all three schools and decide on which one fits you best.

All three will give you a great degree.  I think UChicago will do a better job of teaching you how to think.

I\u2019ll let the people who know more about UPenn and Brown speak about them, but as for Applied Math and Comp Sci - especially big data, UChicago is a good place to be right now.  The math department has been known for years as one of the top math departments in the US and several of my son\u2019s fellow math majors chose UChicago over MIT specifically for the math department.  And in case you hadn\u2019t heard, UChicago recently lured away the head of the UCal Berkeley comp sci department, built him a great new building and are ramping up the comp sci  - especially data analytics as we speak.  Oh, and Bill Gates is not only a trustee but sent his own son to UChicago.  It\u2019s a pretty exciting time to be a math/comp sci person at UChicago and the graduates of those programs are highly sought after.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Boothy2002</b><br><br>Nice options to consider.

Penn provides a lot of flexibility to do this.<br>The Penn alumni/student network is extensive and internship and job placement is excellent.<br><br>", "<b>Username: JHS</b><br><br><br> Sniggering about a student applying both to Brown and Chicago is wrongheaded and basically anti-intellectual.  It's easy for a student to like both enough to apply.  If students like the idea of the Core, they can fairly easily replicate it for themselves by judicious course selection at Brown, and many students do just that.  The only thing they can't replicate is sharing the common curriculum with everyone.  But even ardent Chicago fans have to admit there are plusses and minuses to that.  My daughter was a huge Core fan when she was applying, and she's a huge Core fan in retrospect.  But spring of her first year at Chicago, she was saying \"I wish I had given more thought to Brown.\"<br><br><br>I know several kids who applied to both Brown and Chicago.  None of them was unintelligent or unthoughtful.  Some chose one, some the other, some neither, and some had the choice made for them.<br><br> Among my kids' friends, the one who went to a brand-name consulting company whom I knew best was a kid who went to Brown and had a great experience there.  It was mostly centered on extracurriculars, though, not the classroom.  Class was just something he did to be able to keep working in his extracurricular and to qualify himself for what would come next (Bain, then Harvard Law School).  That attitude wouldn't work well at Chicago.  What people do in class is very important to them there, even the people who are really committed to other things as well.<br><br>One thing to look into \u2013 while in most of the world, Applied Math is very popular, and a mainstream thing to do, Chicago barely has an Applied Math program.  It just created that major a couple of years ago.  Of the three colleges, Chicago has by far the most pervasive math culture, and the highest percentage of people majoring in math, but hardly any of them do Applied Math.  And I think if you look at the Chicago Applied Math curriculum, it\u2019s barely distinguishable from its straight math curriculum.  At Chicago, people are really into mainstream theoretical math.  In addition to the formal Core, there\u2019s something of a math core as well.<br>(Also note:  If you are serious about a PhD in Economics, Chicago has a special variant of the straight Math major designed specifically for people who want to apply to Economics PhD programs.  It also has a great Statistics department as well.)<br>Another thing to look into \u2013 At Penn, the vast majority of people who want the kind of career path you are talking about (not the one involving a PhD in Economics) will be in Wharton, not CAS.  And there will be a lot of them.  People make way too much of a big deal about the difference between Wharton and CAS, but there\u2019s no question that the Wharton students find it in their interest to cultivate the myth that CAS students are second-rate.<br><br>", "<b>Username: slashermaster1920</b><br><br>@Much2learn<br>Sure, I might technically be able to apply. But would I be given as much of a chance as Wharton students all else equal?<br><br>", "<b>Username: milee30</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>Sniggering about a student applying both to Brown and Chicago is wrongheaded and basically anti-intellectual.<br>\"\"<br><br>@Publisher  - maybe you can clarify, but I didn\u2019t interpret your post as sniggering, but instead just pointing out how interesting it is to have open minded people who recognized the merits of two very different yet awesome unis.  Were you sniggering?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Much2learn</b><br><br>@slashermaster1920<br>Penn engineering students have a lot of options and many accept investment or consulting jobs. Many of those positions have seen increasing value in hiring students with computer science, math and statistics skills, which combined are basically the aspects of data science.<br>Recently, an increasing number of Penn engineers are turning down finance opportunities to work in tech and they are getting those jobs too. The program is rigorous but grads have a lot of options. The average grad has over two job offers the last time I saw data. That is almost unheard of.

Penn CAS kids place very well into consulting and finance jobs and do get a lot of attention from recruiters. Obviously not as many CAS kids are interested in these jobs as wharton kids so not as many go into I, but this also means there is less competition. Just look at the stats on the Penn career services website.<br>Also as Penn CAS students you can take as many Wharton classes as you want and have access to all the various undergraduate business clubs and research going on at Wharton.

The \u201ceveryone\u201d at UChicago includes not only undergraduates but also many faculty members (who, if they teach undergrads at all, are appointed to \u201cThe College\u201d). So the whole community of The College shares in the Core.<br>As I remember things there (dunno how much it may have changed) many Core courses were team taught (or team designed). Many of the teaching materials were prepared by faculty teams and compiled by the university press. There was a relatively high degree of integration among courses and disciplines. Even the furniture came into play:  typically, students and the instructor all sat around a big table (as opposed to students in rank-and-file order facing the teacher at a lectern).<br>So \u2026  since a couple posters above invoked Steve Jobs and Bill Gates \u2026 the difference between the UChicago Core and other undergraduate programs is a bit like the difference between the Apple \u201cecosystem\u201d and the relative patchwork you get with other computing platforms.

If you want to do consulting at a place like McKinsey out of school are probably best at Penn, then a tie between Brown and Chicago. You can check the numbers on LinkedIn - Penn sends kids to top consulting firms in droves. For STEM, you probably have a wash between all three with the edge going to Penn and Brown for computer science/engineering/data science and the edge going to Chicago for math/statistics. In terms of alumni network, however, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s close. Penn has an amazing network that crawls every corner of business and tech, similar to schools like Columbia, Dartmouth and Duke. But in terms of quality of life, your best bet is probably Brown, then Penn, and lastly UChicago, if that is something you are considering. Your ability to get into top PhDs from any of these schools will be about the same - while they are not as fine-tuned as schools like MIT and Harvard, they can all get you the right opportunities. Also, please don\u2019t look at things like rankings to decide - most rankings actually have Penn and Brown ahead of UChicago except for US News, so it would be an invalid argument to say any of them are \u201cmore prestigious\u201d or \u201chigher ranked.\u201d<br><br>"]}
