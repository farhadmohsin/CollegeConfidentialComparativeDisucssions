{"title": "nyu vs harvard", "comments": ["<b>Username: pleaseplease</b><br><br>I'm trying to choose between the two. Up until a few days ago I was planning on going to NYU because I never expected to get into Harvard. I was really excited when I found out, but now I don't know what to do. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Listenkid</b><br><br>Imma tell you what I Told my best friend when his girlfriend dumped him. If you can't appreciate how amazing a harvard education is, you dont deserve it,.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stephennn</b><br><br>you're nuts.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gloriapb</b><br><br>Harvard!hell yeah!<br><br>", "<b>Username: NyJeo</b><br><br>um..Harvard<br><br>", "<b>Username: pleaseplease</b><br><br>I've lived in Boston my whole life though, and I kind of just want to get out.<br>But I'm afraid I'm drawn to Harvard because of the name. I know the education I get from an honors program at NYU won't be as good as one from Harvard, but I want to do more than just study for the next four years. I also wanted to double major, which will probably be easier to do at NYU.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gloriapb</b><br><br>Is your choice but..seriously?no to Harvard?go visit the campus and figure it out..AND Harvard has much more school spirit than NYU.SERIOUSLY, harvard.Check websites like princeton review and get some info of student life..i dont think u will only study in harvard tho.AMAZING TEACHERS.and the name...<br><br>", "<b>Username: pleaseplease</b><br><br>I know. I feel like I obviously should go to Harvard. But NYU seems like it would be so much fun. I visited last weekend and loved it.<br><br>", "<b>Username: missamericanpie</b><br><br>@please<br><br>you could come to NYU for a summer and take some classes. sometimes you can get those classes to count towards your major at Harvard. and NYC is AMAZING in the summer!<br><br>", "<b>Username: NiraliMag</b><br><br>Go to Harvard, people kill for brand names. I am trying to transfer from NYU to Brown, so as you can see, everyone wants prestige.<br><br>", "<b>Username: brightside09</b><br><br>Go where you'll be happy. Harvard is better for graduate school than undergrad, and it seems like you might be into that possibility. If you don't want to go to Harvard, don't. Don't let a reputation be the deciding factor. It's not like people think NYU is a trash education, it's still amazing. Having NYU on your resume will open doors too.<br><br>", "<b>Username: radio rabbit</b><br><br>Nirali, didn't you get into Stern ED for next year?<br><br>And to the OP, I mean, this is Harvard were talking about. Harvard. If you KNOW you're going to be miserable though, then maybe you say no. But if you think you could be happy, I would take it in a heartbeat.<br><br>", "<b>Username: pleaseplease</b><br><br>Do you think it would be much harder to get into Harvard grad school coming from NYU than Harvard undergrad? Of course going to Harvard first will make it easier, but is it a big enough difference to be a deciding factor here?<br><br>", "<b>Username: NiraliMag</b><br><br>Yeah, but I can still transfer to Brown after my first year there if I don't get killed by the Stern curve.<br><br>", "<b>Username: gloriapb</b><br><br>And if u go to harvard and want to transfer, probably NYU would take u again..u can do that in a year.<br><br>", "<b>Username: compaq10</b><br><br>Go to NYU. Enjoy 4 years in NY. You will love it! Study hard too. So you can go back to Boston for graduate school :)<br><br>", "<b>Username: radio rabbit</b><br><br>Nirali (again): But you haven't even been to Stern yet! You haven't even had one week at NYU!<br><br>OP: If you reject Harvard for undergrad, you are less likely to get in grad school at Harvard. It's like if your older sibling rejects a school, you're more likely to get rejected. (I'm not sure why it works like that, but that's seriously the trend)<br><br>", "<b>Username: missamericanpie</b><br><br>@radio<br><br>that's the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard. grad admissions are completely different than undergrad admissions. there are so many more factors at play for grad admissions. and that is definitely not one of them.<br><br>", "<b>Username: radio rabbit</b><br><br>But I think it might be a \"well, you rejected us once, you're likely to reject us twice\" sort of deal. It might not be statistically true, but I'm sure there are admissions officers that have that mindset. That sort of thing CERTAINLY happens with older/younger siblings.<br><br>I say that because my younger brother had a friend who applied to a competitive private middle school, and rejected it, and later applied to that same school's high school, and got rejected, even though his stats were good for that school. It's not quite the same thing, but the logic of it is pretty comparable.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lockn</b><br><br>It is easy to transfer into NYU. Harvard does not accept any transfers. You have an amazing opportunity and you might as well try it out.<br>\"\"But I think it might be a \"well, you rejected us once, you're likely to reject us twice\" sort of deal. It might not be statistically true, but I'm sure there are admissions officers that have that mindset.\"\"<br>I doubt the grad school will even be aware that you were admitted undergrad.<br><br>", "<b>Username: missamericanpie</b><br><br>@radio<br><br>i just wanted to debunk the grad school thing. i don't have siblings so i don't know about the validity of that statement.<br><br>grad school is all about how you fit with that department. grad prestige and undergrad prestige might as well be bananas and kiwis. the process is completely different. it has to do with research, faculty fit, interview, GREs. it's the department that is primarily looking at your application- graduate school admissions committees are only looking to see if you meet minimum requirements. it's the department's decision whether to take you or not.<br><br>grad committees and undergrad committees have completely different officers. often, the grad school and the undergrad school have slightly different names and completely different offices. take NYU: college of arts and sciences vs. graduate school of arts and sciences. steinhardt's media, culture and communications vs. steinhardt visual culture MA, etc.<br><br>i'm a junior and looking to go to grad school for new media, so i've been looking into this. i've also shadowed friends who went through the process for their phd.<br><br>", "<b>Username: pleaseplease</b><br><br>I wouldn't want to transfer because I wouldn't get the same scholarship I have now. They said it was only offered to 70 incoming freshman, the DEAN scholarship program. It is basically the reason why I can consider NYU as an option. It gives me $25,000 a year, its an honors program, and has a few other extra benefits I wouldn't have as a regular student.<br><br>Thanks for all the info about grad programs btw. I'm pretty clueless about that.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sharifpasha</b><br><br>Harvard. In a heartbeat. Come on, this ones easy :)<br><br>", "<b>Username: jh2633</b><br><br>I fail to see how you failed to see that you would get into Harvard... considering that you are accepted to NYU's dean program. Most of NYU's \"fun factor\" is just a facade(unless you enjoy hipsters, dorm parties, lack of community etc etc). Go with Harvard, it'll do you some good.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jh2633</b><br><br>oh, and as another note, last year TIME had an article regarding students who rejected Ivy Leagues in pursue of small liberal arts colleges<br><br>", "<b>Username: octobersky28</b><br><br>I'd say go to Harvard. You have all the time in the world to live in NY and have fun if you really want to. Not many people say they went to Harvard, I suppose. And then when you have that under your belt, you can enjoy NY so much more.<br>Good luck.<br><br>", "<b>Username: RedOktober</b><br><br>One day, in the middle of a class at NYU, your stomach is going to start churning and you'll get a huge headache as you realize: \"Wow, I had the chance to go to Harvard. What am I doing here...I blew it.\"<br><br>", "<b>Username: NiraliMag</b><br><br>@ Radio: Okay stop **** you bitc h, I always wanted to go to Brown, and i don't need some ass h ol e on CC telling me what to do. I am just using Stern as a stepping stone. If the curve does not kill me and I have a high GPA, I am going to try every semester as hard as I can to transfer into Brown. A lot of kids just quit trying to better themselves after their Senior year of college admissions, for me, getting into Stern is the start of college admissions. I stayed at summer @ Brown for three weeks, and I thought it was a very good fit. All of these losers on CC think they are so smart and have the world made. They think the world is their oyster.<br><br>", "<b>Username: NotMamaRose</b><br><br>I think the OP should just go where his/her gut is telling him/her to go. In the long run, the only thing that matters is that you learn a lot and have a good experience. You can get that at any number of colleges/universities in the country. Go where you want to go and no need to justify it to anyone else! Your parents can brag you got into Harvard even if you decide not to go. It's not about them. It's about YOU.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stephennn</b><br><br>isn't nyu stern better than brown's business program? (does brown even have business?)<br><br>chill brah.<br><br>", "<b>Username: NiraliMag</b><br><br>Yeah, it doesn't matter if it is, Brown sends a ridiculous amount of students into top Ivy Graduate schools, that is what I am after, since most people believe grad school is all that counts.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Franciscog24</b><br><br>Seriously, I'm not trying to sound blunt but.....where's the comparison? HARVARD, HARVARD, HARVARD. If you're going to get a graduate degree like law or medicine that's a different story, ex. I didn't apply to HYPS since I'm saving my chances. But if undergrad is your focus then....HARVARD, HARVARD, HARVARD!!!! You'll make connections that anyone would kill for. I'm not saying that going to Harvard would give you instant success, but you're more than likely to get a great job from the get-go. And plus like someone else said, you may be sitting in a class at nyu and you think \"what could've happened if I went to Harvard\". Not many ppl. can have bragging rights like this (not that I'm endorsing bragging by any means).<br><br>", "<b>Username: Ohboi</b><br><br>i don't think brown has a business program.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Ohboi</b><br><br>does harvard even have business for undergrad?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Vonegutted</b><br><br>Go to Harvard! If all else fails, I'm sure it'd be much easier to transfer into NYU than vice versa.<br><br>", "<b>Username: molly4190</b><br><br>I don't think Harvard has an Undergrad Business, a lot of top schools don't since they prefer liberal arts majors (humanities, social sci, sci) to pre-professional ones, which i think is a better idea.<br><br>Honestly, I go to NYU and a lot of people here would kill to go to Harvard. And if you go to Harvard and hate it, it's relatively easy to transfer to NYU after a year. But Harvard doesn't take transfers.<br><br>Harvard also has a more \"traditional\" undergrad experience, beautiful campus, is outside a large city but still has a strong campus community, some people prefer that. NYU is very unique, we have no campus, not much community feel, it feels like you're in Grad school sometimes and after frosh year the dorms get really far away from campus.<br><br>I can understand someone picking NYU over Harvard for Film, Theatre, Dance, any artsy-majors, or maybe even Business, or maybe Philosophy. We also have strong programs in IR, Econ, and Math, although i'm guessing Harvard is really strong in those too. But for most majors I'd pick Harvard.<br><br>You'll have the rest of your life to live in NYC, but probably only 1 chance to go to Harvard. And btw, studies have shown Harvard UnderGrads have an EASIER time getting into Harvard Grad. I hear the hardest part is getting in, they have grade inflation there. Plus the student body is on <i>average</i> smarter and more diverse than NYU so that's a bonus.<br><br>", "<b>Username: pleaseplease</b><br><br>I am 100% planning on grad school, if that makes a difference.<br>I'm worried if I go to Harvard I'm going to spend the whole time in my dorm room studying and not have a fun/exciting college experience. I was also thinking of doing a double major, which might be waaay to hard to do at Harvard.<br><br>Does anyone who goes to NYU know anything about the DEAN scholars program? I had never heard about it until I got in so all of my information is coming from what the school told me.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Endicott</b><br><br>Harvard! NYU is mediocre and has no spirit of community. NYC is way too distracting.<br><br>", "<b>Username: molly4190</b><br><br>pleaseplease - if you're doing Grad, I'd suggest you pick the college you like more, as the prestige of Grad matters a lot more than UG. There are students at both NYU and Harvard who sit in their dorms and study all day, there are fun things to do at both as well...from what I hear, Harvard is not too hard to do well in if you're smart enough to get in. People say \"getting in was the hardest part\".<br><br>Endicott - wow you sound like a tool. no need to insult other people's colleges and call them mediocre, and if you haven't been there, how do you know there is no community? unless you're a student... As for being distracting, Boston/Cambridge ain't exactly the boondocks either. A smart person like the OP would probably do well at both schools, esp NYU since it's less competitive.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lockn</b><br><br>Will you go to the pre-frosh weekend at Harvard? I get the impression that since admissions is so random, it's not like you're surrounded by only major overachievers. Half of the people there are shocked they got in, and were just smart people who had good grades (many of whom do not study all day).<br><br>", "<b>Username: stephennn</b><br><br>a top 50 university is hardly mediocre.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Vonegutted</b><br><br>Haha, how is NYU mediocore!? All tier 1 schools are in the top 1% of universities in the country...<br><br>", "<b>Username: jh2633</b><br><br>MIT does throw pretty damn good frat parties, I don't think you'll be disappointed .<br><br>", "<b>Username: pleaseplease</b><br><br>Thanks to everyone who helped!<br><br>I think I'll probably be going to Harvard next year. As much as I would love to live in New York and go to NYU, almost everyone I've talked to has said Harvard. I think it might have been my senioritis mentality telling me to go to nyc and party, rather than staying in Boston and going to Harvard.<br><br>", "<b>Username: minichiellom</b><br><br>It sounds shallow and cliche - but honestly, you'll get so many more opportunities out of going to Harvard. In terms of price, it also means you're far more likely to make back the cost of college in careers later.<br>Congratulations!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Jakeesha</b><br><br>ok this is simple.....go to harvard!!! You got in because they want you there and think that you will be able to handle it. If you get into harvard, you go to harvard.<br><br>", "<b>Username: milkandsugar</b><br><br>I say, go where your gut tells you, not what anyone else says. Its 4 years of your life and it should be spent where you think you will get the most. Harvard isn't for everyone and it is quite different than NYU, but you will get a good education at both and meet amazing people and professors at both. Good luck.<br><br>", "<b>Username: windylane</b><br><br>Harvard! You have all the time in the world for NYC, and while it probably sounds insanely appealing to get away from the hometown, Harvard is an incredible opportunity. My best friend goes goes there, and I can safely assure you that based off of what I've seen when I've stayed in her dorm and from what she's told me, it's not all about studying. There is so much to do in Cambridge and Boston (as you probably know), but the campus life itself for freshmen seemed really vibrant. There were lots of activities, clubs, and other events on campus the weekend I was there. And if you're worried about getting stuck with non-stop studiers, don't be... it ranges. Some of her friends were workaholics, but she actually got assigned to live with a couple of hardcore partiers. The first night I was there I slept on the couch, but was woken up at 4 AM when one of the roomies stumbled in wasted and tried to sit on me. Not that I'm encouraging you to drink your way through college, but don't be worried about having a lackluster social life at Harvard. There's lots of different people there, from the crazy studiers to the insane partiers.<br>Also, I know it's more minimal to consider, but the dorms are beautiful! Her freshmen dorm was lovely, and this year lucked out as well too. Supposedly there's a lot of \"house\" spirit after your freshmen year, unlike NYU where everyone is spread out and doing their own thing.<br><br>", "<b>Username: apatel_55</b><br><br>pleaseplease... HAHA I was kind of in the same boat with ivies vs. nyu. I must have met you! I was at the Scholars Weekend at NYU. I was chosen for MLK, but theyre like the same and we were all together. but i think im going to Penn :) so excited. although nyu mlk/dean was a strong runner up... This is just to tell you.. I know where youre coming from bc this program really was amazing to your defense. oh and Seamus (another scholar who was with us) is trying to decide between Brown and the MLK NYU program! so youre not the only one! haha<br><br>", "<b>Username: Guazn</b><br><br>are you stupid? Harvard...hands down<br><br>", "<b>Username: bv123</b><br><br>Are you crazy...HARVARD!<br><br>", "<b>Username: catherine</b><br><br>Harvard!!!! If you don't like it you can transfer anywhere! My dad went to Yale and he says even though he's 50, it STILL helps him to have goe to Yale. Crazy. NYU is a great school, but go to Harvard!<br><br>If you love NY so much you may end up living there...and then you will wish you had gone to school somewhere else.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Listenkid</b><br><br>The ONLY reason I have to tell you NYU is because if you are dumb enough to ask this question, quite frankly you might not be smart enough to go to Harvard.<br><br><br><br>JK that was a joke go to harvard.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Mathy</b><br><br>Harvard but note they have a curve where only 15% of students a class get As. Do research. Thats what i heard. That is worse than Stern's 35%.<br><br>", "<b>Username: stephennn</b><br><br>... i was always under the impression that harvard had serious grade inflation.<br><br>princeton is the ivy with grade deflation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: nicky91</b><br><br>Everyone needs to call down.<br>This is a legit question-<br>NYU vs Harvard. He is not being ridiculous- they are both top schools in the country and while Harvard might have more prestige, it's just a name. The thing is you will get internships and jobs from both schools, no question about it.<br>If you ask yourself this question it is because you love NYU but feel like you can't say no to Harvard, but you can. Its YOU who is going to be competing in Harvard next year-- when you go visit schools, you just KNOW if it's right for you.<br><br>Dude, I think you've already made your decision.<br><br>", "<b>Username: worth2try</b><br><br>I find that the people who really like NYU are the ones who know EXACTLY why they like NYC and how they're going to take advantage of it. Do you?<br>The major complaints are that NYC is expensive and can feel lonely. I am in CAS and am very satisfied with the quality of education. Not sure what field of study you're considering.<br><br>I am an NYU student, so feel free to ask me any more Q's. However, if I were you, I would go to Harvard.<br><br>"]}
