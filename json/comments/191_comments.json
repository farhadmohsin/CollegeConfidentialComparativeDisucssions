{"title": "stanford vs princeton accepted", "comments": ["<b>Username: cllgerower1999</b><br><br>hi there college confidential community!<br>I am a male rower who has been recruited to Stanford, Princeton, and Tulsa, and have been accepted to all 3 schools (in their own ways, hard to explain) for the class of 2022.Currently I am struggling to decide between Stanford and Princeton and would appreciate any insight on offer. I know that ultimately they are both amazing schools and cannot go wrong.<br>I have visited all 3 schools, but between S and P they are both very different in terms of vibe and student body- the \u2018laidback\u2019 atmosphere is more prominent at Stanford. I cannot say whether I prefer that more or less, so not much of a deciding factor however I do appreciate the sort of \u2018preppy\u2019 aura at Princeton. Architecture isn\u2019t a huge deal for me either.<br>Weather would typically not be a factor for me at all, except for the fact I am a recruited athlete and would have to train year round. Rowing, in winter, is not particularly pleasant as it\u2019s long months of indoor training which I would find at Princeton. At Stanford, we can be on the water all year round (sun!). That being said I grew up on the West Coast and wouldn\u2019t mind a change of scenery.<br>In terms of academics I am undecided about my major at this point so am reluctant to choose a school based on the \u2018rankings\u2019 of a certain pathway, but I am leaning towards the STEM route, specifically health studies and not CS. From my understanding, both schools are great for that anyway.<br>One thing that is attractive is Princeton\u2019s perceived focus on undergrads and professor: student ratio, but on the other hand, Stanford\u2019s access to grad school resources and research opportunities can\u2019t be ignored- particularly in terms of the Co-Term program.<br>As an athlete Stanford\u2019s athletic program is of the best in the country, versus Princeton\u2019s \u2018Ivy Leauge\u2019 athletics. In terms of my sport of rowing, Stanford ranks supreme in this area. Stanford\u2019s support for athletes in terms of resources, facilities, and academic support is hard to come by.<br>I also see Stanford as a university that will gain more prestige in the coming years due to it\u2019s prominence for technology, silicon valley, etc. That\u2019s not to say Princeton prestige is to be ignored, still one of the best in th country.<br>Despite all the positives about Stanford there is something about Princeton\u2019s unforgettable feelings on campus that I can\u2019t ignore. Maybe a gut feeling or may just be me being an indecisive teenage boy\u2026<br>Thanks for any feedback!<br><br>", "<b>Username: prodesse</b><br><br>You have great choices. Is the bottom-line price tag (including travel) an issue?<br>In this case you might want to give the highest weight to the rowing particulars. Which coach did you like better? Would you be a star at one school and average at the other? What kind of academic support do they give their athletes? Were the team members full-of-themselves or welcoming? See if you can talk to some of them about positives and negatives.<br>Let us know what you decide!<br><br>", "<b>Username: TiggerDad</b><br><br>As you stated, you can\u2019t go wrong with either P or S. Ultimately, my best advise is to go with your own \u201cgut\u201d feelings.<br>When my son was making his list of schools to apply to, we had a specific strategy with which then we prioritized based on my son\u2019s desired factors. The first and foremost was the institution\u2019s overall undergraduate quality and experience. While we don\u2019t take any college rankings seriously, it\u2019s really no surprise that Princeton comes in as a perennial #1 at each new publication of the USNWR. Princeton\u2019s students-to-teacher ratio of 5:1 is the best there is. Coupled that with their Preceptorial Method, which is a modified version of the Oxford tutorial, what you have is an outstanding undergraduate learning experience.<br>By intention, Princeton has set their institutional focus on undergraduate more than graduate students. Their undergraduate population is only 5,232 while the graduate population is 2,747. Stanford, on the other hand, has about 2,000 more undergraduate population than Princeton and about 11,000 graduate population. Again, by institutional design, Princeton doesn\u2019t have Law, Medical and Business schools. Princeton\u2019s endowment per student is also perennially ranked #1 with $2.7M endowment per student, while Stanford is ranked #5 with $1.5M. And Princeton\u2019s alumni giving, an important signifier of undergrad student satisfaction, is also perennially at #1.<br>Since you mentioned it, HYP has that elite \u201cIvy League\u201d prestige while Stanford has its own \u201cStanford prestige.\u201d While Stanford prestige might still grow and no matter how much it could possibly gain with time, it still isn\u2019t the same as the HYP\u2019s Ivy League mystique. And it\u2019s not like HYP and other Ivy League are at stand still while Stanford forges ahead leaps and bounds with prestige-building. It\u2019s not that my son and I don\u2019t like Stanford. When we made a priority list of colleges to apply to, Stanford was 4th on our list after HYP, and that was strictly based on our assessment of undergrad qualities and experiences. My son loves Princeton as the right place to get his undergrad degree while he\u2019s aiming at Stanford as one of top few grad schools to apply to. As an undergraduate-focused institution, my son would rather bet on the institution with 2,000 less undergrad students. Less chance to get lost in the shuffle.<br>But these remarks are my and my son\u2019s take. Everyone\u2019s needs are different. Ultimately, as I stated at the very beginning, go with your own gut feelings after exhaustively investigating on undergrad quality comparisons. Good luck with your decision making. Either way, you\u2019ll be in a great place.<br><br>", "<b>Username: DeepBlue86</b><br><br>^^^This.

The Stanford men\u2019s soccer team is the 2-tIme defending national champion. The Stanford women\u2019s soccer team is currently #1 in the country and a perennial College Cup (Final 4) participant. The women\u2019s volleyball team won the championship last year. Swimming, tennis, blah, blah, blah, you get the point. About 15-20% of the campus are recruited athletes at Stanford.<br>I do want to say that there are more than few cold (32 degrees ish) mornings here in the winter, so hopefully, Stanford will let you use the indoor ERG\u2019s instead of hitting the Bay.  :))<br><br>", "<b>Username: AboutTheSame</b><br><br>I have no knowledge of Princeton crew but I only see one Stanford team (women 2014) on the list of Pac12 men\u2019s and women\u2019s champions in the last 30 years.  I will admit my bias as a Cal alum (too many crew titles to count), but I would strongly recommend Princeton unless you think you want to be a West Coast person after graduating.  Stanford has a definite focus on graduate students versus undergraduates; Princeton does not.  As the father of a Dartmouth grad from California, I\u2019d recommend a change of scenery for your college years.  There\u2019s a lot to learn outside of class.<br><br>", "<b>Username: happy1</b><br><br>You have put yourself in the enviable position of having two absolutely amazing choices.

My first job out of grad school took me to New England, however. Now, I only like to visit CA to see my family members once in a while but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m moving back there even for my retirement. Moving to New England was one of the best things that had happened in my life.<br><br>", "<b>Username: LoveTheBard</b><br><br>I can\u2019t comment on crew at either school, but how you feel about each of the school\u2019s coaches and team dynamic the  should get very strong consideration.<br>What I can say is that the undergraduate experience at Stanford has been absolutely amazing for my D and she is 100% certain that she made the right choice in selecting S over H, Y, and P.<br>My D., a humanities kid through and through, is in SLE \u2013 a living/learning program similar to Y\u2019s Directed Studies and P\u2019s HUM Sequence, but better in that it includes a very vibrant residential component: all of her SLE classes take place in the late afternoon at the dorm and discussions continue well into the night. There is resident faculty that lives on site that regularly opens his home to students and puts together events, BBQs, and field trips on what seems to be practically a daily basis. D.'s other classes are outstanding and her profs are exceedingly accessible \u2013 not to mention utterly brilliant and tops in their respective fields.<br>Forget prestige \u2013 both schools are prestigious. The bottom line is it comes down to fit: Stanford has a very west coast feel \u2013 its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have \u201c[appreciated] the \u2026 \u2018preppy\u2019 vibe.\u201d<br>I would have no concerns about Stanford\u2019s undergraduate focus \u2013 from what I\u2019ve seen, the school is very invested in creating the best undergraduate experience imaginable for its students.<br>D\u2019s approach is the opposite of that of @TiggerDad\u2019s son: H, Y, and P will be there for grad school; she sought to select the best possible undergraduate experience in the best possible environment.

Which school has greater strength in your area of academic interest? What resources does each school have for assisting you towards your career path given your major?<br>What pedagogical style do you prefer? Princeton has the Preceptorial Method which is a modified Oxford tutorial learning environment with 5:1 student-teacher ratio. I\u2019m not as familiar with Stanford\u2019s pedagogical methods, so I\u2019ll leave that for other knowledgeable folks to contribute here.<br>Princeton has residential college (6) system, and each college where you\u2019d be housed is staffed by 1) the college dean, 2) director of studies, 3) faculty advisers, 4) peer academic advisers and 5) director of student life, a staff member dedicated to support your health and well being.

However, they\u2019re very different in culture and experience, so do make a wise decision based on YOUR personality and needs. One big mistake I\u2019ve seen so many young students make is going with what their peers think are a greater choice when instead they need to really dig into their self-knowledge of who they\u2019re and what they want to accomplish in life.

I believe P still does this.<br>Another possible upside to P is being in the Ivy League and a more compact region, travel won\u2019t be as much of a grueling schedule compared to the spread out Pac-12.<br>S&P are the best of the best and pretty much a tie for academics and prestige/reputation.  But I still say bottom line, the OP has to determine which athletic program/coaching/teammates/facilities he likes better as this will consume  most of his time.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Data10</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>The point of my Math example is that a quarter system class is not a semester amount of material packed into a quarter.<br>\"\"<br><br>As mentioned in my earlier post, you can either take single variable calculus  in 2 quarters or 3 quarters, depending on which math sequence you choose.  It only shows that you have a choice of whether to pack what some other colleges do in a semester or not.   The 3 course sequence you mentioned includes 3-unit courses, so they are expected to cover less material than typical Stanford/Princeton math classes and contribute less than typical Stanford/Princeton classes towards graduation requirements.  Of course most Stanford students already took single variable calculus in HS.   The more typical higher level math sequences also seem to list more material in  their description for Stanford\u2019s 3 quarters than Princeton\u2019s 2 semesters.  For example Stanford\u2019s quarter length math 51-53 covers multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations.  Princeton\u2019s math 201-202 covers multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but not explicitly differential equations.  However, they also may have the equivalent of more units to reflect the increased material.   It\u2019s not as simple as either 3 quarters of material at Stanford = 2 semesters of material elsewhere  or quarter != semester.  It depends on the class, number of units, and often falls somewhere in between those two extremes\u2026<br>If you want to have a general rule,  it\u2019s been my experience that 3 quarters at Stanford generally covers more material than 2 semesters elsewhere.  Quarter length classes did appear to be equivalent to semester length in some cases, but not all.    However, I haven\u2019t taken classes at Princeton or colleges at that academic level, besides Stanford\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: prezbucky</b><br><br>Princeton is more undergrad-focused, which you mentioned. That is directly or indirectly (or both\u2026) responsible for them being ranked #1 for undergrad by USNews. Grads show the love by donating.<br>Stanford is better known (and ranked) internationally due to its grad/PhD-level greatness, but you aren\u2019t getting your MBA (P\u2019ton doesn\u2019t have a B school\u2026), JD or PhD \u2013 you\u2019re getting your BA or BS. For that, no university is better than Princeton.<br>If you were interested in Engineering or CS, Stanford has the edge. But Princeton is solid in those things and great at about everything else, and where curriculum is even, Princeton has the edge given the close interaction with your profs. Princeton\u2019s reputational bread is buttered by its undergrads and undergraduate emphasis, and that drives the budgeting and decision-making of the school. The undergrads are #1 there \u2013 they have to be, since they comprise nearly 70% of the total student population. Motivation and capacity (largest per-student endowment) equal performance.<br>Regardless of your choice, you\u2019ll be at a great school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Data10</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>I am leaning towards the STEM route, specifically health studies<br>\"\"<br><br>Health studies may be a significant difference between S and P.     I believe the closest field at Stanford is Human Biology, which was Stanford\u2019s most popular major until the recent CS boom.   It\u2019s an  interdisciplinary field that lets you design a customized program based on your interests and goals, choosing courses from a good variety of other fields, outside of human biology classes.  Stanford is big on such  interdisciplinary programs like this, coterm degrees that combine BS+MS, etc.  I\u2019m not as familiar with the options at Princeton, but I do see that they offer the option to supplement major with Global Health and Health Policy and obtain a related certification, which Stanford does not have an equivalent\u2026<br><br>\"\"<br>Weather would typically not be a factor for me at all, except for the fact I am a recruited athlete and would have to train year round. Rowing, in winter, is not particularly pleasant as it\u2019s long months of indoor training which I would find at Princeton. At Stanford, we can be on the water all year round (sun!). That being said I grew up on the West Coast and wouldn\u2019t mind a change of scenery.<br>\"\"<br><br>I\u2019ve lived on both the east and west coast, and have rowed at Stanford.  I found the rowing at Stanford to be rough on mornings when it was cold and/or raining.   I imagine this would be quite a bit worse at Princeton with more extreme temps and triple the rain, but that may be just me.   I think I am more sensitive to weather than most, or maybe I\u2019ve become spoiled by living in CA for so long.<br>This brings up another relevant point.    I grew up in upstate NY. I currently live in CA, largely because of the large CA presence at Stanford job fairs, and because I enjoyed the CA area while at Stanford. If you want to live/work/internship in the SV or CA area, Stanford has a strong edge. Similarly, I\u2019m sure the Princeton area has a strong college presence and a large number of area companies with special network/internship areas.  If you\u2019d like to live/work/internship in the Princeton area or are interested in IB/wall street, Princeton would have a big edge.<br><br>", "<b>Username: kalons</b><br><br>before I read the responses to this post, I knew most of them would be telling you to choose stanford, and I tend to agree. stanford\u2019s athletics are some of the best (arguably, THE best, in my opinion) in the country, and there\u2019s an underlying emphasis (though a little subtle) to pursue a major in the STEM field since its close proximity to silicon valley. like others have said, princeton is more undergraduate focused whereas stanford is more graduate focused. princeton also holds the \u201civy prestige\u201d vs stanford who is in a league of its own. all of that being said, I, personally, think stanford is the clear choice for you. (though, I understand the want for a change in environment! that\u2019s why I\u2019m wanting to leave the south and go somewhere in the northeast or west, haha.) you, truly, can\u2019t go wrong with either choice. congratulations, and good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: twinsmama</b><br><br>There is a definite cultural difference between east and west coasts.
