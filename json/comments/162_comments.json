{"title": "wharton vs stern", "comments": ["<b>Username: dannydalt64</b><br><br>Hi all! I\u2019m in a bit of a dilemma\u2026<br>Just about a few weeks ago, I had finished hearing from all of my schools and I was delighted to find out that I had been accepted to both Penn(Wharton) and NYU(Stern). As excited and grateful I am for the opportunity, now comes the most important part, the decision-making process which has been quite difficult for me and my family.<br>NYU had told me that they\u2019d be able to cover 90% of my tuition (about 45K annually) if I were to attend Stern. As for Penn, I have not received any financial aid, and though I will be visiting the school soon and meeting with a FA representative I do not expect to get much. Penn has been my top choice for a while, but the money provided by NYU would also be a big plus too. Given the scenario, it\u2019d great if anyone could give me their input on the situation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: garymui</b><br><br>Are you talking about undergrad or grad school?  I did Wharton undergrad (M&T) and then got my MBA at NYU (part-time while employeed).  For what it\u2019s worth, I definitely felt that the Wharton undergrad classes were more advanced (and harder) than the Stern classes.  This could be an undergrad / grad difference, but the caliber of students at Wharton was higher than at Stern.<br><br>", "<b>Username: dannydalt64</b><br><br>@garymui At the undergraduate level.

Also, what are your career goals?<br><br>", "<b>Username: garymui</b><br><br>As IBXavier2017 suggested, I\u2019d wait for the Penn offer before deciding anything. Penn is need based so if NYU\u2019s offer was based on need, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Penn\u2019s offer was similar in terms of family contribution. If you are keen on pursuing business, I would recommend Wharton.  It is what you do with it but I know I got job interviews based on the Wharton degree. For me there are other factors that would lead me to Penn like coordinated dual degree programs you can do with Wharton undergrad (I was accepted into Wharton and then transferred into M&T) and even though it is an in urban setting, it still have a very campus feel to it.  NYU will pretty much be an all urban setting.<br><br>", "<b>Username: dannydalt64</b><br><br>@aoeuidhtns I\u2019m not 100% but I\u2019m considering concentrations of Finance, Operations/Info Systems, Social impact and/or a math minor.

For me, however, I would prefer Wharton as not only is it oftened regarded at a #1 business school burn I feel that I would be a much better fit at the school socially and campus. But then again idk if the money is fully worth that experience. The money I received from NYU is tuition remession based (not need) so I\u2019m unsure of how Penn will respond to that.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Publisher</b><br><br>NYU Stern is the clear choice if the cost difference is $23,000 per year for NYU Stern versus about $69,000 per year for Penn Wharton. The cost difference over 4 years is about $184,000 ($46,000 X 4) plus interest. NYU Stern finance is one of the best undergraduate programs in the world. Lots of internship opportunities.<br>Earn a NYU Stern degree, work for two to three years, then get an MBA from Wharton, Columbia, Northwestern, Chicago, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Dartmouth, UCal-Bezerkley or even from Duke, Virginia, Michigan and you will be much better off than just having an undergraduate degree from Wharton. Or get a one year specialty masters degree in finance, data science, etc. if that is your career goal.<br>Do NOT pay sticker price for Wharton when you have a very substantial discount from NYU Stern.

With the undergrad degree from Wharton you won\u2019t need the MBA. The total cost of an MBA is ~$170,000. When accounting for the lost wages (assume a decent IB job), then it\u2019s probably around $400,000 after taxes. So NYU + MBA is definitely more expensive, and realistically the Wharton undergrad is more impressive than NYU + MBA in most cases. That said, I would probably just avoid the MBA altogether unless you feel financially comfortable and get into a top program.<br>Penn is also a better school overall, so if you decide finance isn\u2019t for you then you\u2019re better positioned.

This a path that can be achieved at either Wharton or Stern, but is of course easier at Wharton.<br>I don\u2019t mean to assert that. Lots of Stern kids do very well.

Stern does very well but Wharton does open a few more doors and generally places better. The difference in placlement is probably not substantial enough to pay $184,000 when it creates a burden for your family. The MBA is interesting because it changes the cost dynamic somewhat. I don\u2019t know the actual numbers (OP could look them up if they care) but if 40% of Stern graduates get an MBA while only 20% of Wharton students do, then there\u2019s a 20% chance that Wharton further saves you around $400k all else equal.<br>I agree with the above posts though, Stern is the safer path. For certain individuals and certain circumstances it would make more sense to attend Wharton given the edge in placement, MBA necessity, and preference for campus/culture, but it\u2019s dependent on the individual and is a riskier path to take. To be clear, I think In this case Stern seems like the better option unless OP really loves Penn, would consider switching majors potentially, and her parents are able to help with the cost without burdening themselves too much.<br><br>", "<b>Username: aoeuidhtns</b><br><br>@dannydalt64 if you\u2019re going into ib, then just go Wharton and be over with it.
