My parent would be able to afford both of these schools so I am just worrying about the housing situation about UPenn because I heard that they only guarantee housing to freshman and most upperclassman have to get housing off campus on their own. Also how would the rigorousness of both of their schools compare?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Dolemite</b><br><br>I would think that UPenn is going to be more rigorous but UPenn does have pretty strong grade inflation so I don\u2019t think the increased rigor isn\u2019t going to greatly effect your GPA.

Additionally there are far more medical research  and volunteer opportunities. UPenn is an excellent private school with vast resources. Penn State is a very large more impersonal place that struggles to get money from the state.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>UPenn, no doubt. For that cost, in a heartbeat. Schreyer is a top Honors college, but the resources at Penn will totally change things for you, especially if like 75% would be pre-meds, you change your mind along the way\u2026 And it\u2019s 1/4th the cost of Penn State!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Angelababy30</b><br><br>@MYOS1634 @ClassicRockerDad would it be difficult to get research opportunities at UPenn since they have such a large amount of graduate students?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Angelababy30</b><br><br>@Dolemite how does the grade inflation work?

On average, it is not close. \u201cComparable\u201d is just what you say to people who were rejected from Penn to make them feel better. They will get an excellent education at Penn State. However, it is not comparable. You should choose Penn.<br>Based on your questions, I strongly suggest that you contact Penn and work this summer with an advisor to understand as much as possible about Penn. It is an extraordinary place, but you have to know how to study, prepare for classes, how not to get behind and how to capture the benefits of all of the clubs and opportunities it offers. There are more opportunities there than hours in the day. You have no idea right now how much you don\u2019t know. The sooner you begin to understand the opportunity you have and how to fully capture the benefits, the better.<br>If you can do that, you will receive a truly world-class education.<br><br>", "<b>Username: naviance</b><br><br>UPenn gives only financial aid, so no minimum GPA is required to keep your aid. How about your aid at Penn State? Is some of that merit money? Is there a minimum GPA to keep that merit money?<br>Are you afraid that Penn will be too hard? I think that Much2learn had some great ideas on contacting an advisor and preparing for college. Penn State has some huge classes and they won\u2019t be any easier than Penn. At either school, you will need to hit the ground running. Penn would not have admitted you if you weren\u2019t up to the work!!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: Dolemite</b><br><br>Penn has all the resources to make sure you succeed but you have to take advantage of them and work hard.

I know a few local Philadelphia kids who were accepted to Penn but not to Schreyer.  So its not just to make kids feel better.  Philadelphia area kids have an easier in to Penn.  1/3 of my son\u2019s graduating class will attend UPenn next year while only one or two (if that) were accepted to Schreyer.<br><br>", "<b>Username: MYOS1634</b><br><br>11: to be fair, OP will be in Schreyer, so peer quality and small classes will be par for the course BUT.. only within Schreyer.<br>At UPenn, it\u2019ll be like that 24/7. All your classes will be good. All the students will be strong. At this point you can\u2019t even imagine the resources you\u2019ll have available, the opportunities you\u2019ll have.

But it\u2019s your first internship, so, it\u2019s unpaid. If you\u2019re at Penn State, your choice is either to drp the unpaid internship and work to make money or take the internship that will advance you in your career.but be without any money earned over the summer which you will need to pay tuition. If you\u2019re at Upenn, no worry, they will give you a stipend to compensate the fact your internship is not paid and so you can get on your career path right away with no financial trouble - basically you have your bread and eat it too. That\u2019s the sort of difference UPenn endowment makes.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Cookies510</b><br><br>@angelababy30  Penn seems like a nobrainer unless you have you heart set on Penn State.  Although, there is an older study (that was updated more recently) by a Princeton economist that found no difference in outcomes between a student who gets into Penn but chooses Penn State.  You will succeed where ever you go and you should examine the differences between the schools in the factors that are most important to you.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Angelababy30</b><br><br>@naviance @Much2learn  I just not sure if i would be able to maintain a high enough GPA for med school application and time preparation of MCAT.

Just call the main number (215) 898\u20137507, and ask for admissions. Once you get to admissions tell the person you have been admitted, and that you have some questions and would like to speak with a counselor.<br>Talk with the counselor about your concern about grades in pre-med. Ask about what a sample schedule would look like. Ask about research opportunities (Basically any student can get involved in research). Ask about opportunities for pre-meds to get involved in clubs. Ask about opportunities to get guidance about issues like what med school applicants need besides a GPA and an MCAT score. Tell them about your other acceptance too. Let them help you.<br>You should go to Quaker days too, but begin getting more information right away. Knowing more will help you make a better decision.<br>Also, consider the fact that most pre-meds at any college decide not to stay in pre-med. None of those students think it will be them switching out. If that happens to you, you are better off at Penn.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Angelababy30</b><br><br>@Much2learn is it worth it to stay overnight since I live in philly?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Much2learn</b><br><br>@angelababy30 Yes, you should stay overnight.

It is possible it is easier to get into Penn for those few. That is a huge opportunity for those kids. Except for that, Penn is much more difficult to get into. They reject lots of kids with perfect grades and test scores.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Angelababy30</b><br><br>@Much2learn I have received a financial aid package from UPenn that the CoA is 2.5k (from the portal online), but do they change later on or is it finalized?

CMU does not have nearly the resources of Penn. For example, the Penn endowment is almost 10 times larger than CMU\u2019s.<br>From my perspective, it is pretty clear that Penn offers you the best opportunity. The important thing for you is getting a lot of guidance on how to capitalize on all of those opportunities. The opportunities they offer will not benefit you if you don\u2019t know they exist or how to access and prioritize them. That is why I recommend that you begin by discussing that with an admissions counselor. Penn has incredible opportunities, but it is also fairly large and complex. Someone with experience can be a big help in guiding you in capturing the best opportunities that are aligned with your interests.<br><br>", "<b>Username: KLSD</b><br><br>Don\u2019t worry about housing at Penn.  Although on paper housing is not guaranteed for your last years, students are able to find on campus housing if they desire to stay on campus (another dorm is being built) and off campus housing is easy to secure if desired.<br>Settle in your freshman year and then apply for assistant research positions.  With both the University Hospital and Children\u2019s Hospital on campus, undergraduates often assist graduate students.

Visit if you are able\u2026<br>A few things to think about at any elite private school.  Will it bother you to be surrounded by students with extraordinary economic advantages?  You will find your own group of friends and they will likely be lifelong friends, but it sometimes takes a while to sort out.  Often the differences are purely economical (dining out, entertainment, extravagant vacations on breaks) and you may find that wealthier students arrive having already taken (are repeating) freshman courses.  Don\u2019t despair, there are plenty of opportunities to work on campus and truly bright self-motivated students have already learned to independently study (a huge advantage).<br><br>", "<b>Username: Dolemite</b><br><br>Also if you are a Philly public high school kid you\u2019ll be a part of the Mayor\u2019s Scholars Program and you\u2019ll get even more support and a peer advisor.<br>Edit: see that you are in the region.

Getting involved in extracurricular activities like research, internships, clubs, travel abroad, etc. are a big part of the experience. Developing a social network is also important.

The students from all four colleges are mixed, which is excellent. My D ended up being good friends with some people who she has about zero in common with on paper, but their personalities clicked. It is priceless when that happens.<br>The rooms are not the best, but it is a right of passage at Penn to say you lived in the Quad. Most students will say that they are glad they did it, but they would not want to do it again. The rooms are not anything special, but they made a lot of friends there.
