{"title": "u chicago vs stanford", "comments": ["<b>Username: The_Corntown_Kid</b><br><br>I\u2019m starting to prep my college apps. For a long time I planned to apply early restricted to Stanford but after visiting the University of Chicago a few weeks ago, I\u2019m not sure which I like better. I really like the both of them a lot and now am trying to figure out which one I want to apply early restricted too. I want to study International Relations and Political Science, and possibly minor in like theater or some sort of art. Any comments or suggestions on the schools?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Srabookworm</b><br><br>I have friends at both universities and have generally heard more positive things about Stanford, although I think the people I know at both universities are happy with their choices. From what I\u2019ve heard, Stanford students are more friendly and the party scene is less intimidating, and I\u2019ve also heard that the California weather is preferable to Chicago\u2019s, although that may be a matter of preference. In general I\u2019ve heard wonderful things about them both, so unless there are particular factors you care about that you haven\u2019t mentioned, it seems like your choice comes down to personal feelings about the environment/culture at each school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Penn95</b><br><br>They are very different schools in terms of campus vibe, social life and academic philosophy. Obviously Stanford is quite more prestigious overall and stronger in your areas of interest, but it is so different from UChicago that if you think you fit in better at UChicago you should seriously reconsider applying to Stanford SCEA. Same goes vice versa. If you fit in well at Stanford chances are u won\u2019t fit in that well at UChicago.<br><br>", "<b>Username: tk21769</b><br><br><br>\"\"<br>I\u2019ve also heard that the California weather is preferable to Chicago\u2019s<br>\"\"<br><br>This really isn\u2019t a matter of opinion. I can\u2019t imagine any sane person preferring Chicago weather.<br>UChicago is quite strong in political science. Stanford may be even stronger, but not by obvious leaps and bounds for undergraduates. For social science overall, UChicago is one of the strongest research universities in the world. Undergraduate instruction in UChicago\u2019s social science and humanities Core classes, which take up about 1/3 of the college  program, is about as good as you\u2019re likely to find anywhere (in terms of course content, class size, and instructor quality.)<br><br>", "<b>Username: artloversplus</b><br><br>To say Stanford is better or more prestigious then Chicago is splitting hairs. They are all top schools and they all have strong programs.  It\u2019s matter of personal preference, do not listen to those anecdotes. Go with your guts.<br><br>", "<b>Username: CalvinCoolidge</b><br><br>Chicago weather will drive you nuts. Go to Stanford. This is coming from a U of C grad.<br><br>", "<b>Username: The_Corntown_Kid</b><br><br>I am from the Bay Area in California so the Stanford weather is definitely more my speed. Both have highly rated international relations programs and are also just as prestigious as the Ivy League schools. Can I hear more about how that atmosphere is and how the students are at each school?<br><br>", "<b>Username: sheepskin00</b><br><br>They\u2019re both powerhouse schools with amazing faculties and students, really the top of the top.  That said, they\u2019re also extremely different in terms of school culture.  Stanford is filled with entrepreneurial, driven, type-A personalities, tempered a bit by the mild weather.  Chicago is filled with introverted scholars who don\u2019t work hard/party hard.  They just work hard.  The stereotype of Chicago as \u201cwhere fun goes to die\u201d is overstated but not without some truth.  No one should go to Chicago unless they\u2019re prepared for the intensity.  The academics are intense, the weather is intense, the students are intense.  It requires a certain mindset in order to thrive there.  You really have to be happy with your nose in a book all the time.  Stanford, on the other hand, is a little less classically egghead.  The students are all extremely talented but the overall vibe of the place is mellower and the pace is a bit slower.  You\u2019re more likely to find big house parties, sports mania, rah rah stuff at Stanford.  Either one will put you in good stead for grad/prof school or employment.  This is a choice about lifestyle, not academics.<br><br>", "<b>Username: preppedparent</b><br><br>Go with your heart. That\u2019s the idea of ED1 and SCEA.<br><br>", "<b>Username: HyperTurbo</b><br><br>If you can visit then it would help a lot IMO. Research the departments on their respective websites.<br>As people above have said, go with your heart. Both are amazing schools. Visiting will help you see for yourself what you wouldn\u2019t be able to see on paper or with stats.<br><br>", "<b>Username: bluesky100</b><br><br>The difference in atmosphere between Uchicago and Stanford is definitely overstated in this thread.  Especially over the past five years, Uchicago has become an increasingly social place with more students who are career driven than ever before.  I was admitted to both this past March, and I ended up choosing Uchicago because of its excellent job placement in finance as well as its incredible econ program.  Choose to apply early to whichever one you feel the most comfortable at, since you cannot go wrong with either one.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Chrchill</b><br><br>Chicago is a world class city with some of the worlds greatest music, theatre, museums and restaurants.  Palo Alto is one giant strip mall.  The area surrounding Palto Alto , however, is scenic and beautiful.  Much better outdoor activities.  Chicago winters are not for the faint of heart. But fall and spring are glorious.  Palo Alto weather is mild year round with no real seasons.<br><br>", "<b>Username: katliamom</b><br><br>I don\u2019t think you could have picked two more radically different universities - one of the few characteristics they share is their excellence.<br>This shouldn\u2019t be a choice between \u201cwhich is better\u201d but more \u201cwhich suits my academic style better.\u201d<br><br>", "<b>Username: Studious99</b><br><br>At U Chicago, ED will certainly give a bigger bump than Stanford REA. For that reason alone, I\u2019d strongly encourage using your ED bullet on Chicago.<br><br>", "<b>Username: theloniusmonk</b><br><br>\u201cPalo Alto is one giant strip mall.\u201d<br>I\u2019m assuming this is sarcasm, Palo Alto is a gorgeous college town, right up there with Cambridge, Ann Arbor and Madison.  Hyde Park doesn\u2019t really compare, now if you want to talk Evanston ok.<br>Here\u2019s what you should do - go to Chicago and Stanford in February, during mid winter break.  I visited Chicago then and the tour guide kept saying, don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll go inside in a minute, we\u2019ll go inside I promise.  Needless to say Stanford\u2019s tour guides rarely say that.<br>Anyway back to the OP, despite the weather, Chicago is a top notch school for your intended majors so if you\u2019re comfortable there, apply EA if you can, if it\u2019s ED, I\u2019d recommend you not apply ED as that will really cut down on your flexibility.  Apply SCEA Stanford as your original plan and RD Chicago and see what happens.<br>The only drawback to Chicago wrt Stanford is that students change majors a lot, and if you decide that you\u2019d like to pursue computer science, then you\u2019re better off at Stanford.  Like really better off.<br><br>", "<b>Username: artloversplus</b><br><br>With all due respect, the CS department is very small and seems insignificant at UofC in comparison to the giants like Stanford, CMU and UCB, but the graduates from CS department at UofC are heavily recruited by the majors in the industry. Of the 20+ graduates in 2013, they all got into companies like Google, Amazon and Apple or the equivalent. I happened to know many of them and they are very bright kids with a lot of CS background on their back before entering UofC. Since then, the class has grown 3 fold until today.  Don\u2019t worry about academic excellence at UofC, except Chicago does not have an Engineering Department.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Rivet2000</b><br><br>I have to admit that UoC was not on my son\u2019s list to apply to (this time last year). He put the list together, so it might have been an oversight of his. The top 4 on his list (specifically crafted for CS) were: Stanford, CMU SCS, MIT, Berkeley. He toured all these schools and Stanford remained #1 in his final analysis. When it comes to a coin-flip type of decision weather wins!   <br><br>", "<b>Username: ThankYouforHelp</b><br><br>@theloniusmonk   I live near Stanford and it is a great place, super pleasant, but Palo Alto is not a \u201cgreat college town.\u201d  It isn\u2019t a college town at all - it is an extremely wealthy suburb full of tech money - all those restaurants and shops are too expensive for students and don\u2019t cater to them.  The Stanford campus is huge, and  removed from town.  Students don\u2019t live off campus or hang out off campus.  In fact, students rarely leave campus at all except to go on outings to San Francisco or maybe to the movies.<br>tl/dr  Palo Alto has almost nothing in common with Ann Arbor, Madison, Cambridge or Hyde Park (but the weather is far nicer).<br><br>", "<b>Username: Rivet2000</b><br><br>Palo Alto is expensive no doubt. But there are many off campus places my son visits. He has also made school sponsored trips to San Francisco, a weekend ski trip to Tahoe, etc. But I must say that during the school year he spends much more time studying than having a \u201ccollege town\u201d experience. He understands why Palo Alto is expensive but his plan is to one day be a customer of that McLaren dealership just off campus, so\u2026<br><br>", "<b>Username: CU123</b><br><br>Of course you do have to get admitted to one of these two excellent schools.<br><br>", "<b>Username: EatwillBAux-K</b><br><br>I don\u2019t know much about Stanford, but Uchicago has very\u2026quirky, and perhaps nerdy atmosphere. It also is more academically oriented.<br><br>", "<b>Username: theluckystar</b><br><br>It\u2019s not a matter of which one is better than the other. They are both two of the best powerhouse research universities in the world. It boils down to which one you feel more right about. In regards to weather, Chicago has the four seasons and winter time really helps build character. Needless to say, Stanford enjoys beautiful weather practically all year round. It\u2019s a tough choice, but it\u2019s an easy choice if you trust your guts.

In addition to a strong traditional faculty in these areas, David Axelrod\u2019s non-partisan Institute on Politics brings dozens of speakers to campus, finds hundreds of internship opportunities all over the country for undergrads, conducts workshops, and brings several politicians to live on campus each term to teach students the practical realities of the business (this term these visiting fellows will include former Democratic governor Kathleen Sibelius and the 2016 campaign manager for Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz).
