{"title": "duke vs berkeley", "comments": ["<b>Username: physicsgod981</b><br><br>Hi there,<br>I am a high school senior (Asian American male) from the Bay Area in California looking for insights and perspectives on the tough decision of where I should attend this fall. I have gotten into many schools (UC Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Duke, Rice, Vanderbilt, etc.), but I have narrowed my choice down to Berkeley and Duke. At Berkeley, I got in for EECS, and at Duke, mechanical engineering, although it is likely that I will switch into ECE/CS (also thinking of minoring in business). I am not 100% sure I want to go down the CS path, but I think it is the most likely area I will pursue, and I have always pictured myself coming back to the Bay Area for graduate school (Berkeley or Stanford) and then to work for a top startup or tech company. However, I have not ruled out other paths like medical school or going into business.<br>For the last two weeks, I have come up with the pros and cons of both schools, and right now, I am leaning toward Duke, but I would greatly appreciate any additional insight. I will be visiting both schools next week. Also, money is not an issue and my parents will have no problems paying the tuition for either school. Here\u2019s how I see both schools.<br>Duke pros:<br><br>Private school (more attention, access to professors who invest more into their undergraduates, easier to gain research opportunities, smaller classes, alumni connections, etc.)<br>Tight-knit community, very supportive, and lots of school spirit (I have played basketball all my life, so going to Duke basketball games is very appealing to me)<br>Research Triangle (not comparable to Silicon Valley, but there\u2019s a fair share of startups and definitely an entrepreneurship culture)<br>Students overall more intellectual, student body more diverse<br>Very flexible education (can add majors/minors/certificates, mix and match easily), also a more comprehensive liberal arts curriculum<br><br>Duke cons:<br><br>Its engineering (CS/ECE) program is not very strong or well-known. Not many high achieving faculty. This is the biggest concern.<br>Unsure of prospects for graduate school/job placement in tech companies (similar to the point above)<br>Social hierarchy/clique nature of the student body<br>Far from home<br><br>Berkeley pros:<br><br>EECS is incredible, top 4 CS program in the nation.<br>Location is prime (Silicon Valley), next to many startups and tech companies<br>Tons of faculty, all of which are very accomplished and doing cutting-edge work<br>Heavy recruiting, getting into graduate school/job at a top company will be very attainable<br>Close to home (about an hour drive)<br><br>Berkeley cons:<br><br>Public school (little support or guidance, large class sizes, \u201cyou are on your own\u201d kind of feeling, professors more focused on research than teaching (often graduate students or TAs will teach))<br>Very competitive (not sure about cutthroat though), and the EECS curriculum is very tough<br>Education not as flexible, will be heavily focused on engineering courses and less on liberal arts<br>Not very diverse, high percentage of Asians, and generally, the student population is not as intellectual<br>Surrounding area is sketchy<br>Community not very strong or supportive, little school spirit<br><br>Overall, Berkeley clearly has the stronger engineering program, and I am confident going to Berkeley would lead me down a pretty certain path for a successful future. However, I also feel like I would like to have a new life experience (Berkeley is super close to home and its student culture is extremely similar to that of my high school) and develop as a person. I definitely see myself enjoying life significantly more at Duke given its student life and community, and I don\u2019t necessarily see its engineering program as a complete nightmare either (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong). As a self-motivated and hard working person, I am confident that I will use Duke\u2019s resources to the fullest and put myself in a good position for graduate school or a job in the Silicon Valley (again, though, I am not sure how much an engineering education at Duke would limit me). Duke also offers great flexibility, and as a top private institution, will give me alternatives if I decide later on that CS is not for me. On the other hand, if I go to Berkeley, it seems very likely that I will be studying pretty much all the time, and while I am not one to shy away from a challenge, I simply don\u2019t think this may be worth it in the long run, as only having a great deal of technical knowledge won\u2019t necessarily get you far in your career. I believe college (undergraduate) is a time to grow as a person, develop some new experiences and life skills, and gain a general education more than anything.<br>This post is getting quite long, so I think I will stop here. If anyone can give me any valuable advice on where I should attend this fall, that would be great. Thank you for the help!<br><br>", "<b>Username: menloparkmom</b><br><br>If Duke is more expensive then go to UCB.<br>Your parents will thank you for saving them big $$  AND you will have more access to jobs in Calif when you graduate.<br>to me its a no brainer.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Massmomm</b><br><br>At Duke, you may have an easier time getting into interesting courses that aren\u2019t in your major, which would lead to a well-rounded education. You\u2019re absolutely right about the importance of a general education. I\u2019m speaking as a strong supporter of a liberal arts education, though, and not everyone shares my view.<br>Cal is notably stronger in the field you want to study, so if you are certain CS is it for you, it may be better to go there.

Unless money is not a consideration or Duke gives you enough assistance to bring it to Berkeley\u2019s level, this should certainly figure into your equation.<br>The other things you need to consider is how certain you want to pursue engineering/CS and how much you want the type of college experience that a school like Duke can provide. They are both great schools, but if you are looking for that quintessential college experience (school spirit, sports, Greek life) and want a strong liberal arts curriculum, Duke is probably a better choice.<br><br>", "<b>Username: privatebanker</b><br><br>You also have to live there and enjoy the people around you. Your education also includes the experiences and people you meet outside of the classroom and labs. Consider the climates of both schools into your equation as well. It\u2019s more of a multi variate regression analaysis than 1 plus 1 equals 2. It\u2019s not a slam dunk  in my estimation.<br><br>", "<b>Username: ParentOfTwo99</b><br><br>My daughter was admitted to UC Berkeley and Duke.  She chose Duke and is currently a freshman.  She is definitely not an engineer type, more of a liberal arts student (although may consider Law or MBA down the road).  It was an easy decision for her.<br>Duke doesn\u2019t have a business undergraduate major/minor.  So keep that in mind.  They do have an MMS certificate (you can research that).<br>If you want to pursue CS and work in Silicon Valley, I\u2019d say go to Berkeley without a doubt.  As you know, Berkeley is known for its CS program.  Duke\u2019s engineering programs are quite rigorous though.  It will be a challenging program.  [Did you know the Duke\u2019s Biomedical Engineering program is a top 4 program in the nation?]  The Duke brand name will be good if you decide on medicine or business grad school.  Duke pre-med students have a high success rate at getting into medical school (something like 90% of students).<br>My daughter loves Duke.  She attended most basketball games this year.  Did tenting for the UNC game.  Great school spirit.  She did get tired of taking the bus to/from East/West campus.  She already has a dorm assignment for Sophomore year.  Close to West Union.  Most of her Fall, 2018 classes start at noon.  She is a night owl, so she\u2019s in heaven.<br>Duke has a lot of Asian students, but more diversity than Berkeley.  There is a social hierarchy on campus - but this is over-blown and only becomes an issue if you let it bother you.  My daughter joined a sorority but only attends certain events - mainly ones that don\u2019t involve alcohol.  She isn\u2019t a party animal.  She joined a few organizations that she really likes and plans to continue with them next school year.<br>Good luck with your decision!<br><br>", "<b>Username: JenniferClint</b><br><br>Duke\u2019s engineering department is small but the faculty is top class.<br>Posting some links that may be of interest:<br>http://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-colleges-for-software-developers-2014-10<br>https://trinity.duke.edu/initiatives/quantitative-initiative<br>https://news.crunchbase.com/news/venture-capitalists-go-college/<br>To put things in perspective, 56 VC investment partners did their undergrad at Berkeley while 32 went to Duke.

We could be nitpicking league tables just to win in an argument, when in fact, there is very little that separates between them, unlike in engineering where Berkeley is considered part of the \u201choly trinity\u201d, standing alongside MIT and Stanford. And, for the record, I did not present those rankings to tell anyone on here that Berkeley is superior to Duke for banking/finance, but to disprove anyone who claims Berkeley would be a terrible training ground and feeder school to banking/finance.<br>I agree Duke is a fantastic school, as a whole. In the same way that I agree Yale, for instance, is an amazing school, in general. But those schools have weaknesses and engineering happens to be the worst of them. Coincidentally, engineering happens to be Berkeley\u2019s one of its strongest departments, and Berkeley \u2013 its name \u2013 is highly reputable, not only in America but throughout the whole universe. Duke, though good as a whole, doesn\u2019t enjoy such grandiose reputation as Berkeley\u2019s, specially in the tech universe. In fact, for many, many serious and highly dedicated, extremely talented engineering aspirants, Duke is not on their radar.<br>If we\u2019re talking about WS, I agree Duke has more presence there.

What they care more about is how to become the next Elon Musk or how to become a successful startup founder, if not to work for those giant tech companies in the Bay Area and make six-figure salary (excluding bonus) as just entrants. That doesn\u2019t make Berkeley engineering inferior to Duke simply because the school doesn\u2019t have the same culture as Duke\u2019s.

Duke as a university tends to care very little about standardized test scores (look at Duke med, Fuqua, etc.) so claiming that Duke is \u201cnotorious\u201d for doing that tells me that you are misinformed. Also, it would be prudent to refrain from making assertions that you cannot back up.<br>2). Standardized test scores are probably more informative than GPAs because they are STANDARDIZED.<br>3).
