{"title": "amherst vs wesleyan", "comments": ["<b>Username: ReCorc3</b><br><br>Hi guys!<br>I am a current high school senior from a medium-sized public school in North Carolina. I was recently accepted to both Amherst College and Wesleyan University! I am absolutely ecstatic about this, as they were two of my top schools, but as such, I am having a very difficult time choosing between the two. I was wondering if any of you could help me out!<br>For a bit of background, I\u2019m not entirely sure what I want to major in yet, but I am extremely interested in psychology, neuroscience, economics, and social thought. I am looking for a very rigorous education with active professors, regardless of what I major in. However, I am also a very artistic person. I have been playing guitar since I was 10 and was in a band for all of high school. I also absolutely adore theater, I\u2019ve been a part of almost every single show through my high school\u2019s theater program, and would really like to continue this in college.<br>Additionally, my family is not wealthy by any means. I would receive very close to full scholarships from both schools, so this makes money not much of an issue for either, but may possibly factor into how I fit in socially? I\u2019m honestly not sure. I am also looking for a school with things to do in the surrounding area, and a relatively active social scene in that regard.<br>tl;dr - I am a motivated high school student with passions for both the arts and sciences. What are y\u2019all\u2019s thoughts on both Wesleyan and Amherst? Thanks so much!<br><br>", "<b>Username: brantly</b><br><br>Wesleyan\u2019s student body is quirkier and artsier overall, although of course not every student fits that description. Amherst has a much smaller enrollment and a much bigger endowment per student.  Sports teams are very prominent on campus.  More students as a percentage of student body are on financial aid at Amherst than Wesleyan.<br>As for location, Amherst is in a nice college town with a great downtown and four other colleges nearby.  Wesleyan is in a suburban town with a small downtown area and no other colleges nearby.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Yaskwhy</b><br><br>Have you visited both schools? I\u2019m familiar with both, and given your self-description, I\u2019d pick Wesleyan in a heartbeat. While it\u2019s true that Amherst is close to two great downtown areas (Amherst and Northampton), within the 5-college area, Amherst College stands out as the least politically progressive institution. The student body at Amherst stands out as quite financially and socially entitled. The academics are top-notch, but it\u2019s hard to imagine you\u2019d actually be comfortable there.<br>Good luck!<br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br>Amherst has made great strides in admitting greater percentages of students from lower income households, but Wesleyan is the larger school and so is liable to have a larger actual number of students that fit that description. Also, Middletown\u2019s downtown is much more diverse. I counted at least four different Asian restaurants on my last visit (Szechuan, Tibetan, Vietnamese and Thai) among many other dining establishments.<br><br>", "<b>Username: BookLvr</b><br><br>They are both EXCELLENT choices!<br>I agree with the advice to visit both schools. I would also research the faculty at both schools.<br>I agree Wesleyan is artsier and probably has the better theater scene.<br>To me, Amherst is the quintessential college town, and is part of the 5 college system which also includes Northampton, another great college town.<br>I disagree that a student with high financial need would feel uncomfortable at Amherst. As @brantly points out above, a higher percentage of the student body at Amherst receives FA than at Wesleyan. 20-25% of the Amherst student body is Pell eligible. Amherst was one of the first elite liberal arts colleges to make significant strides to increase its number of lower income students. This was a very important initiative during the presidency of Anthony Marx and got a lot of positive write-ups in major newspapers. So while yes, there are no doubt some wealthy and privileged students at Amherst (AND at Wesleyan), there are plenty of lower income students as well. It is not rare at all.<br>Amherst is also quite a progressive school in a very progressive town. It is a school that definitely believes in hearing things from all sides. John Kasich recently spoke on the Amherst campus, much to the consternation of some student groups.<br>Good luck with this choice. You really cannot go wrong with either school!<br><br>", "<b>Username: ReCorc3</b><br><br>Thank you for your help! I have only visited Amherst, and going in completely blind to the social atmosphere, I actually liked it a lot! It\u2019s been my top out of all of the schools I\u2019ve visited thus far, albeit not many. I\u2019m trying to visit Wesleyan at some point within the next month, before I have to actually make a decision, but living so far away I might not be able to. Would you say that the Amherst student body is politically and socially progressive? I think I could be comfortable going to school with people from a different financial background, as long as they were open to understanding where I, and others, are coming from. Also, would you happen to know where both Amherst and Wesleyan fall in terms of racial diversity and acceptance?

Having spent time in both Middletown and Amherst in the last year, I\u2019d say the Town of Amherst and the entire Pioneer Valley have A LOT more to offer to the college set.  The area caters to over 30,000 undergrads within about 10 miles of each other with a robust free bus system and myriad choices of restaurants, shops, bars and music venues. The Town of Amherst and nearby Northampton are quintessential New England college towns. The Pioneer Valley area certainly has more varied and diverse restaurant choices than Middletown.  Within one mile of the Amherst College campus, there are 44 different restaurants including Tibetan, Vietnamese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Himalayan, Nepalese, Peruvian, Mexican and a brand new Korean fried chicken.  Downtown Northampton offers even more dining choices.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Rivers4</b><br><br>At Amherst students can audition for any of the five college\u2019s theatre productions:<br>https://www.fivecolleges.edu/theater/<br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br>According to many, many posts on the CC Forum, the dining hall food is better at Wesleyan.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Meddy</b><br><br>My daughter was blessed to get into both of these wonderful schools last year. Her interests at the time were not dissimilar to yours. Up to that point in her life, she\u2019d never been faced with a more difficult decision than having to turn down such wonderful schools like Wesleyan, for Amherst College.<br>IMHO Wesleyan is a theatre person\u2019s dream! Lin Manuel Miranda and so very many more of their talented and successful Alumni have become such a force in the entertainment industry and this makes opportunities for internships and networking, rich and exciting. Also this year former Governor Hickenlooper of Colorado has thrown his hat in the ring as a Presidential candidate. He is a very smart and succesful businessman who has an interesting autobiography that speaks to the time spent and many people he met while attending school there.<br>Amherst is magical. I know, I know. It is not perfect, but the education and resources are incredible. My daughter has not had an easy first year. Health issues, housing issues, but once she sets foot in the classroom, she is in her element, she has found her people. And no they aren\u2019t all just like her. She has friends and classmates that are conservative politically and although she is not, the brilliant discussions and intelligent arguments made are very stimulating to her. These are her people. Not necessarily all the same opinions or beliefs, but so very interesting and bright. This has been the highlight of our facetime conversations with her.<br>She loves most of the professors and her hard work is rewarded well in high marks. The emails and attention professors give her is beyond what she received from her public high school education. She has had opportunities to participate in a book club at the home of the President of Amherst College and has had professors give her books during office hours that they thought she would enjoy. Her Advisor has also had her and his other students over to his home for dinner.<br>The towns are not in big cities. Neither one is going to be Los Angeles or New York kind of exciting. Amherst is a quaint little New England town. Most of the fun happens on campus at Amherst and occasionally at one of the other schools in the Five College Consortium.<br>Go visit. It is a must to attend Admitted Students days for both. They really do it right. You will have a feeling as to what your future possible classmates may be like. You will get a vibe of the current students and campus. You will make the right choice.

I only placed my deposit at Amherst because it was atop the LAC rankings at the time, and I was off at boarding school and caught up in the rankings silliness. Deep down inside, however, I knew Wes was a better fit; I came from a relatively homogenous high school, and I wanted something different in college. At that time, Wes was clearly a better fit, both by the numbers, and in terms of actual feel. Today, Amherst at least rivals Wes by the numbers, and on paper, it exceeds it in terms of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic diversity indicators. That said, the numbers only tell part of the story. I applied to college pre-internet and I never saw any of the schools I applied to until the day I moved in as a freshman. I knew Edward\u2019s B. Fiske\u2019s (Wes Alum, by the way) Selective Guide to Colleges like the back of my hand.  Today, the info I have gleaned from that guide, conversations with alum and current students at both schools, Niche, Unigo, etc., lead me to conclude that, while both places have evolved, they have not really changed that much in terms of where they fall on the campus climate spectrum. As I help youngsters navigate the process you are going through right now, I am struck by how long it takes for the culture and/or climate of an academic institution to evolve. Amherst may be more heterogenous than it was a few decades ago, but at its core, it still has some way to go before its \u2018inclusion\u2019 ranking matches its diversity numbers. Wesleyan may not be as \u2018progressive\u2019 as it once was, but at its core, it comes much closer to living up to the \u2018diversity university\u2019 moniker frequently associated with it than so may other schools its size. Similarly, institutions like Colby, Middlebury, and Hamilton, for example, are more diverse than they once were, but how much those institutions have \u2018really\u2019 changed is up for debate. How much any of that matters to you is something only you can decide. As others have pointed out, you can get a superb education at either place. If it matters to you (not that I get the sense it does), Wesleyan has fallen even further behind in the rankings. For what its worth, I\u2019d be less reluctant to go to Amherst today, but mostly because I\u2019d graduate with no loans to repay.

You should visit, talk to recent grads, students of color and make decisions that are based less on conjecture.<br>https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/diversity<br><br>", "<b>Username: AmazingBlue</b><br><br>I\u2019ve recently been back to both Middletown and Amherst after being away for decades.  I was pleasantly surprised by both.<br>Middletown never really felt \u201csuburban\u201d to me.   it felt like a small New England city fallen on hard times.  In the 1980s there were a handful of nice places to go, but not many.  Middletown now feels much more economically diverse, in the sense that there are people walking around who are not affiliated with Wesleyan but have plenty of money to spend.  As people have observed, there are several kinds of restaurants and other shops in Middletown.  They\u2019re selling things like fancy chocolates and cool clothes   But I still think Middletown has much less nightlife than one might want.  (Wesleyan may offer it\u2019s own nightlife.)<br>In the 1980s, most visitors would have thought that Amherst was \u201cnicer\u201d than Middletown, especially if you liked stores and shops that sold expensive housewares and preppy clothes.  Back then, I had an extremely negative reaction to Amherst.  It seemed extremely precious and dull.  But now it feels more vibrant.  It\u2019s still very beautiful but now there are more kinds of people on the streets, more ethnic restaurants, etc.  That said, the town still has a fantasy land quality to it.  There are very few poor people around.  Northampton feels more like a real city and it\u2019s a short drive away.<br>One thing that has changed the town of Amherst is the evolution of the student bodies at UMass and Amherst College.  UMass feels more like a big time state university than it did back then.  And Amherst has a vastly more diverse student body than it did back then.<br><br>", "<b>Username: AmazingBlue</b><br><br>Question: Does Amherst produce alumni who go into the performing arts?  Wesleyan and Amherst both have amazingly impressive Wikipedia pages listing alumni, but Wesleyan seems to have far more musicians and actors in its list.  Amherst has far fewer under the age of 50.<br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br>I think a lot of this can be traced back to choices each college made back when they decided to go co-ed (Wesleyan for the second time) in the late 1960s. Both were very concerned that they would not be able to pull enough overlaps from the Seven Sisters, widely considered the female equivalent of the Ivy League. This impacted Amherst in particular since it was identified so closely with Smith and Mt. Holyoke. So, it spent many years recruiting women by holding total enrollment at 1200 students by cutting the number of males. My sense is that the women were expected to match the same academic profile as their male counterparts and were heavily weighted in favor of the social sciences and English.<br>Wesleyan which was swimming in money, thanks to some canny investments in tech stocks (sound familiar?), made a much different calculation. The closest female college was Vassar, some eighty miles away. A tiny, all-male college by comparison, steeped in a kind of pious, Prescott Bush-style Republicanism, Wesleyan could afford to \u201cgo big\u201d. And high on its to-do list was an expansion of its arts offerings. The result was a mammoth architectural undertaking by a prestige firm (headed by perhaps the prestige architect of his time, Kevin Roche), the Wesleyan Center for the Arts (CFA). I don\u2019t think anyone anticipated at the time the profound effect a capital investment would have on the number of both men and women who would find themselves attracted to the arts while at Wesleyan over the next forty years.<br><br>", "<b>Username: lloyddobler85</b><br><br>If financial resources of each school are a consideration, Amherst\u2019s endowment of $2.4 billion certainly outpaces Wesleyan\u2019s $1 billion despite having 1000 fewer students.<br>@ReCorc3 Has a decision been made?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Meddy</b><br><br>@AmazingBlue Yes, Amherst does produce alumni that go into the performing arts. I have seen where they even have Open Auditions on campus for plays that alumni are producing. So, having alumni in the arts is one thing, having them active at their alma mater is even better. The Five College Consortium also adds additional opportunities at the other campuses for auditions and classes.<br>Wesleyan has long been known as the place to be for undergrad film studies and they have quite the active alumni network in entertainment. It has a top 10 program film program which if I\u2019m not mistaken was birthed by the iconic Professor Basinger, who I believe has recently passed on the torch, but may still have ties to the program  Most recently you will hear of Lin-Manuel Miranda giving back to his alma mater. I think their opportunities in the arts are pretty rich.<br>As with any school, it\u2019s what you make of it. I love Amherst.

If instructional budgets are any consideration (and, why would they not; these are colleges, not sports camps), Wesleyan outspends Amherst by nearly 2:1. According to their respective 2017 Annual Reports, the latest available for both colleges, Wesleyan spent $103,700,000 on the broad category of \u201cinstruction\u201d while Amherst spent only $56,000,000.<br>https://www.wesleyan.edu/finance/annualreporting/2016-2017.pdf<br>https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/2017_annual%2520report.pdf<br><br>", "<b>Username: KnightsRidge</b><br><br>As a Williams grad, I\u2019d say these two excellent LACs are so close and for OP there is no wrong choice.

All three lists are really impressive, but if you spend time reading about the alumni in more artistic and public service oriented fields, Wesleyan really seems to stand out.<br>If nobody told you that Wesleyan was supposed to be in third place, well behind Amherst and Williams, would you think it was in third place based on the descriptions of the programs or the alumni lists?  I doubt it.  (I guess you might if you were more focused on finance and industry, but I\u2019m not even sure about that.)<br>Also if you watch videos of students at the Little Three, the Wesleyan ones just seem a little more entertaining.  Having an extra 1000 students at Wesleyan must make it slightly easier to get into, on average, but the people who get in sure seem to have more energy on screen, as a group, than the ones who get into Amherst and Williams.  There are a lot of funny Wesleyan students.  I\u2019m sure there are some funny Amherst and Williams students too, but let\u2019s just say they don\u2019t have as big of a presence on the internet.<br>I do like the Amherst campus, though.<br>That view is crazy.<br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br>That southern view over the War Memorial may well become Amherst\u2019s most enduring landmark.
