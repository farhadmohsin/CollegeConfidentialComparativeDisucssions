Also generally speaking, I\u2019d say public universities, including the top-ranked ones (Michigan, UNC, Wisconsin, several UCs, William and Mary, etc.), will generally be more diverse, especially when socioeconomic diversity is considered.

Big cities like LA can get pretty expensive if you go off campus to have fun, as is off-campus housing. For example, UCLA students with bigger budgets can afford to live much closer to campus than students commuting from home or relegated to, say, Palms or Culver City for cost reasons.<br>If you want to study socioeconomic cohesiveness on a college campus, you should also consider things like the percentage of students living on campus, the accessibility and reliability of public transit (or campus shuttles), the cost of living in the area (how much does it cost to go out to dinner with friends or to do a weekly happy hour?), and the cost of events on campus. Elite colleges like Swarthmore often make all events on campus free to students, whereas that is not the case everywhere; $20 for a music concert here and $15 for a play there can add up.<br><br>", "<b>Username: hardworking99</b><br><br>I appreciate all of the insightful feedback.

Wisconsin is not an especially diverse state, outside of the cities, and with about 60% of the undergrads being Wisconsin residents, that means the overall undergrad student body is not as diverse as a public flagship for instance, in parts of California. At the same time, there is a fair amount of socio-economic and cultural diversity at UW, in the sense that first gen kids who had not left their small hometown until they came to Madison, are attending UW.  Minnesota residents make up about another another 15% or so of the student body, and the remaining 25% comes from everywhere else, plenty from Chicago suburbs but also from east and west coast. Broadly, kids at UW are mostly \u201cMidwest nice.\u201d In our experience, one of the big \u201cmarkers\u201d of affluence on a college campus is whether, and what kind of, car a student has on campus. Having a car at UW is not a popular option because parking is pain and in bad weather, students can hop a free bus running a circuit throughout campus \u2013 so you aren\u2019t aware of economic stratification based on what kind of car somebody has. My kid was in greek life, which is around 10% of the undergrad student population. For those 3000 or so kids in greek life, that is the core of their social experience, but they are pretty irrelevant to the rest of campus.

Tie-breaker is percentage of students who do not received need-based aid.<br>If you\u0092ve visited a lot of these campuses, you\u0092d likely not find many surprises in this data. The only clear generalizations to be made are that, on the whole, midwestern schools do not seem attractive to private school students (or they simply aren\u0092t accepted \u0096 which I find unlikely), and southern schools (with the exception of Agnes Scott) offer (or need to offer) significantly less than average in terms of need-based aid. One caveat that must be attached to the data is that some schools (some that I know of for sure are Bard, Mount Holyoke, Smith, and Macalester) offer merit-based aid to significant portions of their entering class (as much as 10%) \u0096 some of those students, upon receiving the merit aid award, no longer qualify for need-based aid, and hence wouldn\u0092t appear in this picture.<br>This data picture as always is incomplete. While it reflects \u0093entitlement\u0094 on the campus as above, it does not reflect the impact on campus feel of low-income students. A school could offer lots of rather small \u0093need-based\u0094 grants to attract students away from the competition, without really changing the make up or feel of the campus. (Macalester has a reputation for doing this \u0096 whether it is just or not, I have no idea.) One way to correct for that is to subtract the percentage of students on Pell Grants (with family incomes below 35% of the national average) from the total. All of a sudden, the extremes become more extreme, and the picture (I believe) more clear.<br>Numbers Represent the \u0093Entitlement\u0094 Index minus Pell Grant Shares:<br><br> Davidson 119-6 113<br> Washington and Lee 113-3 110<br> Trinity 119-13 106<br> Bates 108-9 99<br> Middlebury 105-8 97<br> Kenyon 105-8 97<br> Williams 104-9 95<br> Colby 100-7 93<br> Connecticut 102-11 91<br>Univ. of the South 103-13 90<br>Bowdoin 98-10 88<br>Furman 96-9 87<br>Skidmore 98-13 85<br>Haverford 96-13 83<br>Wesleyan 96-14 82<br>Amherst 96-16 80<br>Whitman 88-9 79<br>Swarthmore 91-13 78<br>Franklin & Marshall 87-9 78<br>Barnard 95-18 77<br>Pomona 89-12 77<br>Colgate 86-10 76<br>Scripps 88-14 74<br>Dickinson 85-12 73<br>Sarah Lawrence 82-12 70<br>Vassar 81-12 69<br>Colorado 85-17 68<br>Lafayette 76-8 68<br>Hamilton 82-15 67<br>Denison 79-12 67<br>Wellesley 80-16 64<br>Bucknell 75-12 63<br>Gettysburg  74-12 62<br>Bryn Mawr 76-15 61<br>Carleton 71-10 61<br>Union 75-15 60<br>Oberlin 76-17 59<br>Claremont-McKenna 71-15 56<br>Harvey Mudd 65-12 53<br>Macalester 65-15 50<br>Bard 68-20 48<br>Mount Holyoke 68-21 47<br>Depauw 59-13 46<br>Smith 70-24 46<br>Occidental 69-27 42<br>Agnes Scott 66-26 40<br>Grinnell 53-13 40<br>Centre 57-18 39<br>Wabash 38-19 19<br><br><br>", "<b>Username: circuitrider</b><br><br>^Not at all sure what it is about subtracting Pell grant recipients that would cause the percent of students from private secondary schools to shoot up to 119%?<br><br>", "<b>Username: otisp</b><br><br>Before anybody freaks out over these lists, remember they reflect data from 2002-2003.<br><br>", "<b>Username: jym626</b><br><br>Yes, these are old threads and old lists, but they are a hoot!!<br><br>", "<b>Username: notigering</b><br><br>Yes!

Even if it was current, the assumption that private high school always equals privilege is troubling to me.  I know for Notre Dame, @ 2/3 of that \u201cprivate school\u201d number are Catholic schools.  The same may be true for Georgetown and BC. If you know anything about Catholic elem/high schools, there are many (possibly most) that are among the most racially and socio-economically diverse out there. I wonder if the same is true for charter schools, which also fall under the \u201cprivate\u201d umbrella? Private high school does not necessarily equate with privileged.<br>Even if you buy into the stereotype that rich person = elitism, you will find people like that at all types of schools. My daughter grew up in a town that is affluent with little diversity.  But she went to the regional Catholic high school, which is VERY diverse racially, culturally and socio-economically.  She learned very quickly that many people could not afford to do the things that the kids in our town took for granted. She was friends with a kid who lived in a hotel room with his dad.  Another friend in whose culture it was typical to keep chickens in their back yard. Other friends who taught her about their experiences with racism. Basically kids she would barely, if ever, have encountered in our public school.  If I think about who was more \u201celitist\u201d going into college, my D or her friends in our public school (who spent their years with kids very like themselves, and worrying about having the latest Tory Burch bag) \u2013 I can guarantee you it wasn\u2019t my D.

Most of them went to OOS public Us.<br>There are all types of private high schools and all types of public high schools.

That being said, I found there to be somewhat of an elitist attitude surrounding that school, but not from the students.  Their engineering program is very competitive and felt a little cutthroat to me. And the campus wasn\u2019t even remotely diverse.

So perhaps it is not too surprising that some students may be more competitive or even cutthroat as a result.<br><br>"]}
