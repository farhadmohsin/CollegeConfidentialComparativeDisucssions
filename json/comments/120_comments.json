I think it\u2019s great to gain actual CS experience and earn some money to pay off the debt. However, I also see the benefits of having a curriculum not focused on co-op. I can see benefits in both, and one style experience does not really stand out as \u201csuperior.\u201d I certainly like that according to a lot of rankings, Northeastern has the #1 co-op in the country. I think that must carry some weight in the way the university builds connections with co-op partners.<br>The only other school on my list with Co-op is GT.

I really enjoyed every experience I have had with basic CS and want to pursue it more. However, as a student, I am all over the place when it comes to academic interests and I didn\u2019t think I could see myself at a \u201cTech\u201d school. Whereas the culture and well-rounded academics of UMich really appealed to me. I also love theatre and want to pursue it at the school I attend, and I saw that UMich had a relative abundance compared to Tech.<br>UMich is still in contention due to the fact that attending the school is still financially possible for me, even with the massive price difference.

Just choose a decent school and get your degree. 99% of what you learn will be on the job. BTW, a $114k scholarship at Northeastern still sucks.

While there is general truth that it\u2019s not quite as important where you go to school and that the name of your degree won\u2019t mean anything, the level of work, the level of peers around you, and initial companies recruiting you does change with significant differences in CS programs. The reason school name doesn\u2019t matter is because experience is the #1 factor. That\u2019s partially affected by where you go to school. I think there\u2019s an argument to be made that the student has more to do with it than the school, and top students tend to go to top schools. But that doesn\u2019t discount the effect of the school you go to entirely IMO.<br>It\u2019s certainly too highly focused on generally though, and a difference between the #10 and #30 CS school is negligible at best. But if you\u2019re looking at #15 vs #100/#150/#200, yeah there\u2019s a difference, though not night and day.

Also, that study doesn\u2019t account for volume (UM produces quite a few CS grads each year), and of course is focusing on just one region of the US. I would suspect a higher percentage of UM grads choose Silicon Valley since Northeastern grads are probably more likely to stay in Boston or go to NYC for example, simply based on locality of the schools.

It\u2019s very much a nontraditional college experience, for better or worse depending on your preferences. I personally liked it for it not being focused on sports or greek life (only 10% of the student population) and loved having Boston around to explore over a college town feel that Ann Arbor has (one of the best of that type of course though). So again it really just depends what you want.<br>Specifically with co-op everyone is on campus for the first 3 semesters and many stay in Boston, especially for their first co-op. Those first 3-5+ semesters lay the social groundwork and people understand that you go on co-op and all, and often people make more of an effort to stay in touch as a result. I think in that way friendships at Northeastern do sometimes require more effort but more closely resemble how socializing works in your mid 20\u2019s where you make the effort for the people who matter to you.

It seems that they do have a decent amount of breadth (though not at the scale of UMich). How would the post-undergrad opportunities differ from a school lower in the ranks?<br><br>", "<b>Username: Sunny66</b><br><br>I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been great for their CS grads \u2013 it\u2019s one of the top programs in the country. I will let others in the CS industry chime in. I did not attend any of the schools under consideration.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Greymeer</b><br><br>If UMass Amherst and \u201cAmherst\u201d are the same thing.

What you should focus on is FIT and cost. Is full pay at UMichigan really affordable for your parents? Even after this stock market crash? I\u2019d look into it carefully.<br>As to culture and fit - they are very different. Northeastern is a more non-traditional college experience in a cosmopolitan city. UMichigan is a tradition football experience in the midwest. What do you prefer? You are from Mass - do you like Mass and professional New England sports that are the focus in Boston?  Do you want your college experience to be somewhere totally different than where you grew up? That\u2019s what you should think about.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Knowsstuff</b><br><br>@sushiritto. I will do my best.<br>First thing is can your parents \u201ccleanly\u201d pay the fees for college for any of your choices. Don\u2019t assume. Sit down and ask. My first look quickly at this was GT was a great combination. All the schools have co-op even Michigan. But at Michigan coops aren\u2019t that big of a thing internships are. You can start at the lowest level at any of these schools and work your way up. Keep something in mind. GT and Michigan are very, very tough schools even for the best students. Read that sentence again!<br>Michigan is very, very lenient on switching majors or between schools. Not all schools are. You can do any combination of just about anything you can figure out.<br>As far as doing your own thing my son in engineering has about $15,000\" grants for a student org he started , put on a complete conference last year and since canceled it is going online next Sunday for free on Augmented Reality and Mixed Reality and it\u2019s real word uses. (PM me if you want a link. Microsoft, Ford etc are talking and doing demo\u2019s).<br>His friends on his board for the student org are basically all CS students. Their internships last year were Microsoft, NASA , Amazon, and some tech company in Silicon Valley. 4/4 on this board. Not horrible.<br>You are right. The culture at Michigan is different compared to these other schools. No question about it. Rare to have a large Public school that the LSA student body is 3.9 unweighted with 32-35 Act. That\u2019s most schools engineering students. It\u2019s a very academic school. This gets overlooked.<br>They also will support anything you want to do. They have the money to spend on their kids. My son is a living example. Need more information PM me.<br>Name brand, no question. GT and Michigan have that in spades and also their alumni are powerful.<br>But for CS it\u2019s such in high demand that you could go to Pundunk University and get a job.<br>So it\u2019s comes down to what your parents can truly afford and what you want your 4 years to look /feel like.<br>NE is an excellent school. It\u2019s just a different campus then Michigan\u2019s. Very few schools have 115,000 at football games. Both schools will give you a different 4 year experience. Didn\u2019t say one is better but just different.<br>Look up things like clubs and student organizations in your interest to compare between schools.<br>So my son doesn\u2019t like coding. But in his 3 years has taken Java, C plus plus, Python , R, Sql, something else. I can tell you of a 2 day, 13 hours CS assignment in in the beginning CS mentioned. 1 problem took that long to figure it out correctly!! Lol. (the usual problems don\u2019t take that long\u2026lol.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Uzername</b><br><br>@suzyQ7<br>You make an excellent point. Northeastern provides a great fit for me as it is in the city ,close to home, at a very reasonable price. However, it hurts to overlook the brand name of schools like UM or GT after working hard in high school.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Uzername</b><br><br>@Knowsstuff Thank you for your very thorough reply!<br>Obviously, paying close to 40k- 70k a year for tuition is rarely going to be clean for anyone. However I am fortunate that all of these schools are legitimate options for me.<br>One thing that especially drew me in was your son\u2019s and his friend\u2019s summer internships. They certainly were not too shabby! Obviously all of them must have been very smart, but in your opinion, would acquiring such amazing opportunities just be easier at UMich compared to the other schools on my list. (Mainly NEU).<br><br>", "<b>Username: PengsPhils</b><br><br>If it\u2019s comparing CS internships from all of these, you can find a list of co-op employers at Northeastern here featuring a very similar set of names:<br>https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/experiential-learning/undergraduate/co-op-overview/<br>Anecdotally I know Northeastern people in the bay from my time at Apple, Reddit, Tesla, Yelp, and Lyft.<br><br>", "<b>Username: Knowsstuff</b><br><br>@Uzername. Those were just the example of the random students on the board of the student org he co-founded. Keep in mind. You don\u2019t go to any school and just get these internships. These kids are workers and leaders in other avenues at Michigan also<br>They have all made a name for themselves in one way or another. Companies want to see you engaged in the college community. The school didn\u2019t get them anything. The students did. The one with Nasa also won the MIT hackathon last year\u2026all these kids are smart. You have to be to go here or actually any of your choices.<br>For my sons group,the actual day they registered with the university several Alumni reached out to them. Some from Silicon Valley. He still has no clue how they actually knew.<br>Can\u2019t think he just got lucky. The university has bent over backwards to help him/their group. Professors have become mentors and approached them since they all had similar interests. I have heard this from other parents also.<br><br>", "<b>Username: DadTwoGirls</b><br><br>\u201cYou are really focusing on the difference between the quality of these CS programs, but as mentioned, those differences are minimal. What you should focus on is FIT and cost.\u201d<br>This is what I think also. I have worked with great software engineers from MIT, Michigan, and U.Mass. You can get a great education at any of these schools.<br>I would save my money and get a great education at U.Mass.<br>Your hard work in high school will make you substantially better prepared to do well at whichever of these schools you attend.<br><br>", "<b>Username: suzyQ7</b><br><br><br><br><br> Uzername:<br>\"\"<br>@suzyQ7<br>You make an excellent point.

Forget about the brand names. Do you like the New England vibe or do you want to try something different (not necessarily better, just different)? Do want to do Big Football and Midwestern charm - is that a draw? Or do you want to hang out in Boston with the professional sports vibe, diverse population, but expensive cost of living?  Northeastern is not a traditional college experience -and you have to really want that to love it there. The kids that go there wanting that and knowing that - love it. The kids that don\u2019t, look to transfer because there are not huge frat organized sports events every weekend (obviously, they didn\u2019t do their research). If you want the big college campus and sports scene - I would go with UMichigan (if your parents have the extra $100k), and not UMass because with UMichigan you will get the full \u2018different\u2019 experience of moving of out New England.<br><br>", "<b>Username: sushiritto</b><br><br>LSA at Michigan has UROP, the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, which was started in 1988:<br>https://lsa.umich.edu/urop/about-us.html<br>Michigan has a $12 Billion endowment.
