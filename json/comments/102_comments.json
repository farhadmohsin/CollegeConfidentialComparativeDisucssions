Berkeley isn't known to care if its students can graduate or not; when it comes to athletes, all they care is if they can bring them wins which lead to more MONEY. Remember the scandal couple/few years ago about these athletes getting A for a class they didn't even show up much?? You know why it was A but not B or C (which would make it a lot less obvious)?

Of course, Berkeley had said they fixed the problem. To me, the only way to prevent this sort of things happening again is to stop admitting athletes that are likely to fail.

Stanford BB team's graduation rate is actually higher than that of the entire student body. In the 90s, the graduation rate was 100% when nobody was drafted early before graduation. The average SAT of Stanford's athletes are usually #1, #2, or possibly #3 among division I programs (excluding Ivies because they don't provide their stats), depending on which year (other two schools are Rice and Northwestern) we are looking at. Go look at bios of the athletes on Stanford's athletics' page and they definitely look pretty good students to me.
