So I was recently accepted to Brown, and am looking to concentrate in CS-econ and neuroscience. However, I now realize, after talking to my parents, that the cost of going to an Ivy League school like Brown is $80k/year, or $320k total. At my state school (UMass Amherst), it would cost me closer to $25k/year, or $100k total.
My parents are willing to pay for half of the Brown degree, or $160k, OR pay for my entire state school tuition and give me an extra $200k for future investing in whatever I want (don’t ask, it’s just the way it is). If I went to Brown, I would pay for the other half of the degree by doing work-studies and working through the summers. If I were to go to the state school, I would like to put that $200k in growth stock funds or a high-yield savings account and then use it for grad school (MBA probably, looking to start my own biotech company).
Is an Ivy League degree really worth that much more than a state school degree? How should I make my choice between the two? I could also go to Northeastern or UCSD for $45k/year.

2.<<<mom2twogirls>>>
How would you even come up with the other half of the money for Brown?

3.<<<iamnotaaron>>>
@mom2twogirls  As stated in my question, I would “…pay for the other half of the degree by doing work-studies and working through the summers. If I were to go to the state school, I would like to put that $200k in growth stock funds or a high-yield savings account and then use it for grad school (MBA probably, looking to start my own biotech company).”
I would probably have to take out loans to pay for the rest of the $160k.

4.<<<iamnotaaron>>>
@JenniferClint What is your rationale?

5.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Work study and summer jobs aren’t going to close that gap.

6.<<<twogirls>>>
You will not be able to earn $160,000 through work study and working summers.

[/quote]

No you won’t. Work Study is about $1500/semester. If you work summers you can probably raise $3500. That’s $20k over 4 years (assuming you don’t spend any). You’d be $140k short (not including interest). You have to pay up front, though, so unless your parents are willing to borrow $160k+ for you there’s no way for you to pay that much. And you shouldn’t anyway. Go to the state school.

8.<<<iamnotaaron>>>
@twogirls @momofsenior1 You’re right. I would have to take out loans to pay for the rest. So a Brown degree is not worth that much?

9.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
$40k per year is extremely optimistic for a year of part time work.  If it were that easy to earn that much, there would be far fewer poor people, and far fewer people who have difficulty affording college.

10.<<<privatebanker>>>
You can’t take out more that 5500 as anfirst year to 7500 as a senior in loans  The extra loan amount will require a co-signer parent.

11.<<<twogirls>>>
You can’t take out such big loans. You can take out $5500 your first year…your parents would have to take out the rest. Go to your state school.

12.<<<momofsenior1>>>
No way.
Many schools limit the number of hours students can do work study.    10-15 hours/week would be a lot for a CS major to take on as a full time student.
The average CS summer internships pays $21/hour plus housing.

13.<<<momofsenior1>>>
IMO, it’s totally not worth the debt.

14.<<<menloparkmom>>>
@iamnotaaron
you, as an 18 yr old college student, can’t take out loans amounting to $160,000, anymore than you could walk into a Tesla showroom and drive away with a new S model.
No one would lend that amount to someone without the financial resources that prove that they can pay that $$ back, with interest.
As others have said, go to your state school.

15.<<<privatebanker>>>
UMass Amherst has a phenomenal CS program. And the AI work and rankings are vastly superior to Brown or NEU. Was looking at the CS department at Hamilton. And believe it or not, the department chair and noted prof is a UMass CS grad .

16.<<<aunt_bea>>>
You’re not really listening to what the other posters are telling you.
On your own, you are NOT allowed to take out that much in loans.
NO bank/loan agency is going to loan an 18 y.o. kid, $160K.
You are allowed to take out $5500 per freshman year ($2750 per semester), $6500 in sophomore year ($3250 per semester) and $7500 junior/senior year ($3750 per semester).
That’s $27K and is nowhere near the $160K you need.

17.<<<Happytimes2001>>>
Sounds like your parents are really trying to force your hand. I would sit down with them and ask them for more data. Taking out $140K is ridiculous. Yet, they are willing to give you 200K to invest? So they are essentially saying do what we want and we will pay you or do what you want and take on the financial burden yourself? Really???
I think Northeastern is a very good option. While not Brown, the co-op program is stellar and people often get jobs that are far better than what a college graduate could get on their own. Plus you would have the opportunity to explore various facets of industries which you are interested in.
Honestly, I’m still stuck on the thinking behind the payments for various schools.

18.<<<menloparkmom>>>
Its kinda funny [ admittedly not for the OP], but over the years I have seen SO many posts from “prestige” focused parents who are HAPPY to pay full tuition for an “Ivy” league college, but WON’T pay the same amount for a “less prestigious” college.
this kinda turns that thinking on its head.

19.<<<nypapa>>>
Another thing to keep in mind is that taking out plus loans would start to accrue interest from the start of freshman year. Those loans are going to limit what one can do after graduation, especially in terms of going to graduate school or working on a start up.
Also, being a cash poor student at Brown could make the overall experience less enjoyable while extra pocket money at UMASS would allow room for little luxuries like for spring break, summer overseas adventures and research internships.

20.<<<washugrad>>>
Wait, how are you getting UCSD for $45K a year if you are out of state but not qualifying for need-based aid at Brown?

21.<<<menloparkmom>>>
"how are you getting UCSD for $45K a year "
that is the amount just for tuition for OOS students.

22.<<<Itisatruth>>>
This will not be helpful to OP, but for any parents or students reading this in the future: Please run your NPCs and have these conversations before making application decisions!! OP shouldn’t have to be facing this decision at this point. If parents weren’t going to pay for &gt;50% of Brown, and NPC revealed little to no need-based aid, someone should have explained this to OP sooner (including the realities of loan limits, work study, and student earnings)!
Also, UMass is great for CS. Take the $200k and don’t look back. You’ll have a great experience and get a great education.

23.<<<bluebayou>>>
UC is definitely not worth it OOS.

24.<<<CupCakeMuffins>>>
Your parents are in a position to send you to an Ivy without any debt. I say negotiate with them. Make a compelling case for them to give you a shot at best education available, unless you rather attend UMass and take one time payment for demonstrating obedience. To be fair, at the end of the day it’s their money so if they don’t agree, state school it is.

25.<<<PengsPhils>>>
UMass Amherst sounds like the best school for your studies regardless of finances. I’d take that 200K while it’s still on the table!

26.<<<iamnotaaron>>>
For those wondering why I would be paying $45k/year for UCSD: there’s an extremely unique fund/program in my town that helps me pay for my tuition if I were to go to a UC school. Factored in, I would pay $45k/year for UCSD. I must stress that this is an extremely unique scenario, and I doubt many other towns have this same form of UC “camaraderie”. (My have a lot of UC alumns in my town). @washugrad

27.<<<anon145>>>
your parents are telling you take the cash and invest it. like Moses being offered coal…

28.<<<merc81>>>
Your decision really doesn’t involve a comparison of a highly selective private college to a generic state school, but rather to a state school (UMass) that is notably strong in at least one of your areas of interest (CS). That stated, I’d recommend you still consider various aspects of all types, as with any major decision.

29.<<<privatebanker>>>
@CupCakeMuffins
“make a compelling case for them to give you a shot at the best education available…demonstrating obedience…state school it is”
What info do you have to indicate that a CS major would receive a better education at any of these schools  than the University of Massachusetts at Amherst ?
OP- please disregard the toxic elitism that  can permeate these threads, it reeks of immaturity and lack of real world experience in certain fields.
A “state school” that is a flagship research uni,  is equal in CS reputation, considered as a preeminent player  in AI “the future of computing”, is indeed an excellent option.
Also the best food options in country.  Tomorrow night their ice hockey team begins the final four tournament to decide the national championship.  Fun stuff. Lol.
Don’t fall for the hype.  Check out the chair of the Hamilton cs department. UMass grad.   I took a look at actual CS department at the most elite school on your list.  The vast majority when you dig all the way to their personal home page  only list their PhD schools. Almost no one mentions their UG. But some do.  UIUC, Cal, University of Athens, Tufts,Williams, Swarthmore, Weissman Institute, Turkish State School, RISD.  Seems like a pretty good mix.  Doesn’t seem like you should worry.
If you’re talented and tenacious you’ll be fine.

30.<<<scubadive>>>
Take the 200k. It is a nice downpayment or more than enough for grad school.  College is four years.  The rest of your life  is the next 50-70 years.

31.<<<juillet>>>
If you go to UMass and take the $200K, then work for a few years while investing it, you could go to a top MBA program pretty much debt-free. With an MBA salary and no loans to repay, you could go full Wolf of Wall Street.*
I’d take the cash and go to UMass-Amherst, which is an excellent public university.
*exaggerating a little, but you get the picture.

32.<<<austinmshauri>>>
You want to start a company? Which bank is going to give you loans if you’re $160k+ in debt before you even start? There are employers who won’t hire grads with that level of debt and some people will refuse to enter a relationship with someone who owes so much. Take your parents up on their offer.

33.<<<socaldad2002>>>
I actually think it’s cruel of your parents to let you apply to Brown knowing that your family is full pay, they clearly have the money, but now won’t pay for your education at Brown. I don’t get it…
Your only real option is to go to your in-state public and pocket the 200k. Not a bad deal and consolation prize but in very poor taste by your parents. They are suppose to be the mature adults here but reneged on their original “commitment” to you.

34.<<<austinmshauri>>>
We don’t know what OP’s parents said. OP doesn’t seem to be aware that earning $40k/year with a high school diploma is an unreasonable expectation, they didn’t know that Work Study and summer earnings will be nowhere near that amount, and they don’t seem to be hearing that they can’t borrow that much. Maybe the parents did say how much they’d pay.

35.<<<Smileyface1>>>
@austinmshauri   Agree with post 34.
To OP: Go to the state school and be happy.   5 years after you graduate, Come back to this thread and think about what $160,000 of debt coming out of college would have done to you.   (And like what everyone else said, no one is going to loan that much to you and you won’t be able to earn it with work study or summer jobs not even close!)
In short, for what career path you’re interested in, UMass is a perfectly awesome option. And you’ll have a nice little nest egg to begin your career when you graduate.  You’ll be able to afford to make some different young and dumb mistakes!

36.<<<CupCakeMuffins>>>
He has a shot at attending a small, amazing, academically strong, prestigious school with wonderful alumni. His parents can afford to pay for it. However, they rather have him go to a huge state school and invest that money as he pleases. What if he losses that in investment market or in a startup? Money is just money, if it’s meant to be then he’ll earn more or not but a Brown education is priceless.

37.<<<Happytimes2001>>>
OP: I think you need to have a long conversation with your parents. Taking the 200K and then figuring out you wanted a different school could lead to a poor relationship with them in the long run. You have excellent options.
People believe in various things. Some parents want to send their kids to to the best schools they can, other think that’s “toxic” thinking ( for which I have to LOL since it’s along the lines of if you don’t agree with me you are toxic-). It’s all in the perspective.
You will get a great education regardless of where you go. Since you are interested in CS(and neuroscience), I’m not sure Brown warrants the cash. If you wanted to start a company and the choices were Caltech/MIT or UMass, then I’d say VC’s would look more carefully with a Caltech?MIT degree. But I don’t think that is the case here.
One thing I’d add for parents reading this, kids have long memories. If you don’t do the right thing by your kids by being honest about what you can afford and what you will pay for based on your idea of value, it could come back to hit you in the face. Not all 18 year old kids are going to look favorably at you when they realize they are being manipulated in their educational choices. It’s one thing not to have the money. It’s another thing to say I’ll pay for X and not Y after they get accepted to Y. I’m hoping that they articulated they would not pay for Brown and the OP just wasn’t listening.

38.<<<JenniferClint>>>
OP, I recommended UCSD because it has a fantastic program in neuroscience and a very good program in CS. It strikes me as providing a good balance between being affordable and academically excellent.

39.<<<CupCakeMuffins>>>
A great education from a fantastic school is priceless. If it’s meant to be, he can earn much more than that in future but if it’s not, he can loose this money in stocks or startup. Money isn’t everything in life. However, I get where parents are coming from. For a middle class, this is a lot of money and they must’ve sacrificed and saved and worked hard to save it. They may want to keep him near by at state school and buy a condo for him to live.
I don’t blame parents. I blame system for making good colleges so out of reach for middle class applicants. For discriminating between 18 year old applicants on basis of their parents’s income. College should cost less and same for every applicant. Applicants have no choice in this matter, they can’t make anyone pay.

40.<<<Trixy34>>>
Think of this as your first business decision.  Do some research - is a CS degree from Brown more valuable than from UMass?  You should be able to find comparable starting salaries as well as salaries over time.

42.<<<HarryBerry>>>
We went through the same thing with our son.  Although we could afford to pay for his $75k per year school, we felt it was important for him to be willing to pay for a significant portion of the tuition.  So we sat him down and told him we would front the entire cost, but he would have to pay us back half the amount.  It was a stressful time for everyone, but he eventually decided that it was worth it to him to shoulder some of the cost of his top ten school.
My husband and I both know that we will not be collecting anywhere near the amount he agreed to pay back.  We just needed to see the willingness on his part.

43.<<<mom2twogirls>>>
LOL middle class parents aren’t buying their kids a condo!

44.<<<jzducol>>>
I would agree that for pure CS/engineering jobs the school name doesn’t matter much.  The only scenario that I see the Brown option would make sense is that OP wants to get recruited for Wall Street jobs out of college, make a killing and then go to business school.

45.<<<Publisher>>>
The top ten elite MBA programs all cost at least $200,000. Stanford COA for a full time 2 year MBA is about $230,000.
OP: For CS, consider UMass-Amherst. There are some safe blue chip stocks which pay about a 4% dividend. Wisely invested, you could afford any full time MBA program or put a significant down payment on a home.

46.<<<jzducol>>>
Its not like you show Stanford GSB $230K they are going to take you.  Stanford MBA is far more difficult to get into than Brown or UMass.

47.<<<Publisher>>>
OP mentioned MBA school. I realize that Stanford has the lowest acceptance rate among the M-7 & among the top 10 or 12 MBA programs with a 6% admit rate. Many top 10 MBA programs admit 20 % to 22%.
Stanford was mentioned because it is the most expensive full time MBA program for total COA. And about 9 or 10 others exceed $200,000. Used to show how important that lump sum is according to OP"s plans.

48.<<<jzducol>>>
If OP’s career plan involves an MBA then job opportunities in finance and consulting cannot be ruled out.  Its a typical career path for an Ivy STEM major to be recruited for such jobs which pay over $200k/yr for a few years or even for a top MBA.  Such path would be easier with Brown than with UMass.

49.<<<International_Dad>>>
Undergraduate in Umass, MBA in Brown or any Ivy University.No debt.

50.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@Publisher, IMO, an M7 MBA is worth the investment. More so than an Ivy/equivalent undergrad at full-pay (which costs more).
In any case, both Brown and UCSD are top tier schools in CS. UMass a little behind, but IMO, not worth a $200K difference.
BTW, Brown doesn’t offer a “real” MBA.

51.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
UCSD should only be considered for CS by students with direct admission to CS. Entering undeclared means that it will be difficult to get into the CS major.
Of course, whether it makes sense depends on the OP’s parents’ offer of funding for UCSD.  We know that the OP’s parents are being manipulative and playing favorites with college selection by offering different amounts of money ($100k to pay for UMass + $200k extra = $300k, versus $160k to pay for Brown, effectively vetoing Brown due to the shortfall), and the OP has not mentioned what his/her parents financial offer for UCSD is.
Yes, this looks like a case of the parents forcing the student to choose the parents’ preferred college, but at least the parent-forced choice is a good one for the student, unlike some other threads where the parent-forced choice is a poor one (or, even worse, burdens the student with heavy debt as well).

52.<<<iamnotaaron>>>
Hi everyone. Thanks for all of the input thus far, as this decision has been excruciatingly difficult for me. I need to commit by May first, so all additional input would be greatly appreciated.
I really am stuck. For almost all of my life, I’ve been told to go to a good school, but now it seems that the school I want to go to is out of my reach financially, leaving me with UMass Amherst or Northeastern (Why can’t I have my cake and eat it too?). This situation especially hurts because my parents do have the financial capability to pay, but for whatever reason it just isn’t in their interest to do so (I have two younger sisters, so it is understandable). Their financial capability prohibits me from receiving any sort of financial aid, and Brown obviously doesn’t award merit aid.
Please help.

53.<<<PengsPhils>>>
@iamnotaaron
I again really don’t see the downside of UMass here. It’s a great CS program with AI strength and will give you plenty of money for your MBA (and maybe more). It sounds like the state school label is getting in the way here.
I go to Northeastern for CS. I love it and have had amazing experiences and opportunities here. There are truly few schools of any rank I would pick over it. I love Boston and cities generally. If you offered me 200K to go to UMass instead, I would be all over it after maybe 5 minutes of grieving.
I think you’re highly undervaluing that lump sum of money at this point in your life. Invested with a 5% return for 5 years already grows that amount by 50K. With MBA cost being staggered, even after paying for an expensive MBA you can have 50-100K to start off your life, plus any money you can make on internships in undergrad in CS, which isn’t insignificant.
I’m 23. This isn’t coming from some overbearing parent.

54.<<<Publisher>>>
OP wrote : “For almost all of my life, I’ve been told to go to a good school…”. And that is still accurate as UMass-Amherst and UC-SD are good schools for your major.

55.<<<Trixy34>>>
@OP - you’d still be going to a good school!  Look, the college admissions landscape had changed drastically since your parents went to college.  The cost of undergrad is really out of control.  Don’t fault your parents for that.  It’s been disappointing for a lot of us to be smacked with the reality that the cost of a 4 year degree at a lot of “good” schools has exceeded $1/4 million.  That’s a heck of a lot of money and a huge sacrifice. I don’t blame your parents for having a lot of reservations and preferring to see that money go towards giving you a start in business or providing you a cushion.  I’m having the same exact thoughts about my own kid.

56.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
What are your parents’ financial offers for UCSD and Northeastern?
Nevertheless, UMass is still a good school for CS, and $200k extra beyond the cost of college is far more than what most college students will end up with.

57.<<<ucbalumnus>>>

It’s very difficult to see this as a problem. Your folks seem pretty clear. Is it really so horrible that you can go to a fantastic school, graduate without debt and 200k in the bank?
Your parents probably see that it isn’t necessary to spend all that extra money on an “elite” school  for you to thrive and succeed. I’d say you are in a very enviable position.

59.<<<RockySoil>>>
@PengsPhils  great post, spot on.
@iamnotaaron As someone with an undergraduate Ivy degree and an MBA from a top 5 Business school, here is what I would do:

 Take the $200k and go to Umass.

 Congratulate myself for making $200k just for writing an application to Brown:)
 Kick myself for not applying to another Ivy also, so I could have $400k :-)
 In a few years, if you decide to apply for an MBA, write your essay about the fantastic business decision you made when you chose a college at age 18.

Good luck!

60.<<<Hamurtle>>>
I would go with UMass-underrated school and should be higher ranked relative to its current position.
If Northeastern is relatively affordable that’s another good choice with the co-op opportunities.

61.<<<scubadive>>>
In today’s world those schools are considered very good.  Countless parents of bright students can’t or won’t pay $200k + for college.  It really makes no sense.  If you can go buy the same tasting pizza for $10 would you pay $50?  No.  My d who graduated this past year from a state school who is making very good money said to me after her first paycheck (and yes she always worked but now in a different tax bracket) was like damn I see why you complain. Shortly after college most people will never know where you went to school because its not very relevant.  What is relevant is what you do.  Its your demeanor and skills that get you the job and the college degree is a check mark.  Not saying all schools are created equal but its what you make of the opportunity.

62.<<<privatebanker>>>
@Happytimes2001
I’ve seen you mention this a few times. So I will take your comments as referring to my use of the term “toxic elitism”.
To be honest, it has nothing to do with any political viewpoint.
It is the concept of brand name above all common sense.
To some there is a propensity to not consider that a school deemed “lower ranked” doesn’t mean low budget. Or that it may be superior in a field or co-equal.
And there are times that the so called “non elite” option is better suited for one’s success. In that single case or that family. And the indirect denigration of that option leaves me as the reader, sorry for the student and parent. Sorry for how this may leave them feeling about their wonderful choice. Even if it’s not hpysm. Like many people really have that option in real life anyway. Lol.
Especially in some of the engineering and stem fields.
Toxic elitism also assumes that out of the 2.3mm new college students each and every year - we should offer advice by referring back to the 2000 students a year that choose consulting or investment banking as the career lodestone.
It’s toxic to an impressionable young mind or uninitiated parent. And it’s elitist.
Many people come here and make profound statements. Clear and resolute with assurance and authority. That school x is superior to school y.   With no data other than their personal feelings, usnwr or other cherry picked supporting data.
Someone in this thread actually made a declarative statement that if the op wants to start a company that vcs will respect the MIT and Caltech grad over the UMass Amherst CS grad. This poster cannot possibly know. Because as anyone extremely familiar with VC and PE  know, that’s not how it works.
And who was asking about Caltech or MIT. The options for the OP don’t include them.
See toxic elitism also includes the slight of hand tricks. If one can’t make a cogent point based on merits of the question, heck let’s throw in an IB here, a consulting there.  Let’s add some other super elites, unrelated to the question at hand, to prove the point.
That elite trumps all mind set.
This approach hurts many students when they come here.
Only 50k to 60k or so spots exist in the entire collegiate ecosystem for schools with under 27 percent acceptance rates.
Where do the other 2.25mm students have left to go?  Obviously they must suffer the despair of “state school”. As a pejorative.
In this case. Brown is a spectacular university and the much more selective school than UMass Amherst. No disputing that at all.
But it shouldn’t be an automatic default answer.  Because it’s not in all cases, in all majors and for all families.
Schools that strong don’t need constant defense.
What students and parents come here for imho is for balanced and reasoned advice.
And sometimes that means we out aside our own past decisions or our embedded belief systems to consider well reasoned alternatives.
Not elite school or bust.

63.<<<socaldad2002>>>
Make sure that if you do decide to attend UMass that your parents immediately put that 200K money into an account under your name.  My concern is that they will change the “terms of your arrangement” once again after you have committed to UMass (just like they did when you applied to Brown and got in and now they don’t want to pay your way through college).
If I were your parents, I would have said you have two options: a) We will pay for all of your Brown undergrad costs or b) we will pay for all of your UMass undergrad costs and then give you 200K for graduate school, a condo, etc.
This way YOU are making informed choice, not them.
But instead with the current arrangement you really have no option but to go the cheaper route as no rational student is going to go into 160K debt for an undergrad degree, even if it is from Brown.  It’s really a shame…if you were my kid you would be going to Brown in the fall and I would be paying for all of your costs…

64.<<<mom2twogirls>>>
It’s the OPs parents, not a boss at work. There is no “make sure to get the money up front” option to force them into. It’s their money to spend as they choose to spend it. If they want to make sure their kid doesn’t take the money and then transfer the next semester, they can do that. Or if they want to give it to the OP at graduation (like most parents on CC who are giving their kids large sums of money usually do), they can do that. I can’t imagine most parents, outside of the top 1*, give their 18 year old kids hundreds of thousands of dollars.

65.<<<mom2twogirls>>>
OP this is not “a shame”. You are incredibly lucky to have parents who are able to afford for you to attend a great college, especially for your major. As a bonus, they sound like wonderful people who are able to look past prestige and evaluate what is truly important. And not only that, are planning to give you a (beyond the paying for college) huge further gift of a large nest egg to help you get started after you complete your education! That’s amazing. You are very lucky to have parents who see what matters and have worked to make life easier for you, but also in a way so you won’t be a spoiled rich kid who thinks only a name brand has value.
Since you were still looking for advice, mine is to be happy and grateful for the amazing opportunities you have been given. Make the most of them. Allow a little bit of time to grieve for the paths you have to turn from and then fully embrace the wonderful path you are on! Enjoy it, appreciate it, don’t let yourself be bitter or resentful.

66.<<<Riversider>>>
I’ve seen plenty of trust fund babies wasting their inheritances and plenty of penniless youth building their own wealth. I would rather give my children education, opportunities and experiences they crave than money or assets. However, OP’s parents are in no way obliged to give him any money, now or ever. It’s totally their prerogative to spend their money whichever way they want. OP can make requests but he can’t demand anything.

@Cupcakemuffins: College should cost less and same for every applicant.

If all colleges cost the same for everyone then no low income student would ever be able to attend. How is a student from a family whose income is $20k/year supposed to pay the same as a student whose family makes $200k?
OP, why are you against going to UMass and saving the $200k for grad school? The median income in the US is about $60k. Your parents want to gift you more than 3 times that plus a free education at a great school. Meanwhile, on other threads, we’re counseling a homeless student who’s trying to cobble together enough aid for college so they can quit living in cars and tents, and working in exchange for migrant farm housing. Many, many families have no money for school. If they’re lucky, their children will be able to work 40 hours/week and commute to their local state school or community college. Those students have no financial safety net.
If you want the opportunity to start your adult life with a debt of $160k + interest and your parents are willing to cosign for it then nobody’s stopping you. Some employers shy away from students who carry such large debt loads and there are people who won’t date grads who have enormous loans to repay, but you’re certainly welcome to take the debt if that’s what you want. Have you figured out how you’re going to pay it back? How much would the total debt with interest be after 4 years? How will you pay if you don’t get a job right away? Or you get a job but it’s 5-figures and not 6? If you want to go into business the first long term business plan you need to write is your own.

Imagine you are deciding where to have dinner.  The number one rated, Michelin starred restaurant with the famous chef and $100 price tag (Brown) vs. the local Italian restaurant (Umass), where the meals are $20.  You know for a fact that the meals at the Michelin starred place are fantastic.  But in this case, you want lasagna (otherwise known as Computer Science).  The famous place specializes in seafood, but lasagna is on the menu as well.  At the Italian place, the house specialty is lasagna and people come from all around to try it.  Which one would you choose?
Sorry OP, I can imagine that you hoped to get a lot of support on CC for choosing your dream school, and that is not what you are getting.  It is tough to give up a dream, but making a wise choice has its own rewards too.  Congratulations on two fantastic options, you should be very, very proud.

69.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
^ Well, a meal of lasagna anywhere won’t burden you with crushing 6 figure debt.  Picking another place to have lasagna won’t gift you with 6 figures in money ($200K, even at conservative 5% real returns would become $1.4M in 40 years; at 7% real returns, which is what the US stock market has averaged since WWII, that becomes $3M in 40 years).
So examine why you feel the way you do.  Why about Brown made it your dream school?  What aspects?  And can you get those aspects in cheaper ways?  One reason I am annoyed when people say something is “priceless” is because, well, no, actually, very few things are priceless.  The love of someone you care for.  I’m having trouble coming up with anything else, actually, because virtually anything else can be bought with enough money.

Referring to another’s post as toxic violates the rules of CC. In no sense can another person comment on someone else’s post using the word toxic and it not be intended as an attack. The word elitism is certainly fine to use as is arguing whether something is elite or not. What constitutes toxic always refers to poisonous. I believe some find their arguments weak so they use weasel words to strengthen them. It has been reported as such.

A few opinions regarding this thread:

VCs do not give money to recent college graduates (it is very rare) so choosing your college based on that is a bad idea, even if it is MIT.  (But that might get you a job and an equity position at someone else's startup).
Brown's CS department is legendary and frequently under-rated re:Andy vanDam/Toy Story
If your career goal in programming, I agree that it will be your skills and how you develop them over your career that will lead to success and not where your degree is from.  Saving $$ for elite grad school seems like it might be a good idea.  And I have a son at Brown and love it above all other colleges - but I have 3 true geniuses at my tech firm and they all went to 3 different SUNYs.  One of them got accepted to MIT and could not afford it.  The CMU guys are good too, just the SUNY guys are better (but that might be because I am too cheap to hire the top CMU guys!) 

Whatever you decide, you’ll be fine.  My advice is follow your gut and never second-guess or look back, no matter what.

@Happytimes2001
Just as a FYI. Personally, I enjoy your posts and your insight.
At no time or at point is the use of any terms pointed at an individual. And I’ve reread a few times it’s been used.
It’s let say, a colorful euphemism, meant to describe an approach to decision making around many things. Including colleges.
But doesn’t mean everyone else’s ideas aren’t heard.  Let the readers read and let chips fall where they may.
But debating is certainly a violation of the TOS. So Cheers and appreciate your perspective for sure. .

73.<<<Rivet2000>>>
Here’s to the hope that we encourage open discussions without the need to label or claim superiority of thought.
The more ideas - the more better.
Data, first hand experiences, and humor all good…

74.<<<privatebanker>>>
@Rivet2000
Totally agree. And I love the idea of injecting some humor into these discussions.
The  only problem with first hand experiences is they only happen at one institution.
And the use of the terms “elite” and “more prestigious” are ubiquitous here on cc.  These aren’t facts. These are impressions. And generally formed by one’s own world view.
Definition below.
Elitist -
“adjective. (of a person or class of persons) (or college) considered superior by others or by themselves, as in intellect, talent, power, wealth, or position in society.
So when someone says why would anyone  ever go to wake forest for free vs Stanford full pay. Stanford is so much more “elite” and “prestigious”…
Where do you go with that ?
Especially since the fact pattern for each individual case may lead to a different conclusion.
As an example , if the hypothetical above includes info that the family can comfortably pay and they want x career. Stanford all day long!  If the family will need loans, well, hold on a second. That’s all I am saying. Not saying Stanford isn’t considered “better” by many.  Not at all.
Just some food for thought for the OP.  And OP I have no idea what you should decide ultimately.  But your options are all solid and each can be a platform for your own personal success.
Ok. For some humor. Here’s my worst joke.
Horse walks into a bar.  Bartender looks at him and says “Hey Mac, why the long face?”

@privatebanker We’re in basic agreement here, but if faced with the above, I’d ask the poster to list what, in their opinion, makes school X so much more elite ( as in “best in class”). This opens a discussion rather than closing it.
Here’s my latest bad joke:
What did the buffalo say to his son when he left for college? Bison.

76.<<<privatebanker>>>
That joke is great.
But something is in the air. A student who really needs help deciding between CUNY Baruch and Fordham as an example, with monetary questions and no at home support, will get 7 responses total. And 75 views.  Ask about a community college as a parent with zero experience and you’re lucky to get a response.
Ask about Duke vs Princeton.  Or Cambridge vs Yale, both full pay and step back - and watch the floodgates open. Like the decision for that student is nearly as crucial  and vital to their ultimate success. Important sure.
I guess it’s just me. And maybe it’s not as bad is it seems. But its bothersome.

@iamnotaaron
Below are the top three factors I discuss with my wife and two college kids about choosing the right college.  This is just my opinion:

high quality teaching/curriculum in the programs you are interested in
at a reasonable price (public in-state schools)
the school published graduation rate/alumni success

First of all, congratulations! Based on your very fortunate situation, I would choose UMass.  I’m an alumni of UCSD, go tritons! but I wouldn’t recommend UCSD (due to cost) because you are out-of-state.
My suggestions- in your 1st year, stay in the dorms to make connections/friends and for the college experience.  Invest the $160k in an index fund like the S&P 500.  2nd year, have your parents co-sign with you on a mortgage loan to purchase a real estate property near your campus (Amherst median price $340k approx).  Use part of your cash for a down payment approx $68k.  You would live there rent free (parents pay your portion) and rent out the rest of the rooms to college students.  Occupy the same property until graduation.  Hopefully you have positive cash flow starting in the 1st year.  Continue to invest the remaining funds in an index fund or funds (diversify).
Upon graduation, find a full job/employer who will pay for your MBA or graduate school and go to school part time while working.
If everything goes as planned (no guarantees), you will have no student loan debt plus liquid & real estate investments generating cash flow.  Max out your 401(k) at work.
Your investments with compounding interest will generate long-term wealth.  Now you are set to start your own business.
Good luck!

@privatebanker -I thoroughly enjoy your posts, especially in this thread. To whomever reported our post as an attack, lighten up Francis.
@Postmodern -thank you for your post above.
We have the opposite situation of that of the OP.  Our son, who has stellar SATs (1550 plus), 4.0 GPA from an top rated STEM school and what we thought were excellent extracurricular activities, was shut out at all of the prestige CS schools- MIT, Stanford, CMU, Berkeley, as well as Columbia and Cornell.  He was admitted to UCLA and Rutgers Honors College, with Rutgers offering him merit scholarships that would bring the out of pocket total cost to under $10K/year.  We told him that we would support him financially at either place.
Seems some here would say without a second thought- go to UCLA!  Not my son.  We are on the East Coast.  UCLA was not even on his list of schools until I suggested UCLA when we were visiting Cal Tech.  He liked the campus and since he was applying to Berkeley, he figured why not.  So why Rutgers?  First, his parents are both proud Rutgers alums.  Second, while it is not his money, he said that he did not think the additional money for UCLA (Over $225K for 4 years) would be money well spent.  Third, and most important, he dug in and took a close look at the coursework and curriculum of both programs, and  he concluded that Rutgers would be a better fit for him. Fourth, we have heard nothing but rave reviews from students who attended Rutgers Honors College.
I still feel toxic elitism bubbling to the surface in my mind and wanting him to go to the “best school” that accepted him, and that is certainly UCLA by any objective measure.  But is it best for him?  Only he can answer that question.
To the OP- take a close look at the number and variety of courses available.  You also mentioned that you were interested perhaps doing work with a biotech startup down the road.  Check out what Brown and UMass offer in terms of breadth and depth of courses in biotechnology and life sciences.
Finally, while the following ranking only takes into account publications in various CS disciplines, UMass is ranked ahead of Brown.

@Fire227    That’s an awesome set of choices.  Can’t go wrong.
But since Rutgers is the place Bill Belechick looks to for his “go to” school smart players to run the defense. I’d pick The University of New Jersey myself. Lol.
And for anyone who is following sports. The University of Massachusetts at Amherst has come out of nowhere to make it to the national championship game in men’s ice hockey. Just defeating a great University of Denver powerhouse in overtime.
They’ve always had star engineers but now a little bit of sports too!  They say 3000 students are heading to the Frozen Four for Saturday’s  Game. And the entire Mullins center was sold out tonight to watch the  game tonight on the Jumbotron!

“The bad news is you’re playing in the morning.”

Government, donors and college endowments should make sure that college costs are reasonably low so every young American is able to afford the college he is qualified for. If needed to keep recycling same money, there should be easy no interest loans for ALL students, not 100% help for some and 0% help for others. Government or employers can offer part time jobs as part of the plan as well.
