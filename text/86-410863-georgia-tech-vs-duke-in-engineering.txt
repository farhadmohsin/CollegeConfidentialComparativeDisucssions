I am about to apply for Duke in early Decision and I just have to mail the application now.

2.<<<sang54>>>
Unless Duke gives you huge financial aid, I really don't see the reason for attending Duke when GT is very high regarded in engineering world (arguably more regarded than Duke).

3.<<<lvilleslacker>>>
This depends on whether or not you want to actually be an engineer or not. It's the whole "Ivy league-esque" engineering vs mit/caltech/traditional tech school scenario.

4.<<<danas>>>
An engineer could better answer this question.
However, from what I can see the engineering rankings are influenced by the size of the program/number of specialties.
If you have a specific interest that you could pursue one place and not the other, that might be important. On the other hand, it might be important to keep your options open, in which case I would prefer the experience at Duke, Columbia, or Princeton- all lower ranked in engineering that Georgia Tech.
My bias is to go where the smart people are.

5.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
Since you're having qualms over the tuition at Duke, I wouldn't apply for early decision.

Both schools will give you success in the future. What particular engineering branch interests you?

If I were you, I'd apply to Duke and Georgia Tech as a regular admit and then weigh financial aid packages. The decision will become more clear when you have all the cards laid out in front of you.

Duke and Georgia Tech engineering grads will be offered comparable jobs at comparable pay. Engineering employment is highly market driven...new engineering grads are paid a similar starting salary, with possible premiums for better grades. The difference between Duke and GT is not large enough for you to command a larger starting salary, based on school quality alone.

If possible, visit both campuses.

6.<<<FellowCCViewer>>>
Does overall prestige matter to you?

7.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
IMO:

Duke > GT
GT Engineering > Duke Engineering

I think this is the OP's dilemma.

8.<<<bluedog>>>
Dana is correct according to my understanding. I graduated from Duke with a degree in biomedical engineering. Georgia Tech definitely has a higher regarded/higher ranked engineering school than Duke partially because GT offers 12 undergraduate majors, 20 masters degrees, and 16 PhD degrees in 9 different departments, while Duke offers about third of that - only 4 undergrad/PhD majors in 4 departments. So, it's not really a true comparison. Georgia Tech also has over 7,000 undergraduate students in engineering, while Duke has only around 1,200. The sheer volume of research would clearly be larger at Georgia Tech since they have so many more students and faculty so more people would be aware of GT's program.

However, you should really be comparing on a department-by-department basis. For example, if you are interested in biomedical engineering, Duke is widely seen as having one of the best programs in the nation (ranked 2nd in USN&amp;WR to JHU). If, however, you are interested in aerospace, industrial, or nuclear engineering, it is obvious you should choose GT since Duke doesn't even offer these programs. From personal experience, I can tell you that at Duke, the BME, ECE, and ME departments are top notch with great faculty and research opportunities (more than 2/3 of undergrads do research). The Civil Engineering department is kinda seen as a joke compared to the others and undergrads like to joke that students there are just in Trinity (the arts &amp; sciences school at Duke). Although the Civil Engineering does have a few great faculty members - notably Henry Petroski and Earl Dowell. But civil is seen as a notch below. The Princeton Review just ranked Duke's graduate engineering school second in the nation so it is definitely seen as prestigious. If you aren't sure what type of engineering you want to go into, well, then other factors will have to be weighed. I tend to think that a lot more Pratt graduates go into business than at an engineering school like GT, although plenty still stay within engineering. So if you might be interested in business down the line, Duke might be a better choice. Obviously, cost, prestige, campus culture, athletics, campus, liberal arts academics, job opportunities, graduate school prospects, etc. should play a role.

I think the job placement is probably very similar, although I'm sure there is a more diverse array of engineering firms that recruit at GT since there are just so many more students, while particular niche firms continually recruit at Duke as well as the major ones. But, I'd venture to guess it's not <i>significantly</i> different.

I personally wanted to get an engineering degree in the context of a great liberal arts education. I chose Duke over the engineering schools at Penn, Columbia, Michigan, and Illinois. So, I was kind of in your same situation. Cost is also a factor obviously - I was from IL and IL is widely seen as a great engineering school, but I wanted to expand my horizons more and get out of the state. Plus, they didn't even have a biomedical engineering department (14+ departments and no bme?!?), and Duke gave me lots of fin aid money (obviously, still more expensive than in-state IL).

Anyways, good luck with your decision! I'd probably apply RD to both since it seems like you are undecided. Don't go into ED without being 100% sure of your choice.

9.<<<lvilleslacker>>>
Um...
"The Princeton Review just ranked Duke's graduate engineering school second in the nation so it is definitely seen as prestigious."

what? Is this a typo? There's absolutely no way duke's graduate program > mit, caltech, stan, berk, carnegie etc.

10.<<<barrons>>>
PR does not rank schools or depts on a comparative basis.

11.<<<luckybug38>>>
um yes prestige matters to me truthfully
Also I would work better around brighter students

12.<<<luckybug38>>>
I am thinkin bout studyin computer Engineering/ computer science though not really sure. business also interests me. Since I don't have great stat I want to do early decision so I can have better chance of getting accepted

13.<<<bluedog>>>
"what? Is this a typo? There's absolutely no way duke's graduate program > mit, caltech, stan, berk, carnegie etc."
"PR does not rank schools or depts on a comparative basis."

No, it was not a typo or misinformation. See <url>http://www.princetonreview.com/grad/research/articles/find/pdfs/EngineeringPressRelease_Sept_20_2006.pdf</url> and for the rankings see <url>http://www.princetonreview.com/grad/research/articles/find/engineering.asp</url>

According to PR,
1. UC-SB
2. Duke
3. UVA
4. Mich St
5. Johns Hopkins
....

I agree that list is pretty strange now that I look at it. Besides the details about the PR ranking, my point was merely to say that Duke is seen as a fairly prestigious engineering program, and is especially up-and-coming. It is not seen as an annual engineering powerhouse such as MIT, Berkeley, etc. because it doesn't have the same history, does not have nearly as many departments or faculty, etc. Of course, MIT and Cal Tech are seen as more prestigious for the vast majority of engineering programs (BME being the exception).

Anyways, Duke engineering rocks. They treat you like gold, the students are very intelligent and motivated, and they give you free beer on Friday during E-kegs....I loved it. But you can't go wrong with GT either. Definitely very different schools, overall, though, so you gotta go with what you like.

Also, note that there is about a 25% dropout rate for engineering nationwide (I think it's about 20% for Duke). So while you might not think you would want to transfer out in a million years, I know a bunch of people who did, and you might want to consider what school would be better for you if that did occur. On a similar note, like 40% of Duke freshman are pre-med (I'm making up this number), and by the end, the number is much less.

14.<<<icy9ff8>>>
Georgia Tech is a much better school for engineering. Lots of brilliant students at Georgia Tech. As cost is a concern, apply RD to both. Your concern regarding brighter students at one school versus the other are unwarranted.

15.<<<lvilleslacker>>>
i'm sorry, that list is absolutely ridiculous.

the schools i named, mit/calt/stan/berk/carn AREN'T EVEN ON IT.

You're seriously going to point to a ranking in which those schools are not considered the top 20 in the country for engineering?

Yes, it's BME is quite well regarded. but overall, duke engineering is not held in highest regards; it is certainly not number 2 in the country. It's prestige comes from the strength of the student body and the university overall, not because of its engineering strength in particular.

16.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
^ Gee, don't rip on the guy...It's not his list. He was merely pointing out the strength of his school.

He even agreed that the list looked "pretty strange".

17.<<<wobudong>>>
If your stats are good enough for Pratt, you can go to GaTech free if you are a Ga resident. Maintaining the grades to keep the Hope at GaTech, however, is a challenge. If you keep the Hope for four years, the difference in cost will be about 160,000. My son had the same decision. His sister and brother in law were both Duke grads, the latter BME. Son opted for GaTech for ME. GT engineering can be overly demanding academically and GT certainly does not have the social life that Duke offers due to GT's dismal female/male ratio. If you are convinced that you want to be an engineer, however, GT does not take a back seat to anyplace. When my son interviewed for jobs his senior year, not a single company asked his GPA. It seems that surviving GT engineering was more than enough.

18.<<<lvilleslacker>>>
alright, I apologize for coming off as a bit aggressive. But if there's a ranking which is irrefutably flawed - in this case, grossly inaccurate - why even reference it? It's very misleading and should not be used to support your claim.

19.<<<luckybug38>>>
I already submitted Duke supplamant A form with Duke early decision checked... Im not sure if I can change it to regular decision........-_-

20.<<<Windley>>>
How about GT- Presidential Scholarship. The Presidential Scholarship is very competitive and You must apply by Oct 31.

21.<<<luckybug38>>>
yea im applying for dat right now

22.<<<bluedog>>>
"alright, I apologize for coming off as a bit aggressive. But if there's a ranking which is irrefutably flawed - in this case, grossly inaccurate - why even reference it? It's very misleading and should not be used to support your claim."

I am in complete agreement that the Princeton Review's ranking seems inaccurate and certainly not based on prestige. I merely mentioned it in passing with a 20-word sentence in the middle of a paragraph in the middle of a 564-word post (or 3.5% of my single post) because I recall hearing that Duke was ranked second. It's not like it was central theme in my post. To be perfectly honest, I had never actually looked at the complete list until you and another person called me a liar. That's all. You can disregard those 20 words in my original post and read the other 544 words that talk about attractive aspects of Pratt. Both GT and Duke are great - can't go wrong with either really. I think rankings are generally stupid and overemphasized anyways. Cheers!

23.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
^ Haha...did you actually count the words in your post?! And calculated a percentage to boot...LOL

You truly are an engineer...:D

24.<<<bluedog>>>
^^ Yes, yes, I try. :) I didn't actually count the words by hand - I used a MATLAB algorithm that counts words instantly by measuring the spaces between text after taking a screen shot using WinSnap.



Nah, I'm just kidding...I used Word Count in MS Word...Took me like 5 seconds, which I thought wasn't too much time to prove a point. Take it easy!

25.<<<weldon>>>
I just love some of the posts on this string:

the OP: "which school would give me success in the future?" - answer: neither one, how about earning your own success?

danas: "My bias is to go where the smart people are". Yeah, and GT students are of course idiots. How smug.

26.<<<weldon>>>
bluedog, lvilleslacker: if your list indeed to relates to engineering programs, I completely concur that it is very strange- and I went to UVa engineering.

27.<<<danas>>>
Of course GT kids aren't idiots. Just a completely different level of intellectual fire power at a school like Duke.
GT has a different mission. It is a state school with a 70% admissions rate.
I'm sure you could get a fine education at either school.

28.<<<JCCort>>>
Duke >> Georgia Tech

29.<<<danas>>>
Just a reality check on Duke vs. Georgia Tech.
The College Board lists the 25%-75% range on SAT Math as 640-720 at Georgia Tech, and 690-780 at Duke overall. The SAT range for engineering students at Duke may well be, say, 730-800.
The kid who is an engineering student at Duke who couldn't hit 700 on the Math could well be the son of a major donor or a Guard on the basketball team. The engineering student at Georgia Tech who couldn't hit 700 on the Math is the average student.

30.<<<bluedog>>>
College board stats must be old. The SAT range for accepted students for the class of 2011 for Duke engineering was 750-800. Trinity's (the arts &amp; sciences school) range was 690-790. ACT range for Duke engineering was 32-35. Somehow, the Duke engineers even had a higher range on the VERBAL section of the SAT than Trinity (700-770 vs. 680-770). So, overall SAT range for Duke engineering was 1450-1570, meaning 25% of engineers got 1580+ (note: Duke doesn't really care about the writing score and counts it the equivalent of an SATII score).

<url>http://www.admissions.duke.edu/jump/applying/who_2011profile.asp</url>

According to GT's own admission's site, the SAT range for matriculating students was 650-730 for math and 1250-1400 overall for the class of 2011 (still, quite good).

<url>http://www.admiss.gatech.edu/studentstats/</url>

31.<<<danas>>>
bluedog...
A common mistake, you are quoting the figures for accepted students at Duke, not enrolled.
The College Board's figures ARE for the class of 2010, though.

32.<<<luckybug38>>>
you dont add up low 25% of math and verbal to get low 25% of composite math-verbal score. Each person gets differently on each section and admission officer told me Duke's 50% composite range was 1350-1550.

Reality check...SAT scores aren't everything.

Let's say I want to major in chemical engineering, aerospace engineering, industrial engineering, materials science, or polymer/fiber engineering, I can't do that at Duke, because Duke doesn't offer those programs.

34.<<<luckybug38>>>
how about Computer engineering? Which school?

35.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
^ According to USNWR for undergraduate computer engineering:

Computer Engineering:
1 Massachusetts Inst. of Technology

36.<<<luckybug38>>>
so even though Duke's better school in overall, if I am going to major in computer engineering I should go to GT because the rank for computer engineering is very high?

37.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
^ Depends on what you want in a school.

I would have no hesitation choosing Georgia Tech, because it has the prestige in the programs you want, at a cheaper cost.

38.<<<weldon>>>
No, you should go to the one where you prefer to live and work for 4 years, factoring in your finances (i.e., lower costs should equal some amount of compromise), since either one you go to is going to be plenty good enough.

39.<<<luckybug38>>>
what are the advantages of going to each school?

40.<<<JWT86>>>
In terms of faculty quality, Duke is actually quite weak in engineering. It has one of the lowest numbers of National Academy of Engineering members of the top 50 engineering schools. Even other smaller engineering programs still have a relatively higher NAE concentration.

Some relative comparisons: (just a spot check, not all major programs listed)

MIT 108
Stanford 87
Berkeley 73
UTexas 49

Duke 3

41.<<<lvilleslacker>>>
that's a pretty startling figure, though of course there's more to it than that.

duke's program is up and coming. it's nothing special right now and again i would say that at this point, the question is, do you want to actually BE an engineer or not? GT wins in this regard; Duke wins in keeping doors open.

42.<<<jaso9n2>>>
Let's be honest. You're probably not getting into Duke anyway, and it's an s-load of money for mostly a name. GATech sucks (bad part of town, too many guys, kinda boring, smells weird), but they do have a good Engineering program. Plus, there's the HOPE scholarship, in-state tuition, and more diversity. Go to GATech.

43.<<<Sam Lee>>>
GATech is in bad part of town? I just went to Atlanta and I thought midtown is one of the hottest and most trendy areas in Atlanta right now. Granted, most of GA Tech is on the other side of the freeway and maybe it's very different there?

44.<<<luckybug38>>>
why would you say i prob won't get in if you don't know me? that was kinda rude just saying dat.

45.<<<jaso9n2>>>
Midtown is nice...during the day and in certain parts. Other parts are pretty seedy and run down. You don't see that because you can't tell where GA Tech ends and where Midtown begins.

luckybug: I wasn't trying to be rude, just honest. Duke is very selective, and they try to engender excitement about applying, then reject people to up their ranking. I wouldn't even waste my time applying there, especially since the field you want to go into isn't Duke's specialty. Down here you have the HOPE scholarship and a school with a better engineering program. It really should be a no-brainer.

46.<<<luckybug38>>>
so who r those who get in?

2200 in SAT
SAT subject tests
Math II 800
Korean 800
Chemistry 780
took every AP courses I could possibly take in high school with honors.
High GPA top 10%
Varsity Soccer
numerous clubs n volunteer includin tutoring.
do i have chance?

47.<<<jaso9n2>>>
Sure, you have a chance. A really good chance, in fact. But considering what field you want to enter, I don't think it's wise for you to go to Duke just because of the name recognition.
