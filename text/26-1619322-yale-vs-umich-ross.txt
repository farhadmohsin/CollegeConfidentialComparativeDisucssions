Hey everyone i'm doing this post for my friend because he doesn't have an account. He was accepted at Yale and Michigan in the early decision/action period and is having a hard time deciding due to financial reasons. He will have to pay full price for Yale(60k) and in-state for Michigan(~15k, he received some scholarship dont know the name) which if attends Yale will leave him with a extremely large student loan. He will most likely do something business related so it makes the decision ever harden considering how good Michigan's business school is. So, basically he wants to know where to go and if you could provide your reasoning behind it that would be extremely helpful.

2.<<<Pat1120>>>
If he is pre-admitted to the business school, go with Michigan.

3.<<<maizeandblue21>>>
Pre-admit to Ross is on par with Ivy schools. I'd probably go Yale but if he wants the big state school environment and needs the money it wouldn't be so egregious to pick Ross. Yale econ is a slightly higher target for iBanks and Consulting firms but if he's smart enough to get into Yale undergrad I'm sure he'd be just fine getting a great job out of Ross too. The bschool here certainly won't limit anyone's options.

4.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"Nobody gunning for Yale goes to Michigan."

If you can't afford Yale, the OP isn't getting any money from them, then Michigan is a very viable alternative. Yale is not worth 180K more than Michigan/Ross PERIOD.

5.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"The propaganda here is on another level. Wow."

So is the arrogance.

6.<<<ForeverAlone>>>
Yale will open more doors. There are firms that don't even consider anything less than the top Ivys

The What if? Factor is bigger when choosing not to go to yale. Debt can typically be repaid(considering if youre qualified to go to Yale and interested in business) but you can't really make up an experience like a top Ivy. Then again Do you really think successful state school alumni like Stephen Ross, Youtube, Groupon founders are kept awake at night for not going to HYPMS? No, they are laughing their way to the bank

7.<<<Vladenschlutte>>>
[quote]The propaganda here is on another level. Wow.[/quote]

What propaganda? It might be a little easier to get into banking from Yale Econ than Ross, but it's still plenty possible from Ross and the savings in that over Yale is 180K. That's huge. Everyone's gotta make their own value decisions here, but it's certainly not without trade-off to pick Yale over Ross.

8.<<<Pat1120>>>
It's one thing if his family could afford to pay for Yale. If he's going to be stuck with 150k in loans, that will probably compound to closer to 200k-250k by the time it is repaid. You may make a great salary in I-banking, but living in New York isn't cheap.

If I'm working 100 hour weeks, and get paid a 30-60k bonus, the last thing I'd want to do with that bonus is to repay student debt. Especially when 90% of the firms that target Yale are also targeting Ross.

If you're cut out for I-banking, whether you go to Ross or Yale, you'll likely get a similar job. It's about what YOU do at the school, not the school itself. I'd say the same of nearly any target.

And if he doesn't want to do high end finance or consulting? Then going to Yale would be pretty much be a waste of 150k+...

9.<<<Alexandre>>>
Wow. Really? Yale will cost $180,000 and people think this is an obvious decision? That is a lot of money. The OP clearly stated that his friend will have to take a significant student loan, so money is a concern. This is not a straightforward decision. Yes, Yale (which is on par with Harvard, MIT, Princeton and Stanford) is a better overall university than Michigan, but no way is it $180k better if much of that money will manifest itself in the form of debt. The alternative in this case is Michigan (which is on par with Cornell, Northwestern, Penn and UVa) not some second rate university. Choosing Yale would not be unwise, but it is not obvious either. This is a very personal decision, and there is no right or wrong. It really depends on one's priorities. Financially, Michigan is the more rational choice. Going to Yale will most likely not make up for the $180k spent on tuition rather than being invested soundly from day 1. But there is something to be say about having gone to Yale for college. It is indeed a special experience.

10.<<<CHD2013>>>
Good points bluebound. There's clearly a lot to consider with strong arguments on both sides. Posters taking extreme positions should back them up in a better way than we've seen above. For example:

Alexandre - you say "but no way is it $180k better" and then later in you post say going to Yale would not be unwise and that it is a persona decision. After starting by admitting it is not a straightforward decision you contradict yourself with strong statements and then a balanced evaluation of the other side of the argument.

rjkofnovi makes stronger statements with no balance. Frankly, the statement is flat out wrong. You've made the point that the decision is completely clear. I can assure you that many people that went to Yale and had career earnings of many millions of dollars realize they may not have had that type of opportunity if they had gone to Michigan. For example, if you look at the educational background of senior partners at many private equity shops you'll see a very limited number of schools represented. Coming from UM would significantly reduce your job prospects at these firms where the average senior employee an make north of $5 million per year. In that context, $180k in student loans would b e considered a very wise investment.

11.<<<Alexandre>>>
"Nobody gunning for Yale goes to Michigan."

Nobody? So certain are we? 25% of Michigan's incoming class had a perfect 4.0 unweighed GPA, was ranked in the top 5% of their high school class and most of those students scored 1500+/33+ on the SAT/ACT, and yet not one of those 1,500 incoming Freshmen was "gunning" for Yale? That's a remarkably astute observation. I suppose those gunning for Yale do not apply to any target schools...either that or Yale must really suck for those 1,500 freshmen not to have even considered applying.

For a sense of perspective, Yale is generally rated anywhere from 1-5 while Michigan is generally rated anywhere from 6-20. Woefully flawed ranking methodologies and unethical data reporting practices may cloud the issue and severely distort some rankings, but most people involved in graduate school admissions or corporate recruiting aren't fooled.

12.<<<Pat1120>>>
"Lifetime earnings of avg Yale grad isn't $180k more than avg Michigan grad? I find that very hard to believe. Cite your source. Furthermore, it's quite hard to quantify the connections made witlh the elite that you attend Yale with."

180k over a career is a LOT less than 180k (plus interest....?) now. Inflation...? Plus, if you're making 500k+, you value money a lot less than you do when you're right out of college. The utility of money now is much higher than later.

More importantly, WHO CARES ABOUT THE AVERAGE? The average Michigan grad is slightly less intelligent, and much less interested in prestige and income. If your friend got into Yale, he is likely in the top 20% of students at Mich. The kids in Ross who are 'I-banking' material WILL LAND GREAT JOBS. Yale will NOT just give you a job at Blackstone or Lazard.

And please. Don't act like Ross grads aren't well represented in every desirable business industry. I've networked with numerous Ross grads at top HFs and PEs. I'm sure Yale's network is also exceptional, but don't act like Ross is a 2nd tier b-school.

The persistent desire to bump Michigan into elite company is insufferable. As a Michigan bound high school senior I don't wish to be associated with people like you. Michigan is a respectably ranked, fantastic value for residents of Michigan. It's engineering and graduate programs are some of the best in the world. Please stop trying to make the undergraduate college something it's not.

*****

You should figure out why you have such disregard for the institution you claim you will attend next year.

I do not think it is the people who are happy with UM that are insufferable in this situation.

People who do the research, run the numbers and know what opens doors in this world understand the Michigan pull.

Maybe someday you will, too. Until then, you may want to work on your approach, because if you are remotely genuine, you have issues that you should probably handle.

Michigan is ranked #28 by USN &amp; WR, 30 by Forbes. Alex - do you really believe that if it weren't for "unethical data reporting practices" of 10 higher ranked schools, UM would be 6-20?

18.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
USNWR rankings favor private schools.

19.<<<CHD2013>>>
UM is ranked 2nd (3 way tie) bu US News for undergrad b schools. However:

a) "These undergrad business programs were ranked solely on a peer assessment survey conducted in spring 2013"

b) Schools like Yale and many of the other top 30 schools in the country weren't included because they don't have undergrad business schools.

If the OP had indicated that the applicant really wanted to study business in undergrad then UM would have been the logical choice (since Yale doesn't offer that curriculum).

22.<<<CHD2013>>>
rjk - you seem to have an agenda and just ignore all logic. For example, you include the following quote to prove the applicant wants to study business:

"..........He will most likely do something business related so it makes the decision ever harden considering how good Michigan's business school is........"

There's a big difference between wanting to do something business related and wanting to studying business. I think the quote below shows that the presence of a b-school, or the lack thereof, is not the dominant factor in the decision:

"and is having a hard time deciding due to financial reasons"

Anyway, I have no dog in this fight. I got surprised and interested after browsing and seeing some comments by senior members that were so easily refuted. But that's enough for me, I'm outta here.

23.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"I got surprised and interested after browsing and seeing some comments by senior members that were so easily refuted."

You mean like suggesting it might be worth it for an 18 year old to go into huge debt for an undergraduate education at a school that is modestly better than his instate option? You sure "refuted" that one well. It doesn't matter anyway, since you are "outa here."

"As far as Michigan being rated 6-20, I can't seem to find any undergraduate rankings that put it in that range. On USNWR it's #28, Forbes ranks it #30, Business Insider rates it #20.

Actually,that is not accurate. If anything, most undergraduate rankings have Michigan ranked among the top 20, including Forbes. Forbes ranks Michigan #30 overall, but that includes LACs. Among research universities (and I was only talking about research universities when I said Michigan would be rated among the top 20), Michigan is actually #20 according to Forbes, not that I think highly of the publication. As you pointed out, Business Insider, which you also mentioned, also rates Michigan #20. Washington Monthly ranks Michigan #12. Jack Gourman ranks Michigan among the top 5 undergraduate institutions in the US. In fact, the USNWR is the only ranking that I know of that ranks Michigan out of the top 20. The only constant between all those rankings is that none of them is reliable.

The USNWR has a methodology designed with private universities in mind. For example:

1. The USNWR does not include state appropriations and their impact on financial aid in their Financial Resources Ranking. Michigan's financial standing is clearly among the top 15 in the US, arguably among the top 10. Its endowment of $8.4 billion is 6th largest in the land. When you factor in the $300 million in state appropriations, it is like adding $6 billion to the endowment. Other than HYPS, I cannot think of any university that has more financial resources than Michigan. Even on a per student basis, Michigan would be among the top 15 (with no real difference separating #10 from #15), and that would not take economies of scale and efficiencies into account.

2. Alumni donation rates. Public universities cannot solicit their alumni as aggressively as private universities do. Until recently, public universities did not even approach alums for donations while elite private universities have done so for ell over 100 years. Given the difference in philosophy and practice, it is not possible to compare public and private universities with each other. That being said, in recent years, Michigan has been blessed with generous donations from alums. In fact, if one were to look at donation size per donor, or even total donations per alum, Michigan would probably be among the top 10 or top 20. But given the differences in approach to soliciting donations...and reporting them, this criterion should not be part of any ranking that includes private and public universities.

3. Faculty resources rank is one of the most questionable. Private universities take such liberties in reporting class sizes and student to faculty ratios that it is impossible to trust this segment of the ranking. Most private universities pretend that graduate students do not exist and do not include graduate students in their calculations. Having student to faculty ratios in the 6:1 - 8:1 range may seem impressive, but if those universities included graduate students as do public universities, their ratios would increase to 11:1 or 12:1. Still excellent, but no longer impressive.

There is no doubt that if the USNWR improved its methodology and audited data for accuracy and consistency, public universities like Cal, Michigan and UVa would all be ranked among the top 20.

"The New York Times has it out of the Top 100 Global Universities according to corporate recruiting."

The link you provided was not based on any survey conducted by the New York Times, it merely posted it. The link you provided above is based on a survey conducted by a French HR consulting firm, and the vast majority of the firms surveyed were European, with a few European-based firms in South America and North America included. The first year the survey was released, MSU was ranked in the top 50 while Michigan was not ranked in the top 100. The second year saw MSU drop out of the top 80 and Michigan jump in the top 100. It is fairly evident that many of those Europeans confused the two and rated MSU under the assumption it was Michigan. Eliminate confusion from the survey and Michigan would be ranked among the top 15 US universities. Not knowing the exact name of the University is not their fault. It is confusing to many Europeans that two universities can have the name "Michigan". That is not to say that Michigan does not have a very strong reputation in Europe. The Times and the QS rankings, both released by British institutions, rank Michigan among the top 15 US universities. According to the Times, Michigan's reputation ranking is #12 in the World and #9 in the US. Any US-based corporate recruiters' ranking would definitely have Michigan among the top 15, if not among the top 10, depending on the industry.

Ironically, the WSJ did conduct a survey on employer sentiment, but I am not sure you will like it. Michigan was ranked #6 according to that survey.

<url>http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748704554104575435563989873060?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;amp;url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704554104575435563989873060.html</url>

"Michigan's graduate programs are top 10, its professional programs are top 15, and its undergrad is top 30. I would say that is a fair assessment of The University of Michigan as an overall institution."

Not entirely fair. According to all graduate rankings, Michigan would actually be among the top 5 for graduate programs (behind only Cal, Harvard, Stanford and Princeton) and among the top 7 or 8 for professional programs.

For the reasons listed above, there is no undergraduate ranking that I respect, least of all the USNWR. I think Gerhard Casper (Yale-educated scholar, once dean of Chicago Law school and president of Stanford University from 1992-2000 said it best in his letter to the Editor if the USNWR:

"...I am extremely skeptical that the quality of a university - any more than the quality of a magazine - can be measured statistically. However, even if it can, the producers of the U.S. News rankings remain far from discovering the method. Let me offer as prima facie evidence two great public universities: the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and the University of California-Berkeley. These clearly are among the very best universities in America - one could make a strong argument for either in the top half-dozen. Yet, in the last three years, the U.S. News formula has assigned them ranks that lead many readers to infer that they are second rate: Michigan 21-24-24, and Berkeley 23-26-27."

<url>http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/president/speeches/961206gcfallow.html</url>

Dr. Casper's opinion is fairly standard among the educated elites. Any ranking that has Cal and Michigan ranked out of the top 20 is highly suspicious, not just in academe, but also in most corporate circles.

29.<<<Trinity7>>>
Since cash flow is a sticking point, and if OP's friend is intrinsically interested in pursuing business management, Ross is a great choice.
Although Yale, over long term (30 years) horizon provides a slightly better return on investment. $954,300 (Yale) versus $901,400 (Michigan). [<url>http://www.payscale.com/college-education-value-2013</url>, compare 30 year net ROI column],
IMO, high levels of debt to attend Yale is not worth the mental anguish. Save the money, work a few years &amp; attend Yale (or Stanford, Michigan, ....) for MBA. Get the best of both worlds!

30.<<<Vladenschlutte>>>
I don't understand that source Trinity. Is it saying that the average student from Michigan is only going to make 900K over 30 years?

31.<<<Trinity7>>>
^^ 30-Year Net ROI: The Earnings Differential is the difference between the 30 Year Median Pay for a 2012 Bachelor's Graduate and the Weighted 34-36 Year Median Pay for a 2012 High School Graduate. The cost utilized is the Weighted Total Cost for a Graduate of 2012
<url>http://www.payscale.com/data-packages/college-roi-2013/methodology</url>

The ROI values that you see are not the total earnings of a college graduate, but rather the current value of future earnings premium over that of a high school graduate (net present value). It is also assuming that the future earnings of college graduates will be similar to the past 30 years earnings. Keep in mind that a college student forgoes earnings during the time S/he is in college (opportunity cost), and is subtracted from the overall earnings.

IMO, the only drawback is that the Payscale study does not normalize wage premiums enjoyed by college graduates who are employed in places with high cost of living, which translates into higher wages, and skews the results in favor of schools located in the vicinity of such places. When surveys are done on a large scale (like Payscale), it may be difficult to make such cost of living adjustments in calculating the net ROI since people move around during their career, and onerous to collect such data.

It is ironical while CC readers argue about college rankings, the employers have a different outlook on hiring.

Employers value applied skills and knowledge in the field more than where a candidate went to school

33.<<<wayneandgarth>>>
Yes, but here are a couple items I pulled out:

"Busteed points out that many top companies still hire from a narrow set of institutions. But the survey points to a greater emphasis on hiring people with specific skills."

"School rankings have been found to matter when it comes to pay, an effect which rises over time. Graduates of elite private schools in particular get paid more according to a report from the Century Foundation (pdf)."

The survey doesn't concentrate on positions for new college graduates but all position hires. The results will be different if the question focused on on new college grads and would be vastly different if it focused on some specific orgs such as bulge bracket banks, high end consulting and top end techs (Google, Facebook, etc.)

So it somewhat depends on where your aspirations are for a 1st "real job". Certainly, positions demanding experience will put less focus on the school. True in all industries.

35.<<<Decorative22>>>
What, exactly, is the goal of repeated UM bashing on multiple threads?

Seriously.

Is there a point? It distracts. No one is going to post their real names and identifying information to prove they are telling the truth about verifiable information on schools.


This is insane. If you don't like UM? Don't attend.

If you don't like UM? Probably a good idea not to hang out on threads about it.

36.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
ennisthemenace and bluebound18 are probably the same poster. Just in the past week, it was already proven that one poster was using different three different pseudonyms to bash on Michigan. Those names have all been banned.

37.<<<Alexandre>>>
"Alexandre, can you prove that USNWR doesn't take into account Endowment Per Capita when calculating the Financial Resources category or is this just a mere conjecture on your part? No one seems to know how the Financial Resources section is calculated since USNWR doesn't reveal that."

It is not whether or not the USNWR takes endowment and endowment per capita into account when calculating the Financial Resurces category, it is whether or not it uses other criteria too heavily, and if so, why? The main inputs that should go into the Financial Resources ranking are endowment (accounting somehow for state appropriations in the case of public universities), endowment per capital and perhaps operating costs. If that's that case, Michigan would be ranked among the top 15, not #40.

"At any rate, all the Ivies, Chicago, Caltech, Duke, Hopkins, Stanford, MIT, UCLA, and Berkeley are all more internationally renowned than UMich. There is simply no denying this."

That is grossly inaccurate. I am not going to bash other universities, but Michigan is widely regarded as one of the top 15 US universities in international circles. Internationally, in Europe, only HYPSM, Cal and Columbia have stronger reputations. In Asia, I would add Cornell and UCLA to that short list. Other Ivies, Chicago, Duke, Hopkins etc...have equally good, but not stronger, reputations among the educated classes. That is why the corporate ranking you seem to regard so highly is clearly confusing MSU for Michigan. No offense against MSU, it is a good university, but it would not be ranked nearly as high if it were not for it being confused for Michigan. Your assumption that the confusion would not life Michigan from whatever ranking it had among US universities to the top 15 US universities assumes that there is a significant difference between Michigan's ranking (say it was #50 among US universities) and #15. There probably isn't. Beyond Harvard, Stanford and a couple other US universities, the difference between the remaining top universities would be present, but not significant. Like I said, without the confusion, any accurate rating of Michigan by corporate entities, either US or international, would most likely have it among the top 15.

38.<<<Trinity7>>>
This discussion is definitely not about ranking of Michigan. OP had a specific question; how to resolve the conflict between incurring a loan burden of $180 K to attend Yale versus attending Ross, Michigan's UG business school, at  the cost and not incur any loans.

Furthermore OP stated that his/her friend is interested in pursuing business as a career. The following questions are in order.

1. Which of the two has better business curriculum, business faculty, and grooms its students for business?
Curriculum: Ross, in addition to requiring academic breadth (liberal arts), provides the depth needed in various areas of business.
<url>http://www2.bus.umich.edu/MyiMpact/academics/core/BBA#2014</url>

Yale, on the other hand, offers just one course in accounting, ACCT 170a, Financial accounting versus numerous courses offered by Michigan.
In marketing, or business strategy, Yale's curriculum does not list any courses in these areas. Of course, one may argue that game theory is strategy, but not quite, simply because business eco system is far more complex; game theory is one important aspect of numerous business strategy considerations.
<url>http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/</url>

Michigan is well known in the areas of marketing management and strategy among people in the know. Yale, does have a great economics program, and offers a plethora of courses in finance, game theory etc.
<url>http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/economics/#coursestext</url>

Faculty/Thought leadership: Ross's business faculty has produced a prodigious volume of work in advancing the concepts of economics, finance, operations research, etc, in ares that are applicable to many strategic &amp; operational aspects of business.
<url>http://www.bus.umich.edu/FacultyResearch/</url>

Yale's faculty is well known for fundamental research &amp; innovating in many areas.
<url>http://innovators.yale.edu/faculty.asp</url>
In keeping with Yale's tradition based on liberating or freeing the mind to its fullest potential. The essence of such an education is not what you study but the result  gaining the ability to think critically and independently and to write, reason, and communicate clearly  the foundation for all professions, Yale does have an edge over Ross in the area of liberal arts education. However, when it comes to business specific SKILLS, Ross provides the skills needed by the business. This is reflected by the sentiment of business leaders when they recruit at campuses look for specific skills &amp; subject area mastery, and not where the student attended college.
<url>http://www.gallup.com/poll/167546/business-leaders-say-knowledge-trumps-college-pedigree.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=Economy</url> - Well-Being (link repeated for convenience)

2. What about business related career resources?
Michigan devotes career resources exclusively for its business students, and it differentiates its business career resources from engineering (ECRC) and liberal arts. This writer is not aware if Yale has a similar career focus wherein its career resources are dedicated in addressing the needs of students who want to get into business related careers (such as operations management, or marketing etc).. Roughly 43% of Ross students find full time employment in finance &amp;15 % in marketing. Yale does not provide this information, but can be inferred to be a smaller percentage of its graduates that go into finance or marketing.
<url>http://www.bus.umich.edu/admissions/UndergraduatePrograms/PDF/BBA_Viewbook_lo.pdf</url>

3. What about starting salary, will I be able to recoup the cost of education?
Ross' graduates garner a $15K premium over Yale's graduates. The median salary of Ross graduates in 2012 was $65K (+ with a median bonus of $7.500), while the median salary for Yale graduates for year 2013 was round $50K.
<url>http://www.bus.umich.edu/Admissions/UndergraduatePrograms/careers.htm</url>

<url>http://ucs.yalecollege.yale.edu/sites/default/files/Yale_College_First_Destination_Report_Class_2013.pdf</url> (Page 5, Starting Salary range)

For a student who is contemplating the pursuit of only an undergraduate degree either from Yale or Ross, in general, ROI for Ross is expected to be higher.

In summary, for OP's friend, considering specific financial constraints, Michigan Ross is a better option than Yale. However, if OP's friend is open to other career paths, can convincingly appeal his/her financial package offered by Yale, and if Yale ups its offer to make it financially viable, s/he will have to review the decision.

Sorry bluebound18 but the frequency and closeness of your posts with ennisthemenace is suspicious to me.

41.<<<Alexandre>>>
"Nobody is ranking their 500-700 student lectures top 15 in the world. Just yesterday a few posters said "the undergraduate lectures [electives] are a complete waste of time."

Intro-level lectures at Michigan seldom exceed 500 students. 600 or 700 lectures are virtually unheard of. And those large, intro-level lectures are quite common at all large research universities. Do you think those classes that enroll 400 or 500 students at Michigan will magically enroll only 70 or 80 students at Columbia or Harvard? Intro level lectures at Columbia and Harvard often enroll 200 students, some enroll as many as 300 or more students. Once you have more than 100 students, you can no longer boast of having a small classes. At that point, you will invariably move to a lecture-based format. Class size and faculty attention are not going to be the forte of any research university. If one wishes to have intimate, discussed based classes and the full attention of the faculty, LACs are the only way to go.

That being said, large lectures (anything over 100 students qualifies as large) are only common Freshman year. Typically, intermediate and advanced classes that Sophomores and upperclassmen take usually enroll fewer than 30 students (often fewer than 20), except in very popular majors such as Econ, Political Science and Psychology, where such classes will still enroll 50-150 students, but again, that is going to be the case at most elite research universities. Bottom line, one does not go to a research university if one wants an intimate classroom experience and the devotion of the faculty. Again if those are priorities, LACs are the only way to go.

"You guys are so deluded it's incredible."

Classy as always.

"The lifetime (business) connections you make attending Yale are easily worth $100,000."

First of all, in this case, the difference is not $100,000, it is $180,000. Secondly, if you want to talk about lifetime, saving $180,000 over four years of college is not exactly $100,000 over a lifetime is it? In fact, it will likely amount to well over a million dollars over a lifetime. I am not sure any connection is worth that much. In fact, most would agree that networking is vastly overstated. Just because you know many successful individuals will not make you successful. As you will one day painfully find out, connections will not stick their necks out, or go out of their way, to help you. Most people save their precious few connections for themselves and their children/family. The are not about to blow a possible favor on some college acquaintance. As Trinity has demonstrated via data published by Ross and Yale respectively, Ross grads outearn Yale graduates significantly. It is safe to say that employment opportunities for Ross grads are fairly good, even compared to those of Yale grads.

"The abundance and quality of job offers that are avail to you as a Yale student simply don't exist in Ann Arbor, period."

Really? And are those extremely rare job offers that "do not exist in Ann Arbor" open to all Yale grads or only a select and lucky few? Care to name some of those firms that only recruit at Yale and not at Michigan? I have a list of all universities that recruit at Michigan (Ross and the CoE), but I am curious which firms recruit exclusively at Yale...and how many Yalies they actually hire.

"Yale undergrad is ranked 25 spots higher than Michigan's undergrad for a very good reason."

In academic circles, Yale undergrad is only considered 5-10 spots better than Michigan undergrad. A ranking must truly manipulate data to stretch it to 25 spots. And even if the ranking you are alluding to were accurate, in a country with thousands of universities, 25 spots is hardly significant.

"I'd be happy to post my acceptance letter from December."

Congratulations! But I am confused about something. Clearly, you believe you can do much better than Michigan. If Michigan does not match your standards, and clearly money is no factor in your case, why waste your money there? Why not attend a university worthy of your talents? I think you will be miserable at Michigan.

Sorry Alexandre, this is no where near the truth. Very, very false. False on large lectures being mostly just freshman outside of major departments, false on major classes in large departments being 50-150 students (they're often much bigger than that), false on even electives in smaller departments often being under 20 students. Just all false.

On a completely unrelated note, below is an interesting comparative snapshot:

MURDERS (per 100,000)
Ann Arbor 1
New Haven 13

FORCIBLE RAPES (per 100,000)
Ann Arbor 35
New Haven 42

ROBBERIES (per 100,000)
Ann Arbor 43
New Haven 650

ASSAULTS (per 100,000)
Ann Arbor 123
New Haven 735

OVERALL CRIME RATE (higher means more crime, US average is 301)
Ann Arbor 172
New Haven 660

I understand that New Haven now has a problem with gang-related violence.

I am not employed, nor am I a "middle manager". I was never good at reporting into others. I am a business owner. My practice is seasonal, with a very busy September-December period, and a not-so-busy January-May period. I do not work at all June-August. That leaves plenty of time for frivolous activities such as this. Yes, I lead a very difficult life! Oh the struggles of the independently wealthy. ;)

Alexandre is being modest bluebound18. Modesty is a fine quality that perhaps one day, as you mature, you'll be able to call upon when dealing with others.

Couldn't help myself on this one - I was researching Michigan's Research Community option for my son and stumbled on this thread. I recruit for IBanking at Ross and graduated with UM BBA in the 1980's. There is no huge IB recruting advantage Yale over Ross, in fact, certain firms favor Ross kids for being better versed in team type activities. However, certain IB firms are very close to Yale given senior mgmt ties. You will find that Yale places really well in sales and trading IB jobs given those ties. But for a straight-up Analyst position in Corp Fin for IBanking, there are probably slightly more Ross hires than Yale hires street-wide each year. The best mgmt consulting gigs, however, go to Yale. And on the east coast, you can't deny the overall Yale connection as being a difference maker. So I would recommend you sole-search a bit ... are you 100% sure you are East-bound after graduation and then plan to stay to maximize that Yale connection? If not, then Ross may be a better choice given its larger global alumni network and strong national recognition of the Ross BBA (and no debt!). Living in NYC with $180k in debt would be no fun ... but then again, working 100 hrs a week doesn't give time for much fun anyway. The IB analyst job is all about getting on a steep learning curve and building skills ... where you studied undergrad won't be that important 2-3 years down that road anyway. However, if you are 100% certain that the East Coast thing is what you "want for a lifetime" then Yale might be worth the extra money for that old-world, Ivy connection that can open some unique doors in NYC. The Michigan connection is strong on the east coast, but Yale has enjoyed a generational head-start that has higher-powered connectivity.
