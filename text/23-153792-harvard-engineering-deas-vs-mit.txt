Hello

2.<<<pebbles>>>
Cause they're businessmen, not engineers...?

Do you want to be rich or do you want to build stuff? They don't necessarily come hand-in-hand. You could be the most talented engineer in the world and work behind the scenes your whole life making businessmen rich.

And last I heard, the revenue from MIT-alumni-based companies is equivalent to that of a small country. Ahh, found it:

<url>http://www.ssti.org/Digest/1997/digest54.htm</url>
[quote]Graduates of MIT have founded some 4,000 currently active companies, according to the report. Worldwide, these companies account for annual revenues of almost $232 billion. Compared with foreign countries, MIT-related companies would rank 24th largest in the world -- just behind South Africa and ahead of Thailand.[/quote]


Have fun at Harvard :)

Yeah
But he chose to attend Harvard Engineering not MIT engineering program

5.<<<pebbles>>>
Yeah.
But then he left...


(two can play at this game.)

6.<<<tetrahedr0n>>>
Was Gates getting an engineering degree? I thought it was something else...

7.<<<mootmom>>>
According to <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_gates" rel="nofollow">his entry in Wikipedia</a>, Gates was studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science (not specifically engineering) at Harvard when he dropped out.

8.<<<mdx49>>>
Computer Science program at Harvard is in the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) program . Bill Gates was a student at the Devision of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard.

MIT computer science program is in the School of Enginnering, department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)

9.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Well, I think there's a question here -- did all of those people <i>choose</i> Ivy engineering programs, or did they just not get into MIT? Many people, as you may be aware, don't have a choice.

I'm always very suspicious of "alum list" types of evidence, because it's heavily anecdotal and isn't easily turned into some type of statistic. Sure, those particular Harvard engineering alums are very successful, but what about the rest of them? Is the <i>average</i> MIT engineer more or less successful than the average Harvard engineer? Those sorts of questions are the most important for the average person (obviously), but they're not well-answered by laundry lists of program alumni.

Both programs should be approximately equally good if you're planning to major in engineering as a conduit to other things (ie investment banking), but if you want to be a practicing engineer and build stuff, MIT engineering is the thing to do, hands down.

10.<<<sagar_indurkhya>>>
Actually, what made Gates rich was not what he learned at Harvard. Instead, he decided to write an operating system and a programming language(BASIC) that was user friendly, unlike the IBM OS2, which was light years ahead of DOS and Windows, yet remained extremely user-unfriendly. He was a business man, not a genius engineer. He does have a very good vision however, and knows how to play his cards, while at the same time, knowing enough technical stuff that he's not just some snobby chairman, but actually sit down with low level developers.

11.<<<sakky>>>
Reminds me of the infamous quote said by former MIT undergrad Dean Margaret MacVicar: ""Too many MIT graduates are working for too many Harvard and Princeton graduates".

<url>http://fixedreference.org/en/20040424/wikipedia/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology</url>

However, let me clear some things up:
[quote]CEO of Sun Microsystem... etc..[/quote]

No, Scott McNealy does not have an engineering degree from Harvard. He has a degree in Economics from Harvard. In fact, of the 4 original founders of Sun (McNealy, Vinod Khosla, Bill Joy, and Andy Bechtolsheim), he is the only one who has no engineering degree at all (the other 3 founders all have bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering).
[quote]An Wang (Electrical Engineering, invented Magnetic Tape eg) video tape, floppy disk etc..)[/quote]

I believe An Wang's Harvard PhD was in Applied Physics, not EE. Is Applied Physics really engineering? You be the judge.
[quote]Fischer Black ( father of Financial Engineering )[/quote]

Fischer Black's PhD was in Applied Mathematics, not engineering. Furthermore I don't know that Financial Engineering is really 'engineering'. If you want to say that it is, then I would say that the MIT Department of Economics and the MIT Sloan School have no shortage of stud financial engineers. Heck, Fischer Black is best known for the Black-Scholes equation, which is a method to value financial options. Black, Scholes, and Robert Merton (who won the Nobel Prize in Economics with Scholes in 1997, which Black would have won too if he were still alive in 1997) were all, at some point in their career, professors at the MIT Sloan School.

Heck, if you really want to go down this road, the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve (replacing Greenspan), Ben Bernanke, got his PhD in Economics at MIT. Bernanke is clearly the most powerful economist in the world.
[quote]Bill Gates &amp; Steven Ballmer[/quote]

Bill Gates did not graduate. Steve Ballmer's Harvard degree is in applied math + economics, not engineering.


Nevertheless, all of the examples you have pointed out illustrate that you don't really "need" a true engineering degree to work as an engineer or to succeed at an engineering company. This seems to be especially true in high-tech, where plenty of people with degrees in the natural sciences or mathematics nevertheless invent many of the most important inventions in the industry. The Turing Award is widely considered to be the "Nobel Prize" of computer science, yet a significant fraction of them have been won by people who do not hold CS or eng degrees (but rather, hold PhD's in mathematics or physics). Quite a few highly successful computer companies have been founded by people who never graduated from college at all, most notably Microsoft (neither Gates nor Paul Allen graduated), but also Oracle, Apple (both Jobs and Wozniak dropped out, although Wozniak later returned and graduated), and Dell.

Granted, all of those founders were true "hands-on" people who most likely either would have gotten their engineering degrees or would have been good enough to pass as one. Gates and Allen didn't have degrees but were pretty darn good coders back in their day. Larry Ellison was quite knowledgeable about computer science. Jobs and Wozniak had excellent EE and circuitry skills, despite not having engineering degrees. Especially Wozniak, who was widely regarded as a prodigy at EE. Michael Dell was a very good PC tech and engineer back in the days when PC's were still considered to be obscure technologies. While none of these guys got engineering degrees (or any degrees at all), I think it's safe to say that they were a match for anybody who did have engineering degrees.

But then there are other people who rise to the top of engineering companies despite not having engineering degrees and not pretending to have engineering knowledge. Many engineering companies are run by non-engineers. Scott McNealy, CEO of Sun, is a businessman, not an engineer, and he doesn't pretend to be an engineer. Sam Palmisano, CEO of IBM, is not an engineer. His bachelor's degree is in history from Johns Hopkins. His expertise is in business management, not engineering. John Chambers, CEO of Cisco Systems, has degrees in business and law, not engineering. He's a salesman.
He rose from the sales division, not the engineering division. Terry Semel, CEO of Yahoo, is not an engineer. He's a former Hollywood executive at Warner Brothers whose expertise is in marketing and entertainment production, not engineering (and certainly not computer science).

Heck, look at some of the highly successful MIT graduates who made it to the top. Carly Fiorina was former (and infamous) head of HP, and formerly the most powerful woman in business according to Fortune Magazine.  She's an MIT graduate - but not an engineering degree, but rather she came from the MIT Sloan School, holding a master's degree in management from the Sloan Fellows program. Her undergrad degree is in medieval history/philosophy from Stanford. She's no engineer - her expertise is in marketing. She had a brilliant career in marketing at Lucent and AT&amp;T. {Heck, the current CEO of HP, Mark Hurd, is no engineer either, holding degrees in business and who rose from the sales ranks to get to the top}.

How about some other MIT grads who rose to the top? Duane Ackerman is head of Bellsouth. He's an MIT grad, but, again, from the Sloan School, where he got a master's degree in management. His undergrad degree is in physics. John Thompson is CEO of the antivirus company Symantec, and is also an MIT graduate from the Sloan School, and doesn't hold any engineering degrees. Dan Carp, former CEO of Kodak, is also a MIT Sloan graduate, and whose other degrees are in business and math.


The point is, you don't <b> need </b> an engineering degree to run an engineering company. There are many ways to get to the top of an engineering company. You can get there through sales, finance, marketing, business development, HR, and so forth. Furthermore, you sometimes don't even need an engineering degree to work as an engineer. This seems to be especially true in many high-tech fields where they don't care much about your degree, they only care about what you know how to do. Tech companies in Silicon Valley are replete with people who don't have degrees but have very good computer and engineering skills.

FIscher Black, Bill Gates, An Wang, Steven Ballmer chose to attend Harvard Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences (DEAS). Applied Math, Applied Physics, Computer Sciences are programs at Harvard Division of Engineering.

You can not say certain program is not engineering program because the name does not contain 'engineering'.

First off, there is no such thing as the "Harvard Division of Engineering". There is only the "Division of Engineering and Applied Science". There are <b> TWO </b> topics in that division. That's why it's called DEAS, not just DE. Why is it called DEAS if everything in there is engineering? Why not just call it DE then?

Hence, all of those people you named were did not get study in the Harvard Department of Engineering, because there is no such thing. There is only the Department of Engineering and Applied Science. All of those guys resided in the Applied Science part of DEAS.

[quote]Many other schools offer Applied Physics, Applied Math or Computer Sci degrees by schools of engineering.[/quote]

But many others do not. For example, applied math at Berkeley is NOT taught in the College of Engineering. Rather, it is taught in the College of Letters and Science.

<url>http://ls.berkeley.edu/dept/</url>

Applied Math at MIT is taught within the MIT Math Department, which is housed in the School of Science, not in the School of Engineering.

<url>http://www-math.mit.edu/applied/</url>


Besides, let me put it to you this way. You say that applied math, applied physics, and CS are all engineering degrees at Harvard. Yet, the fact is, according to ABET, the only accredited engineering degree you can earn at Harvard is the SB degree. You can see this for yourself here.

<url>http://www.abet.org</url>

So to get an accredited engineering degree at Harvard, you must earn the SB. Oh, but what's this here? According to DEAS, you cannot earn an SB in applied mathematics, computer science, or engineering physics. You can only earn an (unaccredited) AB degree.

<url>http://www.deas.harvard.edu/undergradstudy/</url>

<url>http://www.deas.harvard.edu/undergradstudy/engineeringsciences/index.html</url>

So, let's say you're right. Let's say that applied math, applied physics (engineering physics), and computer science at Harvard are engineering degrees. Then why doesn't Harvard allow people to get the ABET-accredited SB degree in those fields? Is Harvard or ABET being stupid?

You are right in that Gates' success had nothing to do with his (incomplete) Harvard education, but it also had nothing really to do with user-friendliness per-se. Like all other successful business men he "saw his opportunities and he took them". Gates is definitely a brilliant man, but his engineering skills are debatable. Altair BASIC was a very simple 8080 assembly language program and MSDOS was actually just a stripped-down clone of CP/M that was written by somebody else (Gates bought QDOS from soembody else and renamed it MSDOS). OS/2 came some years later and was quite userfriendly, but failed because Microsoft pulled out of the joint OS/2 project between IBM and Microsoft and started their own project (Windows NT), and due to their existing hold on the market, they were able to wipe out OS/2 with propaganda and advertisements. Off the subject, I know, but I like to argue about computer stuff :). Interestingly enough, Gates' businessman views actually brought him in to conflict with the hackers at Berkeley and MIT during the late 70s and early 80s.

Anyway, I would choose MIT for the great enviornment, but either one would be a great choice I'm sure.

Who are the famous MIT alumnus of Engineering, Natural Sciences and Math programs, who became successful in business world ?

22.<<<sakky>>>
[quote]Gates is definitely a brilliant man, but his engineering skills are debatable.[/quote]

I don't think anybody is trying to say that Gates is the greatest engineer of all time.

What makes him impressive is that he knows far more about engineering, and specifically about software coding, than most tech CEO's do. Say what you will about his coding deficiencies, but at least he was there in the trenches, getting into the weeds, dealing with all the hairiness of writing good code. Very few other CEO's of tech companies can say the same thing. Most are just businessmen and salesmen. For example, John Chambers of Cisco is not an engineer. Neither is Sam Palmisano of IBM. Mark Hurd of HP. Scott McNealy of Sun. Terry Semel of Yahoo. Meg Whitman of Ebay. Larry Probst of Electronic Arts.

Even those CEO's who do have substantial software backgrounds were probably not ever as good as Bill Gates was at it. For example, while Steve Jobs of Apple and Larry Ellison of Oracle were former coders, I suspect that Bill Gates was a better one. Obviously we can never prove that, but I believe it is true.

About the only major tech company that I can think of whose CEO is certainly a better coder than Gates was is Google, with Dr. Eric Schmidt, PhD in computer science from UCBerkeley, and lead developer of the Java programming language while at Sun.

But the point is, people who are both very good at software and in running large tech companies are few and far between. Gates may not be the greatest at software, but he's clearly a lot better than most other CEO's of major tech companies are.

William Hewlett, who is the H in HP, got his MS in EECS from MIT.

Ken Olsen, founder of the former computer giant DEC (which is now part of HP) got his bachelor's and MS in EECS from MIT.

Robert Noyce, co-founder and the first CEO of Intel, got his PhD in physics from MIT.

John Thain, the current CEO of the New York Stock Exchange, got his bachelors degree in EECS from MIT.

Andrew Viterbi, who is the co-founder of the mobile phone giant Qualcomm, got his bachelor's and master's in electrical engineering.

Tom Perkins, of arguably the most prestigious venture capital firm in the world, Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers, got his bachelor's in EECS from MIT.

Amar Bose, founder of the Bose Corporation (audio equipment), got his PhD in EE from MIT.

I could go on and on, as there are many other companies on the list. But I think the point is clear.
James McDonnell, cofounder of the aerospace company McDonnell &amp; Douglas (now part of Boeing), got his master's degree in aerospace engineering from MIT.

Robert Swanson, cofounder of Genentech, holds a bachelor's degree in chemistry from MIT (as well as a master's degree in management from the MIT Sloan School).

I believe it was a joint degree. Back in the old days, MIT and Harvard used to offer lots of joint degree programs. They still do, especially in the Health Sciences and Technology program which is run jointly.

However, I'll say this. According to the MIT alumni database, Vannevar Bush received an EGD degree (a Doctor of Engineering degree) in EECS (course 6) from MIT in 1916. But he does not show up in the Harvard alumni database at all. So is he really a Harvard alumni? I guess it depends on how you define the word "alumni"?

27.<<<mdx49>>>
According to wikipedia.com, Harvard finished first place 24 times( as of 2004) and MIT finished first place 5 times in William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition. I think MIT math &amp; applied math department is about 5 times bigger than that of Harvard. and almost everyone at MIT is doing some kind of applied math( enginnering, physical sciences etc..)

Harvard Math is admitting about only 7 math PhDs per year and MIT is admitting about 30 PhDs per year.

I thought Harvard Math is like a 'sidkick' department at Harvard, but they are doing much better than MIT math people..

I also heard that most of the Top performers of american math competitions usually choose to attend Harvard instead of MIT or other schools.

Is this true ?

How come Math students at Liberal Arts school are doing much better than those at Science &amp; Technology school in Putnam Math competitions ?

28.<<<sakky>>>
Your initial assumption is flawed. Harvard math is not a 'sidekick' department by any means.

According to USNews, Harvard is tied for the #2 ranked graduate math department in the country (MIT is #1). According to the 1995 NRC ranking, Harvard was ranked 4th with a 4.90 score, vs. MIT ranked 3rd with a 4.92 score. A 0.02 difference in score is meaningless.

<url>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/phdsci/premium/mat.php</url>

Whether you see Harvard as having the 2nd or the 4th strongest graduate math department, it is hardly a 'sidekick' department. How can you have such a strong ranking and be a 'sidekick'?

I also fail to see what this has to do with the Putnam competition, which is available only to undergrads. What does the size of the department or the number of graduate students have anything to do with a competition that is open only to undergrads?

Look, the truth is that the Harvard math program is probably very good for the kinds of things that are tested in the Putnam. Heck, I see that the Harvard math department has a specific website devoted to the Putnam. The MIT math department does not seem to focus on Putnam. Nevertheless, the MIT department is still ranked (slightly) higher than the Harvard math department in the 2 most respected graduate rankings (NRC and USNews).

Secondly, liberal arts includes sciences. If you look at the definition of 'liberal arts', you will see that mathematics (arithmetic and geometry) was part of the liberal arts. So it makes perfect sense for a liberal arts school like Harvard to be extremely good at mathematics. This is not strange at all, and certainly math is no 'sidekick' department.

<url>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts</url>

In fact, what would be weird is for a liberal arts school to NOT have a strong mathematics program. If you're not strong in math, then you're not really a balanced liberal arts school.

29.<<<Mikalye>>>
It is interesting. You can point to top graduates of both schools, but the last time that I looked at the statistics (which admittedly was a few years ago) it was clear that both on a percentage basis and in absolute terms, the number of Harvard alum that reach the top of their profession is appreciably higher than at MIT. It is also true that the MEDIAN income of MIT grads comes in appreciably higher than the equivalent at Harvard.

I graduated from MIT, I had a lot of friends at Harvard. I went to a bunch of Harvard parties, I got to know it moderately well. I personally perferred MIT. Anecdotally, I seemed to have better access to senior faculty than was available to my friends at Harvard (for example, one of MIT's Nobel Laureates is teaching two sections of freshman physics - that seemed to be much less likely to occur at Harvard). I found more people on the MIT campus who thought the way I did, and a much lower level of pretention. But everyone is different. You may prefer Harvard, and heck, good luck to you there.

At the level of these schools, there is really no such thing as one school being BETTER than the other. This is the basis of the admissions counsellors talking so long and often about the importance of MATCH. There will be some students who are a better match for Harvard and will prosper and thrive there, others who are a better match for MIT. In the rare case that an applicant has been accepted at both schools and has a free choice, it is a huge mistake to sit down and to rationally pick the BETTER school. There isn't such a thing. Rather visit both campuses (which are all of fifteen minutes apart), talk to people, and figure out where you would be happier.

PS: And if you really want to be CEO of a tech company, where you did your undergraduate degree does not matter at all. What matters is where you did your MBA.

30.<<<mdx49>>>
Putnam Math competition is one of the most prestigious math competition at undergraduate level in US. Harvard has a specific web site devoted to the Putnam, because Harvard has been a top winner most of the time: they want to show off.

Maybe MIT math department does not focus on Punam because they are behind Harvard team most of the time.

I also know that the top winners of high school math competition in US usually choose to attend Harvard math department and I guess that is why Harvard has been doing extremely well in that competition.

31.<<<mootmom>>>
mdx49, are you considering attending MIT? Are you evaluating whether to attend Harvard instead? I'm curious as to the point of your thread here, and the posts you keep adding that continue to disparage or cast doubt on MIT in some way. You've received some very thoughtful replies from a number of people here, I hope they've been helpful in your decisions.

32.<<<pebbles>>>
It sounds like he's trying to justify choosing Harvard over MIT.

Anyways, mdx, I hope those Putnam math competition winners and those famous alumni keep you warm during those cold lonely Boston winters.

33.<<<sakky>>>
Mdx49, nobody is denying that the Harvard math program is extremely strong. Nobody can fault you for going to Harvard to study math.

However, let's not deny that the MIT math program is also extremely strong. After all the rankings indicate that the MIT graduate math program is ranked (slightly) higher than Harvard's is. And yes, MIT touts this fact. So just like you say that MIT does not tout the Putnam because MIT is behind Harvard when it comes to the Putnam, I could similarly say that Harvard does not tout the NRC or the USNEws graduate rankings for math departments because Harvard is behind MIT. So the same mentality applies.

34.<<<tech_fan>>>
Harvard has a tiny permanent math faculty that is of extremely high quality. (The size probably accounts for the rankings.) MIT has a much larger faculty that is also very good. Each department certainly has its own "feel" and you should figure out what that is when you visit and whether it suits you.

Harvard's graduate school in math is certainly harder to get into than MIT's, for what it's worth.

35.<<<live->>>
If you have the privilege of choosing between MIT and Harvard, I can say quite confidently I think the decision will have very little impact on your life (and ensuing success in it).

And one more thing: anyone that says Bill Gates isn't very skilled as a software engineer is arrogant beyond belief. Windows didn't end up with a 90+% market share because its founder (and original writer) couldn't program.

37.<<<sakky>>>
Well, actually, live, it wouldn't be unprecedented. There are some examples of fantastically successful computer companies founded and led by people who had minimal engineering knowledge.

For example, consider IBM. Most people today don't realize just how fantastically dominant IBM used to be in the industry. But as some pundits put it, in the 1960's and 1970's, IBM wasn't just the flagship of the US computer industry, it was the whole fleet. Basically, IBM at that time dominated absolutely every single piece of the computer industry. Hardware, software, applications, networking equipment, computer services, peripherals, printers, etc. etc. You name it, IBM dominated it. IBM did everything. IBM invented the disk drive. It made its own microprocessors. It made its own memory. It made its own motherboards. It pieced them all together into its systems (its mainframes). In fact, IBM invented the idea of a 'compatible computer system' (as opposed to individual custom-made computers that were not compatible with any other computer in the world). It wrote the operating system for those mainframes. It wrote application software to sit on top of the operating system. It made networking equipment to connect the mainframes to terminals. It made those terminals. In short, IBM used to be far more dominant than Microsoft ever was, and probably ever will be.

Yet the fact is, IBM's early leaders were not engineers. The legendary Tom Watson Sr, who took over the Computer-Tabulating-Recording company, and then later changed its name to IBM, was not an engineer. He was a salesman. His son, the equally legendary Tom Watson Jr., who took over IBM from his father, was also a salesman, not an engineer. (Granted, the CTR company was founded by a mechanical engineering whiz, but it sold tabulating machines, not computers at the time that it was taken over by Watson Sr.)

The point is, it's not unprecedented for a computer company to achieve great success while being led by a person who is not a computer whiz. I doubt that the Watsons knew a whole lot about the intricacies of computer engineering, yet that didn't prevent IBM from rising to dominance.

Don't get me wrong. I agree with you that Bill Gates is a pretty darn good coder, and almost certainly far better than most of the leaders of most computer companies out there. I'm just saying that you don't personally need to be a good coder to run a successful computer company.

40.<<<DakSmack>>>
Please excuse any language I use, but I am simply perplexed by the weight you are giving to the most superflous details when trying to decide between schools. I applied to MIT and not Harvard, even though both my dad and sister went to Harvard. Last October, I spent several days in Boston, talking to faculty at both schools. I talked to the Dean of Mechanical Engineering at Harvard and she explicitly told me that people who do engineering at Harvard often use this degree as a tool to launch them into other careers, primarily in business and economics. She used the example of the cell phone. She talked about how at MIT, every time the professors see a cell phone, they are amazed by the technological advances. At Harvard, the professors don't have this same level of passion towards technological advances such as cell phones. She also talked about how for the frosh orientation for the ME students, she brought in a rocket and launched it. The students were unimpressed. She claimed that something like this would never happen at MIT, because people have much greater devotion to math and physics.

In other words, you have to weigh what you want from a college, NOT look at people who graduated from there and how many stupid math competitions they won. Guess what? Are you incapable of being the worlds next richest man if you go to MIT? no. When Bill Gates chose to go to Harvard, was it because he felt it would make him the richest man alive? Probably not. You shouldn't view other peoples' successes/failures as an indication of your own merit. When you get back a test that you did poorly on, do you just say "well everyone else did bad, so I guess it's ok." No, you should view yourself as an independent individual who is capable of doing whatever you want. Trust me, MIT engineering would not hold you back from reaching your potential.
