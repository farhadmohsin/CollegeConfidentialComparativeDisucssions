Hello! Among some other schools, Hamilton, Carleton, and Grinnell have admitted me for next year. But these three seem so similar and I would greatly appreciate CC’s insight.
(NOTE: Hamilton has admitted me as a Jan. Start and I’m intrigued by the program in London. I’m currently working on a contingency plan in case London is cancelled.)
I’d like to study public policy/international relations and psychology/neuroscience, which is partly why I love the open curriculums at Grinnell and Hamilton. I also enjoy how the trimester schedule at Carleton will ensure that I can deeply study material with only 3 classes at a time. Furthermore, I want to grow my relationship with the outdoors, journalism, and civic engagement wherever I attend.
As a potential political major, it’s important to me that I can talk and live with classmates of different backgrounds and ideals. But I’m concerned that a place like Grinnell/Carleton may be too homogenous, in terms of political ideology, to name one example. Similarly, I know that Hamilton struggles with diversity of race, as another example.
Socially, I wonder if I’d benefit from a more balanced culture like Hamilton’s (e.g. light side vs dark side) or a slanted one like Carleton or Grinnell’s, if these distinctions are accurate. I also wonder how these schools differ in terms of nightlife/social scene.
These schools seem to have superb programs for my majors, strong endowments to survive the coronavirus, and a strong quality of life, right? Are there any more distinctions that you can make between these schools, perhaps reputation-wise, student-body-wise, or student services-wise?
Where, ultimately, would you suggest that I attend out of these three?

Based on the depth of your interests, you would make a great addition to any of these academically top-notch schools.
With respect to your choice, Hamilton offers some programs that would align especially well for you. Hamilton is one of the very few liberal arts colleges that offer a major in public policy; similarly uncommonly, it offers a long-established term-length program in Washington, D.C.; and its especially flexible curriculum combined with the range of its available programs suits the diversity of your academic interests. For exploring the natural world, you could seek your inner Buck in the iconic Adirondacks (January admits participate in August orientation programs).

You might want to look at this ranking, since studying social science areas such as international relations and public policy often involves courses in economics:

I’m most familiar with Carleton because I’m an alum.  I also have some familiarity with Grinnell.  I know less about Hamilton.
First, all three are excellent schools.  Is cost an issue?  I’d give that a lot of weight in these times.
You are correct in that Carleton and Grinnell are very similar in terms of vibe and general campus culture.  Both are VERY liberal, with Grinnell being a little more so.  Less than 1 percent of students at these schools voted for Trump.  If you supported Biden or Clinton in the '20 and '16 primaries, respectively, you’d be considered right of center at these schools.  Even back in the 1980s, I remember a poll of one of the Carleton senior classes and more people supported socialism than capitalism.  I have seen both schools on various “most liberal colleges in America”-type lists.  Both are frequently on Princeton Review’s list of Most Liberal Students, whereas I can’t remember seeing Hamilton on that list (at least not recently).  Both Carleton and Grinnell have also been mentioned in “best colleges for hippies”-type lists, whereas I don’t think I’ve ever seen Hamilton on those.
All three schools are majority white.  I believe Grinnell is the most ethnically diverse of the three and Hamilton the least, but it’s not a super huge difference, at least according to figures I can find.  Grinnell also has the most international students.  I believe Grinnell is probably also the most socioeconomically diverse, but I could be wrong on that.  Carleton and Grinnell have a large number of LGBT students (on the order of 25% to 35%).  I don’t know what the numbers are at Hamilton.  Hamilton is probably the most ideologically diverse and overall the most moderate, but all three colleges lean left.  By the way, note that the countryside surrounding all three of these schools is actually a lot more conservative.  If you make an effort to get “outside the bubble” of all these schools, you’ll discover quite a different cultural, political, religious and economic environment.  All three colleges have roughly equal percentages of male-identifying and female-identifying students.  Carleton probably has the most regional (geographic) diversity (when excluding foreign students).
My experience with psychology at Carleton was … not so good.  However, that was mostly due to one professor who is no longer there.
I’ve heard positive things from a few people who did the neuroscience concentration/minor, including one of my former roommates who went on to get a PhD in the subject.  There’s also a brand new science building on campus.
The political science department was home to two great luminaries: Paul Wellstone and Steven Schier, who represented different, complimentary, aspects of the field.  Schier represented the intellectual side of the discipline, emphasizing rigor, research, data, analysis.  Wellstone emphasized activism, involvement and civic engagement and the experiential, human side of the field.  Schier has retired and Wellstone was killed in an airplane crash.  I’m not sure how the deparment has faired without these two giants, but hopefully their spirits are still felt.  There also used to be an off-campus studies program in D.C., but it doesn’t seem to be offered anymore.

5.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
Thanks so much for your responses, @hokupaa @merc81 @apple23  ,  Can you or someone also speak on the night-life/social gatherings and activities, especially considering that Ham has limited greek life while Grinnell and Carleton don’t…? Do you think that what was stated earlier about the student body plays a role in student activity?

6.<<<merc81>>>
@ilovemybed222: I’m not sure that college parties have changed that much through time. If you would like to explore a novel or film depicting Hamilton, read or watch The Sterile Cuckoo. Of course there’ll be many activities available to you aside from parties, but this will get you started with respect to atmosphere.

7.<<<Publisher>>>
OP: I think that you are right to be attracted to a 3 course trimester system (Dartmouth College & Carleton College).
Obviously, Carleton College experiences the most severe weather of the three.
Hamilton’s January start is interesting, but London may well be cancelled if a second wave of coronavirus hits in the Fall as predicted.

8.<<<merc81>>>
Hamilton’s social atmosphere benefits from its spatial range. You will find three residential neighborhoods, each with its own architectural and social character. Hamilton also offers two main dining halls along with five other places to eat. By choosing where to eat and live, your social experiences will have desirably fluid aspects there. Another social aspect to consider might be gender ratio. Hamilton’s balance in its last enrolled class settled at 50/50.

9.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
Wait, three neighborhoods? I thought they were only two: light and dark side. Interesting…
When I think about it more, I think I like the open curriculum idea better because I can explore more subjects — And I know I have a lot of interests so that might be beneficial for me.
I would also like to learn more about reputation and how it relates to finding careers. Does one school have a better or at least distinctive one? What school’s name pulls the most weight?

10.<<<merc81>>>
Like quarks, Hamilton’s campus comes in three colors — light, dark and *grey/i.
Regarding post-graduation opportunities, you can check U.S. News for early career salary information. Hamilton graduates perform well in this area, registering the highest median figure from among the 10 NESCAC LACs.

Our S19 was admitted to all three schools last year. You have some good info above but I do not agree that Carleton and Grinnell are super liberal. We visited both campuses twice. We found kids really mainstream. Nothing like a place like Oberlin where we thought it was teeming with social justice warriors. I would not call Grinnell or Carleton any more liberal than most college campuses. S19 spent a good amount of time with young alums from both schools (alums in their early 20s) and they were not hippies in the least. Both had corporate jobs and were very bright and mainstream.

12.<<<Midwestmomofboys>>>
While we know students from Carleton and Hamilton – all of whom loved their experience –  Grinnell is the only school we have direct experience with as both my kids visited, did overnights, and one was a recruited athlete there.
What my kids (and us grown ups) loved about Grinnell was the range of students, and that everyone seemed to mix and mingle and get along, there were not “silos” of kids. For example, when my recruited athlete had meal with team, unlike most schools where that really was just with teammates, at Grinnell, it was the team plus a whole bunch of other students, who ranged from blue hair to Polo shirts. And everyone seemed to enjoy each other. Both my kids really enjoyed the culture at Grinnell, and the classes they sat in on. Town had its charms – no better or worse than, for ex., Oberlin, Ohio, in that it has the basics a college student needs – excellent grocery with lots of interesting beers, organic foods, prepared foods etc., plus pizza shops, doughnut shop, bike shop, independent movie theater etc. My kids liked that there was a single dining hall at Grinnell, so that everyone passed through there at some point, and the food was really good. I can’t compare it to the other choices, but Grinnell is a wonderful community, with deep resources, a commitment to socio-economic, racial and ethnic diversity, and unusually good sciences for a LAC. Plus, both kids liked the flexible curriculum which meant – for my non-STEMy kids – no one would force them to take more math/science if they didn’t want to. (Of course, they both wound up at schools with more distribution requirements and had to take math AND science). My spouse and I agree, if only we had a 3rd child, maybe that one would have finally chosen Grinnell!

From College Navigator:

I.e. all are quite underrepresented for the lower half income/wealth (Pell), but Grinnell is less overrepresented for the top 5% (no grants/scholarships).

14.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
Thank you to everyone who has responded so far! Helpful to hear multiple perspectives.
@homerdog Did your S19 end up picking one of these schools? Do you mind sharing why or why not?

15.<<<homerdog>>>
@ilovemybed222 He is at Bowdoin. We didn’t visit Hamilton before he applied. He was accepted to seven schools he did visit so he decided to narrow his choices down to those he saw before applying. He’s a sporty and artsy kid and felt most at home at Bowdoin. We live in the Midwest and he was looking to get away for college. He definitely thought he could have had a great academic experience at Carleton or Grinnell but was swayed by the friendly, bright kids at Bowdoin and the beauty of Maine and the ocean.
He did think the town had more to offer at Carleton and he liked that it was close to Minneapolis. Grinnell is even more of a bubble with very little going on in the town. But that bubble is pretty awesome. Grinnell has a ton of money and is very supportive of whatever a student wants to do on campus. We felt, too, like fewer kids went into the work force from Grinnell. It’s seemed great for kids who wanted to go to grad school or med school but their career services seemed more lacking than Carleton’s where more companies seemed to visit, etc. S19 isn’t planning grad school and Bowdoin has a strong record of job placement after graduation so that was also a pull for him.

16.<<<homerdog>>>
If you don’t want to start in January, I think Carleton fits you better. I just reread your opening post and there’s more to do in the “outdoors” at Carleton. That’s really not a thing in rural Iowa. I think there’s probably more options for someone interested in politics at Carleton since it’s fairly close to Minneapolis. Political science is not one of the bigger majors at Grinnell.

17.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
@homerdog Very fair points. Thanks!
So I think what’s great about all three schools in terms of the outdoors is they have land preserves open for research and student use.  Carleton has the 800 acre arb, Grinnell has their 500 acre CERA prairie, and Hamilton has the 8 miles of Glenns and trails. All three schools have big outdoor clubs, too…but since I love alpine skiing, I’m somewhat swayed by ice coast (if you know what I mean there). I think Ham may win in that dept. in terms of fit for me since there also are different ski resorts nearby-ish…
But I do really like the accessibility to the Twin Cities for Carleton for internships, connections, and what have you (I also like how it is much close to home, being from the midwest).
and @ucbalumnus would you think it is fair to assume international populations will decrease due to COVID-19?

18.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Due to travel difficulties, it would not be surprising if international student populations fall.

19.<<<apple23>>>
With respect to your interest in natural features, Hamilton’s Root Glen is home to a Norway spruce that has received national recognition:
https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/26/nyregion/new-york-has-top-norway-spruce.html
If you are not sure how to picture Hamilton’s natural areas, they connect to its central campus, and can be used for walking, running, nordic skiing, or relaxing on a daily basis.
For alpine skiing, New York has more ski resorts than any other state, and is a two-time Winter Olympics site. For off-campus hiking, Hamilton’s outing club sponsors activities such as 46 Peaks Weekend:

20.<<<healani>>>
Three terrific choices.  Although Hamilton’s Jan start may be intriguing, I think it is not ideal, especially in current environment.  I suspect Grinnell may have a bit of an “off” year for yield due to its reliance on internationals.  Carleton’s trimester calendar does not start until mid-September, which may be an advantage in these strange times.  I believe Carleton graduates more psychology majors than either Hamilton or Grinnell.  Finally, I agree with the post above the Carleton is going to connect you with the outdoors more than Grinnell.  All considered, I think Carleton makes a strong case to be your top pick–although net financial cost to OP should be considered.

21.<<<merc81>>>
Since you range widely in your interests, you might appreciate that preeminent American psychologist B. F. Skinner graduated from Hamilton.

22.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
@merc81 I actually was very excited to hear about that. Thanks for bringing it up again!
And @healani It’s difficult understanding if a delayed admission next year is a good or a bad thing. Ham’s program will likely be canceled, but it may be worth wondering how likely it will be for online courses to take place next semester - and maybe skipping those is a good thing…everything else you said about Carleton is compelling, though.

23.<<<merc81>>>
@ilovemybed222: I’ve found your comments to be informative as well. Somehow I’d never heard of Grinnell’s Prairie, for example.

24.<<<starjoy8>>>
CERA is a really amazing thing to experience. I’m in the Grinnell Singers and we always do a retreat there in the Fall. We walk around and sing and it’s just a really cool experience. They also do a lot to marry arts to that space. Of course, our intro bio classes sometimes focus on prairie studies and go out there, but there are often art exhibits or traveling performances that take place in the prairie center’s space which I feel is pretty unique.
All that said, my parents (and I now that covid has displaced me from Grinnell) live near Hamilton and I LOVE upstate NY nature. It gets cold here for longer than in Grinnell, but I think Grinnell’s coldest date was colder (don’t quote me on this). For example, I am currently sitting in front of our wood fire writing this because it was below 30 last night.
Here is the link to more of my thoughts about Grinnell’s social life. let me know if you have specific questions for me: https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/discussion/comment/22753100#Comment_22753100

25.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
@starjoy8 Wow! Very helpful and detailed. Thank you!
UPDATE: I have received some more offers from LAC’s that I really like and have some questions, although I don’t want to change this chat’s subject. Can someone who understands the NESCAC’s PM me since I am unable to start one, being a new member?

26.<<<merc81>>>
@starjoy8: I remember you from your search process — I’m glad you seem to be thriving at Grinnell!

27.<<<Lindagaf>>>
In general, Hamilton is more conservative than the others. I think Carleton is the best choice, because it’s probably a little more “nerdy” than the other two. Nerds aren’t generally associated with extreme views in any direction, lol. It’s trimester system can be intense, but is great for kids who thrive on that and want to get more in-depth with a subject. It’s not far to a major city, so transportation shouldn’t be problematic. As far as weather, well, they will all be cold in the winter.
I know something about the NESCACs as I have a senior at Bates. I will pm you.
ETA: sent you a pm, @ilovemybed222

28.<<<itsmedrew>>>
Hamilton! I have a friend that goes there. Congrats!

29.<<<juillet>>>
I don’t know that the 3/3 calendar at Carleton necessarily gives you more time or allows you to think about things more deeply than a semester or quarter system.
In their FAQ they point out that Carleton students have more terms (12) than a semester student (8). But you’re also taking fewer classes per term (3-4) than the average semester student takes per semester (4-6) so it evens out in the end. Both students are going to end up taking 36-40 or so courses over four years.
They also say you don’t have to declare your major until the end of sophomore year, but that’s true at most liberal arts college (and most colleges, period). They use chemistry as an example, but that’s probably the worst they could’ve use. The Carleton chemistry department says themselves that chemistry is a highly structured major, and recommend you have finished certain classes (including organic chemistry) by sophomore year.
There are 9 of those classes - 10 if you don’t place into chemistry 123 - and they build; the basic required chemistry sequence takes four trimesters, and those classes gate everything else in the major. If you wait until the beginning of your junior year to take them, you can’t take anything else in the chemistry major until the winter (second) trimester of your senior year, and have only two more trimesters to finish your chemistry major.
In practice, it looks like this works out…pretty much like any other liberal arts college. Students can technically take until sophomore year to declare, but in practice it’s better if they identify a general area of interest early on take the prerequisite classes in their first two years while they are deciding what exactly they want to major in. Or they run the risk of taking more than 4 years to graduate, which is totally fine, but not what most students want or expect.

30.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
@juillet That’s very interesting. Thank you for sharing. In totality, now what I am feeling about Carleton is that it is just plain-old academically difficult, in terms of the calendar set-up. Because in this case, there’s finals three times a year (and extra midterms). Plus, I remember how hard the senior comps are made out to be for each major (bye-bye, double majoring) and I wonder if I would be happy there if I were so stressed. Socially, I think I explained earlier that I don’t necessarily want to be in an environment that is so slanted in one direction (in Carleton’s case, it is liberal/counterculture, I suppose).

31.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
UPDATE: Earlier, I mentioned that I got into more schools yesterday, and I’m happy to say that Colby and Colorado College have offered me admission. Those two schools are very impressive and likely now are in my top 3, along with Hamilton. If you have read my posts, then I hope that you will understand why.
At this point, I am not really looking for more information on Grinnell/Carleton, unless someone has thoughts to share. In that case, please feel free to do so.
And I’m not sure if I should make a new thread, but I’m always happy to hear any opinions regarding where I am at now. Thank you to all who have helped me so far! I deeply appreciate it all.

32.<<<Lindagaf>>>
@ilovemybed222 , if you flag your original post, it will ask you to report the problem. You can ask a moderator to add in your original post that you’ve been offered Colby and Colorado College. You’ll get better answers.
I will tag @gardenstategal

33.<<<Mwfan1921>>>
Congratulations on your new acceptances.
I will start out by asking what your thoughts are re: Colorado College’s block calendar? Obviously you applied so it must have some appeal, but now that you have other attractive offers (Colby, Hamilton), what are your thoughts?
I have been to both Hamilton and Colby and was impressed by both. Seems like there is more in walking distance to Hamilton than Colby (but still close to a mile walk), but students are friendly at both.
I can’t comment on the relative strength of majors, but do take a look at the professors, their education, and their research in your departments of interest, and requirement for major/minors. Also take a look at how many students major each year in your areas of interest too…this is on the CDS and/or IPEDs.

34.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
@Mwfan1921 Thanks for the message. I do like CC’s block plan, and it is especially convenient due to COVID-19 (they can easily come back on campus mid semester). Students grow close with their peers/profs in each class due to Block Plan, too. But I don’t love how they don’t have as large an emphasis on the social sciences that I am interested in, and I feel like class registration/double majoring would be difficult. But I also like how culturally, the kids have a lot of fun in CO Springs and surrounding areas.
The next point about comparing CC’s education to Hamilton and Colby seem to be very minute. Even so, Colby and Hamilton seem have a better academic reputation and more distinguished professors. More significantly, the two NESCACs have much stronger emphases on social sciences. All three have great opps for civic engagement but perhaps especially Colby due to strong relations with Waterville (whereas CC is like a bubble inside of CO Springs). Then again, a lot more opps in CO Springs because it is bigger.
Finally, I like Ham’s open curriculum most out of all three, but I value Colby’s Jan Plan and again, I like the principle of the Block Plan.
Biggest concern about Colby is social life…is it as dynamic as CC and Ham? I did see “Colby Life” documentary and was most concerned there. But I’ve heard it has improved a lot by President Greene, so who knows…

35.<<<RockySoil>>>
When I think about it more, I think I like the open curriculum idea better because I can explore more subjects — And I know I have a lot of interests so that might be beneficial for me.
One advantage of the trimester system at Carleton is that you take 36 courses in 4 years vs. only 32 in the semester system, so you can explore more subjects.

There seems to be lots of chatter on these forums about taking a gap semester for fall 2020, due to the possible loss of “the residential college experience” that they feel is what they are paying a premium for.  Such students/parents would probably like to be in your position of getting a spring admission (unlike in other years where spring admission is normally considered less desirable).
https://www.hamilton.edu/admission/apply/january-admission/january
https://www.hamilton.edu/admission/apply/january-admission/jancourses
https://www.hamilton.edu/admission/apply/january-admission/jan-explained
Although they push their own or associated programs for the fall (some of which may be of questionable availability like study abroad programs), you can do typical non-college gap year activities (although availability may be worse for things like working or travel) or take courses at a regionally accredited college near home (check with Hamilton about the transferability of courses at your local community colleges or other colleges which may have space available in their courses for non-matriculated students).

38.<<<123France>>>
@ilovemybed222 , my son, who is a sophomore at Hamilton, was a Jan admit last year. He attended the London program thru Arcadia University that Hamilton offers.  Credits transfer to Hamilton, grades do not. Most Jans participate in the London program.  37/48 Jans in my son’s class did. There are pluses and minuses to the program.
I spoke recently with a parent of a student who is accepted as  a Jan for the Fall, and the London program is currently up in the air due to COVID-19.  Arcadia will make the call as to whether or not it’s a go.  The parent was a bit concerned about what her child would do should the London program get cancelled.  Some students who don’t go to London do their own thing.  I would check with Hamilton to see what their advice is for the Jans should the London program get cancelled.  This year is very unique.
If you’d like further info on being a Jan admit, you can PM me.

@123France Thank you for your offer! Unfortunately, I cannot start conversations, being a “new member.” Would you do that for me?

Having Colgate in the next town with the option of taking courses there would seem to expand the opportunities for college life experiences at Hamilton.

This might be an under-utilzed option, but I think it’s a good suggestion for a student who sees a course or two in Colgate’s catalog that offer particular appeal. At a distance of 19.1 miles (25 minutes), commuting for a class during one or two semesters at Hamilton (or from Colgate, to Hamilton) would not seem to be particularly impractical.

But is there reasonable public transportation or an inter-campus shuttle that students doing that can use?  If not, then only cyclist athletes and students with cars can reasonably make use of this option.

45.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
I am not too concerned about overlapping with Colgate, although for some, it may seem like a nice opportunity.

46.<<<gardenstategal>>>
Normally,  I would suggest that you only consider the Jan admit if you were genuinely excited about studying abroad.  If you were really looking forward to being with the rest of your class in the fall and worried about the social ramifications of the late start (not everyone is, btw), I would count that as a big negative.
But I think next fall may be odd – late start, online start – who knows?  So that could work in your favor.  You may not be missing anything except a tuition bill.  Does this make a difference to you?

47.<<<ilovemybed222>>>
@gardenstategal Thanks for saying so. Yes, I’d be excited to study abroad and wouldn’t be too worried about social life since it’d be with Jans. I don’t have faith in the program running, though – and finding another way to get the credits is tough if I don’t go. But they may roll out an online option, and that will fulfill credits and let me integrate with Jans, I believe. If I don’t study through Arcadia, then the backup plans may be less desirable due to the social detriment (or maybe not, due to COVID)…I’m trying to figure out the transfer credit options and dk what that would look like yet.
The tuition factor is something to note but not the deciding factor, fortunately.
Big question is whether or not being a Jan is a net gain…
