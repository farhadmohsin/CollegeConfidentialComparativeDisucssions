Hey guys, I don't mean to sound arrogant or cocky, but I'm incredibly lucky to be in the process of deciding which of these amazing schools I should attend. As of right now, I'm 95% sure that I'll pick Stanford, but I think I should at least consider the other two.

2.<<<gibby>>>
Congratulations -- you are blessed with a wealth of choices! The one regret both my kids have is that they spent their 4 years of college slogging through east coast winter weather instead of going someplace warmer. Just saying . . .

3.<<<fauve>>>
Great problem to have, @ potterfan ! Stanford has it's wonderful hospital and medical complex right on campus so you would have close access to lab jobs or internships. Harvard's med campus is at Longwood, in Boston, a bit of a slog by bus or subway.

Harvard has the historical edge, lots of New England architecture, beautiful autumns and springs, the East Coast preppy culture, with lots of formals with tuxes and party dresses if you like that sort of thing. Also private clubs, frats, and sororities for a minority of the population.

Check out the Life Sciences programs at Harvard (thecrimson.com) if you will need the bio classes.

Stanford provides emerald lawns, fragrant eucalyptus groves, great STEM facilities, frats and sororities, and excellent outdoor activities, bike paths, and Silicon Valley opportunities.

Will you attend Visitas, the admitted student days at Harvard? Good luck!

4.<<<renaissancedad>>>
Why are you 95% sure you will pick Stanford? Because it's been a dream of yours? That doesn't seem like a good reason, and I'm a Stanford alum and huge fan.

You are blessed with admission to 3 incredible schools. All are elite, and have incredible resources and opportunities. None is remotely like the other - 3 very, very different schools. The only thing that matters is which one is a best fit for you personally. I'd try to visit each and get a sense for where you feel you most belong.

5.<<<Penn95>>>
@potterfan You have been admitted to the three very best, most globally renowned universities in the US (and the world imo). This is quite an achievement. I feel for someone who is interested in STEM but is more of a well rounded person and still wants to explore, Stanford is the best choice. MIT might be a bit too STEM focused and intense fir some people, while Stanford is still a top notch STEM schools but is also just as good in most other areas outside of STEM. i always think of Stanford as a place combining the strengths of Harvard and MIT and at a better location. (Although Boston is great too).

You are able to choose amongst the very very top of what US higher education can offer. You can't go wrong here so go with where you thing you will fit the best, both in term of academic interests, culture, social life and overall environment. Try to research the schools as much as possible, visit the schools if possible, talk to alums etc. Also along with getting all the information needed to make an informed decision, trust you gut instinct as to which school draws you the most.

6.<<<compmom>>>
You might want to visit the campuses to make a decision. Once you are in, it is easier to get in to observe classes, even spend the night. Those events for admitted students can be useful, but sometimes it works better to visit on a regular day.

In our experience, half the students at Harvard's admitted students day were deciding between several top schools, and the other half were walking around saying things like "I have no idea why I was admitted." :) If you attend Veritas or any other similar event, you will be in good company and can discuss the schools with peers who are deciding. If you visit on another day, or are able to spend the night either way, you can discuss that particular school with those who are attending.

It's April and here in the Boston area, we woke up to snow- after many of us started putting shovels away and putting flowers out. Welcome to New England!

7.<<<potterfan>>>
@gibby how cold does it get in New England?? For some weird reason, I actually like the cold, but I've never experienced extreme temperatures.

@fauve sadly, I won't attend any visiting day. I'd have to lose tol many school days, it interferes with prom and I have other school events to attend to.

@renaissancedad no, that's not why. I got into stanford early, so I've had the pleasure of meeting amazing people and through the months, I've realized that stanford is the best fit for me, but I didn't expect to get into all these fine places, so I really wanna consider all the options.

@compmom I'm guessing your daughther goes/went to Harvard? I've heard so many negative things about it, and I'm sure all colleges have bad things, but how do you think her experience was?

Thank you for your responses.

Btw, my mom wants me to pick Harvard, my dad prefers California and my brother loves MIT, so this isn't easy!

8.<<<renaissancedad>>>
^ You say "I've realized that Stanford is the best fit for me". Why?  If that's true, then your decision should be simple, but I'm not sure why you believe that to be true. You will meet amazing people at all 3 schools. You will have amazing resources and opportunities at all 3 schools. The main issue - since finances doesn't seem to be a factor - is finding the best fit.

9.<<<Lagging>>>
Generally rankings place Stanford as the happiest of the three (and if I recall right MIT has the highest suicide rates of the three, which is probably related to the happiness level). It might sound like a silly thing to include in deciding on a school, but it's definitely worth noting. The happiness might be related to the beautiful weather of course (Seasonal Affective Disorder is more common in places with less sun).

STEM at Stanford is great and, as others have mentioned, the hospital is right on campus and there are plenty of research opportunities for premeds. I believe you can take med school classes as well (some of my friends are in a class right now where they actually get to examine and open up cadavers which sounds really exciting even to me as a non-premed, each week they work on a different body part). "Clinic" is also quite popular where students go off campus to nearby lower-income areas and assist doctors with patients.

It's also really easy to switch majors at Stanford (this might be true at Harvard and MIT as well?). You might also consider where you want to end up working. Most of the job opportunities marketed to Stanford students will be from the bay area, DC, or New York. The bulk of the opportunities will be around the San Francisco area although hundreds will be from the other areas as well. It's probably the best choice if you want to work in California. The same would probably be true of attending Harvard/MIT and working in MA.

10.<<<proudparent26>>>
Lagging "Generally rankings place Stanford as the happiest of the three" Where is your data for that? We live near Stanford and there are a lot of jerks as well nice people in the area. There is also a lot of unchill people in the area. My kid goes to Harvard and is very happy there even though it is snowing there today. STEM at Harvard is great too. The research opportunities at Harvard are great also.

Whatever choice the OP makes should be about what they feel most comfortable with.

11.<<<UNYMom>>>
I grew up in the Cambridge area, and MIT and Harvard have VERY different cultures. My husband describes it in a nutshell, "MIT students are so much smarter smarter and extremely focused on learning, but Harvard students are smoother, more well-rounded and know how to schmooze, which MIT students have no idea about." Generalizations, but lots of truth to it. The city itself has positive feelings towards students at both schools, but more negative feelings towards the administration of Harvard, which is seen as throwing its weight around much more than MIT. This is not anything that is likely to affect undergrads though. Harvard Square used to be super cool back in the day, but now that rents have gone up, it is dominated by boring shops like Panera and The Gap plus very expensive boutique stores that are out of student budget range. MIT is in a grungier part of town, and its campus is more utilitarian than Harvard's. There are many more cheap ethnic restaurants near MIT. The two schools are very close to one another, though, and it is easy to walk or take the bus between both parts of town. Harvard is much more akin to Stanford in culture than MIT is.

12.<<<renaissancedad>>>
^ "Harvard is much more akin to Stanford in culture than MIT is."

I don't understand this at all. I wonder if you have actual experience, or are just talking in generalizations. Having attended both, they are dramatically different. I'd say Stanford has at least as much in common with MIT as it does with Harvard, but its an entirely different environment from either.

13.<<<proudparent26>>>
@renaissancedad Have you ever been to the Stanford shopping mall or eaten in downtown Palo Alto ? I think the closest thing to it in terms of culture is Beverly Hills.

14.<<<renaissancedad>>>
^ I went to Stanford. But your statement is a gross oversimplification. The Stanford mall is no different from the Chestnut Hill mall, aside from the weather.

15.<<<bluewater2015>>>
proudparent26, I will grant you that Palo Alto has its fair share of entitled people these days, but with regard to the happiness of undergraduates (post #9), here is one piece of data consistent with what Lagging said.

This is from a book called The Alumni Factor which surveys alumni of various schools. Here are rankings among national universities on whether alums would personally choose to go to their school again, based on their experiences.
-Stanford #7
-MIT #34
-Harvard #40

That's not to say the OP should necessarily chose Stanford but it is data on the point of overall student happiness.

16.<<<danstearns>>>
Article in the Stanford Daily talks about how it feels to be unhappy in a place where you're expected to be happy.
<url>http://www.stanforddaily.com/2013/01/18/the-pressure-to-be-happy-and-the-crisis-of-the-humanities/</url>

17.<<<compmom>>>
Data from alumni/ae may not be pertinent since Drew Faust has instituted some changes and in recent years Harvard has had more focus on the undergrad experience, including more opportunities in applied arts, renovations of dorms, and more common spaces.

18.<<<potterfan>>>
Guys I'm really grateful for all of your insights. I think at this point I've narrowed it to Stanford and MIT. I must say that I'm a little underwhelmed at Stanford, though. Since I got in, I have received maybe 3 emails from them; it's almost as if they didn't want me...

Anyway, between S and M, which one has a better STEM department?? Which one is better for a posdible premed choice??

19.<<<maiphuong>>>
@potterfan If you cling to STEM, then pick MIT.

20.<<<Penn95>>>
@potterfan I don't think the interest the school shows is an accurate criterion for your choice especially since Stanford is the most popular school nowadays. I am guessing the reason that MIT has shown more interest is that they know that you will have other top choices and they also know that quite a few admits have reservations about attending MIT due to its being way more rigorous and intense than Harvard, Stanford etc ( they are afraid it is going to be too much for them).

A key consideration for pre med is that MIT is way more rigorous and has more grade deflation than Stanford. For medical school you need as high a GPA as possible. Also of course in terms of overall STEM, MIT is at the very top but Stanford is just right behind it.

I just feel you will get a more well rounded but essentially as good technical education at Stanford relative to MIT. In any m case both excellent choices we re splitting hair here.

21.<<<HisTyNess>>>
MIT basically invented STEM!!! Go there!

But after reading this entire thread there IS something you're not looking at that is SUPER important.
That is worldwide (not national) reputation.

As someone who's well educated and works nationally (NYC) and abroad (London) here's what you may hear when you mention these two schools:

Stanford = "Oh Great school! I hear the weather there is nice in California!"
MIT = "OMG!! You went to MIT?!?! Wow thats incredible! You must be some sort of genius!!"

22.<<<potterfan>>>
I'm not gonna choose a college based on that... Most people don't even know that Stanford is more competitive than Harvard.

23.<<<Penn95>>>
@HisTYNess @potterfan In terms of international reputation and prominence the three U.S. schools at the very top are Harvard, MIT, Stanford so you are not sacrificing that by choosing one vs the other.

24.<<<danstearns>>>
[quote]In terms of international reputation and prominence the three U.S. schools at the very top are Harvard, MIT, Stanford so you are not sacrificing that by choosing one vs the other.[/quote]

There was a time, not too many years ago, that Yale would have been right there as well.

25.<<<Penn95>>>
@danstearns Yale definitely isnt right there now (it is just a notch below) and I dont think it was before either. The simple reason for that is that Yale s graduate schools as a whole are not as strong as H/S/MIT and Yale is not a research powerhouse to the level that the aforementioned 3 schools are. The combination of prestige (mainly grad school) + being a research powerhouse is what detrmines global perception.
Yale has always been (and prob will always be) slightly overshadowed by Harvard, while MIT and Stanford have broken out of Harvard's shadow because they offer completely different things and are leaders in fields where Harvard is relatively lacking. As someone who has lived most of his life outside the US and in various places (Europe, Asia, Africa), my experience has been that the US schools perceived as the very best, most prominent have historically been Harvard, MIT and Stanford has joined them in the last 15-20 years. Yale and Princeton are right behind these 3 but not on the same level exactly.

26.<<<potterfan>>>
I think I'm gonna pick Stanford, but for some reason, I still can't commit.

27.<<<ewho>>>
Majors+location +30 years.

The name of any of the three will bear what you have achieved today. If you are strong enough, you should not care where you go.

28.<<<Planner>>>
@proudparent26 The culture of the Stanford Shopping Center and downtown Palo Alto has nothing in common with that of Beverly Hills, though some of the mall's stores may be just as high end. I live in Southern California and lived in Palo Alto for many years (and have visited frequently for years) and am familiar with both "cultures," though I'm not part of either myself. I also worked in Cambridge for a couple of years. I think it's important to distinguish between Stanford the university and its surrounding area. Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and other towns have changed enormously with the growth of Silicon Valleyin my opinion, for the worse. They're now unaffordable for anyone who didn't buy there decades ago or is extremely wealthy now. Cambridge too has changedit's become oppressively congested and costs a bundle to live there these days, and many of the stores and restaurants around Harvard Square are just as expensive as their counterparts in the Stanford Shopping Center.

In any case, though, Stanford University isn't part of the Stanford Shopping Center and downtown Palo Alto, and its students don't frequent them all that oftenjust as most Harvard students aren't likely to regularly patronize the extremely expensive shopping and dining (and parking!) options nearby. Both Stanford and Harvard are diverse environments, with a broad spectrum of students and faculty pursuing their academic and vocational passions, not spending their limited time and money shopping at outrageously expensive stores or dining in restaurants likely to set back their budgets for months. That's a lot different from the stereotypical shoppers and diners in Beverly Hills (many of whom, by the way, are tourists).

29.<<<3girls3cats>>>
@planner, I live not too far from Stanford and have a kid at Harvard. From what that kid tells me, the Harvard kids <i> do </i> spend a lot of their time exploring the eateries and shops in Harvard Square. Harvard is an urban school. Stanford is not. That's neither a pro nor a con but it's a real difference.

OP, I honestly would not put much stock in the myths that get circulated on CC. I think I fell prey to that and was desperately worried about how my daughter would fare in the cold, uncaring, competitive, snooty environment of Harvard. It's been a fantastic year for her and I wish I hadn't paid so much attention. She's met great kids and professors too, she's more relaxed than she was in high school, she <i> loves </i> being in an environment where she can walk or T to so many attractions. There are opportunities and diversions everywhere, on campus and off. And Stanford, as gorgeous and wonderful as it is, is not immune to the same pressures of competition and elitism. I can't urge you strongly enough to form your own impressions and believe in them. The great thing is that you can't go wrong with either choice.

Interestingly, the CA kids we know who were admitted to both schools unanimously chose Harvard. I can see the opposite happening with the non-California kids. It's healthy for people to experience different environments. Just don't be put off by non-issues.

30.<<<Planner>>>
@3girls3cats I agree that Stanford isn't an urban schoolit's suburban (though it still has access to urban environments, albeit at some distance).

I personally know of two California kids (my son one of them) who chose Stanford over Harvard. Another California kid I know chose MIT over both Stanford and Harvard. I myself don't know any California kids who chose Harvard over Stanford, but I know they exist, and I'm guessing in higher percentages than the reverse, just because "Harvard is Harvard" and, for students here, Harvard is a more novel environment.

31.<<<proudparent26>>>
@planner My kid chose Harvard over Stanford and one of their best friends from HS chose Yale over Stanford. So now you know one

32.<<<Planner>>>
@proudparent26 My point was that many students choose Harvard over Stanford, probably more percentage-wise than the reverse, but that I personally didn't know anythe few I know chose Stanford or MIT. Just like the students @3girls3cats knows who chose Harvard. We're all speaking of the students we know, not ones we've heard about elsewhere or on College Confidential. It really doesn't matter, anywayboth schools are great, and each will appeal to different students (and parents). It seems pointless, though, to continue equating Palo Alto with places like Beverly Hills and implying that the relative wealth of Silicon Valley is something most Stanford students are involved with on a daily basis. They're notthey're just busy studying, working hard on campus at part-time jobs, and trying to survive. They're not going on shopping sprees at the Stanford Shopping Center or on University Ave.

33.<<<proudparent26>>>
@planner I don't disagree with much of what you say. However the relative wealth of Silicon Valley and Stanford just like the relative wealth of Harvard has an effect on these kids. Right now I am sure whether it is good or bad

34.<<<yawninglion>>>
@potterfan Congrats!!!!
I am a junior this year and I'm trying to collect as much info as I can. Do you mind sharing your standardized scores, GPA, and other stats if you feel comfortable sharing? Thanks!

35.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
@Lagging: The suicide rate at MIT has in no way been attributed to a happiness/unhappiness factor among its students, and has recently been understood to be attributable to areas of student and faculty life that are not constrained to, if even related to, the courseload or course-related stress.

36.<<<Lagging>>>
@Waiting2exhale Either way, I think the point still stands that a higher than average suicide rate is something to consider.

37.<<<danstearns>>>
@Lagging, I think only 12 schools provided that data for the study you're referencing. Stanford, I believe, declined. Still, this is from an article in the Stanford Daily,

"This has created a crisis: CAPS (Vadens psychological services wing) is so flooded with demand that it cant adequately accommodate the number of students seeking its services. When two student suicides occurred last year, there was silence on the part of the administration  not even a candlelit vigil in White Plaza. Are we afraid of what would happen to us if we voice our sadness and our confusion, or even worse, our grief?"

The illusion of a utopian campus is nothing more than a carefully constructed marketing plan.

38.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
@Lagging:

Yes, and I've PM'ed parents and written in threads about the way MIT has handled these matters as of late, meaning how it has sought to identify contributing factors (where this is even possible), and how it has engaged the student and parent community - informing both of the counseling and support services available, the increase and establishment of offices and office hours for counseling, and seeking input from all corners on how best to support our students.

The larger point on stress is not to be overlooked, and I think we would not find ourselves in any disagreement on that issue. Stress is a concern for kids on every college campus, as it is during this undergraduate/graduate phase in our lives when mental illness can present itself, seemingly derailing the hopes and dreams of everyone involved. I do not think we disagree at all on this.

The happiness point was one I sought to address here, however.

39.<<<proudparent26>>>
"The illusion of a utopian campus is nothing more than a carefully constructed marketing plan"


I agree

40.<<<Planner>>>
I do too, for all these schools. That's why looking at the specific attributes and offerings of each school is so important. They all want you to apply (and, if you're chosen, matriculate), and I can't think of a single school whose brochures, websites, etc., don't make it sound idyllic. No place is paradise.

41.<<<SouthernHope>>>
I don't mean to be pushy...and I get that prom is important...but I would absolutely go visit Harvard and MIT before you make this decision...they're 15 mins away from each other...and you've been handed the opportunity of an academic dream....please please visit!

@yawninglion My stats are on the Stanford EA thread.

43.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford is the most complete university in the world. Harvard lacks Stanford's engineering and tech.. MIT lacks Stanford's arts and humanities. Stanford tops all universities in selectivity and annual fund raising.. has won more nobel prizes this century than any university or institute in the world. You can't go wrong with MIT or Harvard .. if engineering and you prefer the east coast.. MIT.. if more humanities.. medicine go Harvard.

44.<<<proudparent26>>>
Harvard is the most well rounded university. It has the largest endowment.  For the pure sciences Harvard is the bes. Stanford is much more bro centric than Harvard. Harvard doesnt put out lists of easy classes for its athletes and bros

45.<<<sbballer>>>
lols... Stanford leads in many metrics and is the university of the future.. Harvard is playing catch up along with the rest of the ivies.. that's reality

46.<<<Penn95>>>
@proudparent26 Harvard is definitely not the most well-rounded university in the world. If there is any university that truly deserves that title then this is Stanford. It is super strong in virtually every single field which cannot be said about Harvard (or any other university really). Stanford is essentially a combination of Harvard &amp; MIT.
What does bro-centric even mean? I don't understand the point you are trying to make with the whole easy classes thing.

47.<<<potterfan>>>
I agree that Stanford is the most well-rounded. I also really love Stanford's athletic department. They actually compete and win titles, which can't be said about Harvard and MIT.

Stanford is on the quarter system versus the semester system for Harvard and MIT. This can have an impact on summer plans as well as course selections. Harvard does not really have any major greek life whereas Stanford does.

Some people at Stanford are not all that happy with greek life. I am sure there are some people who are very happy with it.

You should definitely visit them to take them all in: you cannot truly comprehend the sights, aromas, sounds, and vibe of a place without being there.

These are all great schools, part of the HYPSM quintet (I might add Wiliams, Columbia and UChicago to make it an octet, but that's me...), so prestige and opportunities are not really an issue, are they?

So how are they really different?

- Weather: Four seasons vs. one
- Social scene
- Culture and vibe
- Environment: urban vs. suburban
- Dorm arrangements/traditions
- Ease of access to public transit and closeness to stuff
- Academic differences:
1. If you are unsure about your major, Harvard and Stanford likely hold a slight edge -- they're good in pretty much everything. But if you are certain that you want to go into STEM, I would give a slight edge to MIT. (unless you must become a CS entrepreneur in Silicon Valley...)
2. Check to see which school has the highest percentage of undergrads (as part of total student population): you want profs, deans and staff to pay as much attention as possible to the undergrads, so the lower the percentage of grad students, the better. Bonus points to that school.
3. Also check to see which school has the fewest TA-led discussions and labs. Bonus points to that school.
4. I do think class size and prof availability matter, so check on those things too.

As long as you pick the school that fits you best academically and in the other aforementioned ways, you cannot go wrong.

51.<<<T26E4>>>
A social aspect to consider is the House system at Harvard which engenders some pretty strong loyalty. At Stanford and MIT, people move from place to place like most other universities. Often the options for long lasting social bonds are supplanted by schools' Greek systems.

My GF at Stanford was pretty much a nomad year to year and didn't form strong ties like I did at Yale (whose Residential College system is similar to Harvard's House system). This isn't to say she didn't get a fantastic education -- she certainly did. But socially, I wouldn't have traded my situation for hers at all.

When I made the decision between Harvard and Stanford, the final tipping point was the values of the university. I preferred that Harvard did not privilege athletes over other students making contributions to the university. I also preferred that Harvard established a 100% inclusive housing system that eliminated self-segregation by race, social clubs, politics, etc. Students never decide whether other students get the housing they want. These aren't objectively the RIGHT philosophies -- they are just HANNA philosophies. That's what making the right match is all about.

54.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
I'm looking through the Stanford Housing stuff this week, and it is a labyrinthine mess. One thing that had not jumped out at me in a cautionary sense, but rather one which might be fairly uniform and less than radical as I assume it happens this way at many universities, is the way decisions are made about who lives in what house.

In all the talk we've had here at CC about self-segregation on campuses, I guess I had not read into that process and selection method as anything akin to something so stark as segregation. But I'll sit and think on it.

This is a very timely conversation, of course, and helps me greatly to guide my daughter.

55.<<<Hanna>>>
The other way to look at it is that Stanford gives students more choice, which is true. Within official housing, there are ethnic theme houses that largely attract members of those ethnic groups, crunchy co-ops that largely attract hippies, frat houses where the frat guys live, etc. From my point of view, even if you want to live in general interest housing, you don't get a cross-section of the population because many groups have separated themselves.

56.<<<sbballer>>>
not sure what is meant by privileged over other students.. other than having some Olympic athletes in your dorm I didn't see much if any privilege. they were like any other students on campus. Stanford athletics competes at the most elite level of the NCAA and has been the top athletic program in the country for the past 20 years. Harvard does not.

that being said Harvard like most universities (and Stanford more so) with the exception of Caltech lowers its academic standards for athletics. basketball and football are prime examples.

it's a matter of degree... Stanford is at one end of the spectrum and competes in a FBS power conference against the likes of UCLA and USC... with Caltech at the other. Harvard is somewhere in between.

57.<<<proudparent26>>>
IMO Harvard is at an advantage for not having top notch athletics for which they have to lower their standards

58.<<<sbballer>>>
Harvard does lower academic standards for athletics... less so but don't kid yourself.. the SATs for the Harvard b ball team is lower than the average. Caltech does not.

59.<<<Hanna>>>
"not sure what is meant by privileged over other students"

The non-need-based $240,000 scholarships? That's what I mean. The ones that aren't available for students with non-athletic talents even if they are singing leads at the Met.

60.<<<sbballer>>>
that's more a function of Pac 12 vs ivy league. Pac 12 and power conferences give out athletic scholarships.

61.<<<Hanna>>>
Yes. Stanford makes the choice to be in the Pac 12. They could do whatever they wanted. Harvard chooses not to. UChicago used to be in the Big 10 and decided to leave to keep sports from overshadowing academics. These are the values and philosophies I'm talking about.

62.<<<Penn95>>>
i don't think having strong athletics takes anything away from the other parts of the Stanford experience. It just makes for a more vibrant and fun atmosphere. It is pretty amazing that a school so strong academically is also so strong in athletics. It just goes back to the point that Stanford is the most well-rounded school out there.

63.<<<sbballer>>>
yes and that's more a function of ivy league vs a power conference that gives out athletic scholarships. I see it as a major plus for Stanford and Berkeley.. it adds to the diversity of the student body with student athletes that compete at the most elite level along with excellence in all academic disciplines. to each his or her own.

64.<<<danstearns>>>
The model espoused by Stanford, UMIch and Notre Dame creates a duality - there are the students and there are the gladiators hired to wear the team colors. The two seldom meet. To each his own.

65.<<<sbballer>>>
at Stanford they meet...

love him or hate him Richard Sherman came straight out of Compton.. graduated second in his class. Dad was a former gang member. Richard was admitted to Stanford on an athletic scholarship. Yes his SATS were most likely below the Stanford average yet he demonstrated academic excellence in admittedly a challenging environment. it's a matter of perspective

66.<<<potterfan>>>
You all have very fair points. As of now, I'm leaning toward Stanford.

Pros of Stanford
-The campus
-Athletics (so many Olympic athletes)
-Creativity and innovation
-School pride
-Traditions
-Internationally renown
-The weather
-All around amazing

Cons of Stanford
-I'm not a fan of the housing
-Not a semester system
-One weather year long

Pros of Harvard
-The campus
-The east coast
-The housing system
-4 different seasons
-Internationally renown

Cons of Harvard
-The atmosphere
-Not good athletically
-I could be wrong, but people seem very pretentious


I will visit Harvard next week and I'll fly to California for Stanford's admit days. It;s really frustrating that Stanford visiting days are literally a day before the decision deadline, though.

I think Stanford housing in freshmen dorms was great. They have houses of 90+ and 8 houses per residence complex. D in final year still keeps up with many of the first year dorm mates now scattered all over campus. After 1st year they can choose anyone for a room mate for the next 4 years. What is interesting is that all form friendships where they are able to attend senior year parties of each dorm as the one allowed guest of one of their friends in that dorm. It is ridiculous how many parties they have been going to though.

72.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
@texaspg: For the next 4 years? Wow.

So the answer to a question I was posing,

<i>Tell me, what was the impact of the freshman year housing option, where so many of the kids are actually not in one of the larger group housings but in, say, FroSoCo or SLE? Did your child(ren) sense a distinct air of 'I don't need to make friends with someone who is not in my house?'</i>

is answered with 'D in final year still keeps up with many of the first year dorm mates now scattered all over campus'? And, ' ...all form friendships where they are able to attend senior year parties of each dorm as the one allowed guest of one of their friends in that dorm'?

"Oh, Hanna, your comments are the peas under the mattress today (for which I thank you)."

So I'm bruising you while you sleep? (Genuinely confused.)

74.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
No, the sensitive soul that I am, I am mulling over your words quite deeply, and not exactly as assured as I seek to be at this point in the game.

It is not my decision to make, choosing a college, but I also want to feel that I have sufficient information going in.

(The reference is from some tale told to children. Looked it up, The Princess and The Pea by Hans Christian Andersen.)

At the end of the day, @potterfan, you'll end up at a great school. 20 years from now if you're at a social event and someone asks where you went to school, you'll say "Stanford", and your spouse will chime in, "but he also was accepted to Harvard."

76.<<<potterfan>>>
@danstearns That's really sweet. I'm a girl, btw. I'll then add: "but only God knows how I got in, though"

77.<<<texaspg>>>
@waitingtoexhale - I have no idea what you are asking. I noticed cons from OP in post #65.

I don't really know what your interests are in this thread. If your D is admitted to Stanford and you have questions, you should start a separate thread.

78.<<<Hanna>>>
"It is not my decision to make, choosing a college, but I also want to feel that I have sufficient information going in."

Well, there's hardly a way to go wrong here! Talk about a win-win.

79.<<<SocalPapa>>>
My D considered both Stanford and Harvard (and other colleges), but made her decision in advance (after visiting campuses, sitting in classes, etc) and chose to apply to Stanford Restrictive Early Action. She was admitted and more than delighted to accept her place in the class of 2020. Given her resume she had at least a chance of being admitted to more than one top college, but she had no interest in applying anywhere just to get in. She was all in on Stanford from the beginning and thankfully it worked out.

You never know what might make a difference for someone in choosing a college. For example, Stanford and Harvard both have freshmen seminars that involve the opportunity to interact with senior faculty in a small group setting (typically 12 students). But Harvard's seminars are ungraded discussion sessions while Stanford offers the seminars as full academic classes. The preference for one or the other is strictly personal. One student may prefer the idea of being able to interact with senior faculty without the pressure of graded papers and exams. Another may prefer an interaction that involves the complete educational experience, including feedback on one's academic work. My D happened to fit in the later category.

As others have suggested, you can't go wrong in your choice (at least in terms of the reputation of the two universities). But if you take the time to really dig into the differences between the two schools you should be able to figure out which one is best for you.

There are some die hard Stanford Posters on this site. They claim that Stanford helped start the silicon valley and is responsible for its success. However a lot of criticism has been heaped upon silicon valley both in regards to its blatant gender discrimination and racial discrimination. The may of Oakland said "when will tech look like America". Silicon Valley has been referred to as a bro culture and a big frat party.

<url>http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/01/09/wolves-tech-street-how-silicon-valleys-bro-culture-hurts-us-all</url>.

I have known a number of kids who didn't want to go to Stanford because of this attitude they thought was prevalent at Stanford. I looked at the tenured faculty in CS at Stanford and noticed only a couple were women. I wonder to what extent Stanford is responsible for the bro culture in SV and what some of the fervent supporters of Stanford think of that

81.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford is also a leader in graduating women CS majors

82.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
@texaspg:

Many aspects of student life at Stanford, those both known and assumed, are being discussed here. I seek to benefit from, and expand, the discussion, taking from one of the points already open in the thread.

83.<<<texaspg>>>
Moderator's note

@waitng2exhale - It is customary to respond to an OP's questions when they are searching for answers in order to help them make their decisions. When others start asking questions, moderators usually spin them off into their own thread in order to keep them separate.

84.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
I have noticed that spin-off to be most consistent when the additional comments are far from tangential, or intended to inflame. But, so noted.

85.<<<sbballer>>>
Speaking of bro culture it seems to be a tradition indoctrinated on the Harvard campus with its final clubs.

<url>http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/3/9/report-lambasts-final-clubs/</url>

86.<<<proudparent26>>>
The original OP asked about stem and the culture at the universities. Google which was founded by two Stanford graduates has 16 per cent women and 2 per cent Hispanics and 1 per cent blacks. Most of the other tech companies have similar demographics in the SV. California is a state that demographically is almost 50 per cent black and Hispanic. If the OP is a woman or a minority they may want to factor that into their decision equation about which school to pick

87.<<<sbballer>>>
interesting logic.. Facebook founded by a Harvard graduate has similar demographics.. but that doesn't fit your narrative of course.

88.<<<JHS>>>
Wow, is this petty.

By the way, the founders of Google did not receive bachelors degrees from Stanford (they were graduate students there), and the founder of Facebook did not graduate from Harvard (after two years there, he was too wrapped up turning Facebook into a business to return to college).

The notion that Stanford is somehow a bad place for women is ludicrous. Some of the strongest feminist scholarship in the country has happened there. Whatever you think of the university's commitment to high-level athletics, no one can claim that it has not supported women's athletics as strongly as it supports men's athletics.

Another inaccuracy: Stanford does not have just one season. It really has three: rainy, spring, and dry. I have never experienced so sharp a transformation from winter (rainy) to spring as I did in Palo Alto. It was like someone flicked a switch, and everything bloomed.

Harvard and Stanford are probably the two strongest universities on the planet right now, and there are myriad reasons to choose either of them for undergraduate education vs. the other (just as there are myriad reasons to choose a handful of other colleges over either of them, depending on the personality and goals of the chooser). It really isn't a right-answer/wrong-answer question, as many people have pointed out. Flipping a coin would ensure a good result, as would any other method of deciding.

89.<<<3girls3cats>>>
I feel bad for anyone looking for real answers. There are differences between the two schools but the suggestions that one is better than the other is silly. One might be better for one person, the other might be better for a different person. It depends on variances in personality, course of study, location. Urban vs suburban, different housing systems, quarter vs semester, Greek vs mostly not Greek, sports culture vs not very sporty, northeast vs west---those are real differences and it is a personal decision how those issues factor in. But the suggestion that one is cutthroat and unfriendly while the other is sunshine and roses is, again, silly. You will find good people and great opportunities at both places. This is a win-win choice with no bad outcome!

90.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
Wow, @proudparent, that is absolutely ridiculous.

91.<<<potterfan>>>
I'm currently visiting Harvard and I'm not really into it... I don't know if I should feel bad about it.

92.<<<3girls3cats>>>
@potterfan, I think you were mentally signed onto Stanford from the start. Don't feel bad about it, just listen to your heart.

93.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
@pottterfan: Remember to look at everything and experience each interaction with your whole, open heart. If it is not right for you, and 3girls3cats is correct, then there is no reason to feel bad at all.

Ask yourself what Harvard would have to have, or be, to make it right for you. If the answer is 'it would be perfect if were moved to the West coast,' then that tells you the university may have many things to offer you.

Just be fully open. Good luck to you.

94.<<<renaissancedad>>>
@potterfan, why should you feel bad about it? Harvard's an amazing, wonderful school, but that doesn't mean that it's the best place for everyone. Your reaction should help bring you clarity and resolution, not leave you feeling guilty.

95.<<<potterfan>>>
I didn't think I could love this place more than I already did, but I was so wrong.

96.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
@potterfan: Sounds like You're Home.

Congrats on making your choice.

97.<<<potterfan>>>
i just came home and it's official, Stanford class of 2020! I'm so excited to finally call this place home for the next 4 years

I'll admit I'm a little sad because Harvard's obviously a great place, but Stanford's an even better place imo. I wish I didn't have to turn any of my choices down, but c'est la vie.

Finally, thank you SO MUCH to everyone on this board who helped me and guided me when I was lost. This process would've been way worse without you guys. I hope I can guide someone as you've guided me and hopefully I'll meet new trees along the CC way.

98.<<<sbballer>>>
Fear the Tree:)

99.<<<renaissancedad>>>
^^ Both are great schools, it's just a matter of which is a better fit for you at this time. Undergrad is not the end of your life, either. I turned Harvard down for Stanford undergrad, and I turned Stanford down for Harvard for med school. Having to choose between great options is a blessing.

Good luck!

100.<<<Waiting2exhale>>>
@sbballer: Fear the Frosh!

101.<<<Redtor>>>
If OP was serious about getting into med school someday, he should not have ruled out Harvard completely. Harvard is the number one feeder school to the top 10 medical schools across the US. MIT has had a poor ranking in this area.

102.<<<potterfan>>>
^^ I'm not going to MIT. I think Stanford is just as strong as Harvard in the premed field.

103.<<<texaspg>>>
@potterfan - congratulations on being able to make a decision.

If you have questions about premed at Stanford or how to pick classes, PM me.

104.<<<ewho>>>
@potterfan, Congrats! I did not want to write too much to influence you.

You should be fine at Stanford for whatever major(s) you want to choose. My son was Phi Beta Kappa graduate and recruited by Google upon graduation, and got in Stanford's GSB (Graduate School of Business) by just randomly applying there. Last quarter he even got an email from the Dean of GSB to praise his grades. What I mean is that Stanford's education is as good as any school, and the choices are so many. Majors+location+20 years from now is what you focus on.

105.<<<Hanna>>>
Congratulations! Have a wonderful time.
