Hey everyone,

2.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
WoW! what a decision. I think it would be very difficult for anyone to decline an Ivy league school, especially Yale! Congrats on your acceptance. You can't go wrong on either school, its just where you think you "fit" the best. Notre Dame is an awesome school, and you wouldn't be alone to reject an Ivy league to attend. Actually, I believe Shellzie rejected Dartmouth to come to ND... i hope thats right?

anyway, I dont think you could go wrong with either school



good luck

3.<<<MallomarCookie>>>
You should go to the school where you feel at home. But dude, Yale!?

4.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Screw the Ivy leauge. Although Cornell is no Yale, I turned it down.

5.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
A lot of people in Ivy League schools are there just for the prestige factor but have no love of the particular school in question. The result is that the students lack the ND panache. Besides, you're not sacrificing academic quality if you come here. We sometimes turn down perfect SAT folks just like ivy league schools do and have our share of NMF's, olympiad winners, etc. ND is the ultimate college experience.

6.<<<irish68178>>>
Shellzie is great at answering these questions and I am sure she will be here soon, but if not, we went over a lot of these issues (including Yale specifically) here <url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/showthread.php?t=323066</url>.

Both schools are top 20 schools and have great reputations. Applying to graduate school really helped me appreciate how big the ND name is and how many opportunities I had here!

At the end of the day, you have to go where you think you fit best and where you will be happiest (I think at least). I believe if you do that you will thrive because you are in the proper environment for you to succeed. You can go to the best school in the world, but if you hate it there, you are not going to fulfill your potential.

ND has a very special mix of faith, athletics, and academics. I don't think you will find those anywhere else. If that appeals to you, I think you should come here. If you are more academics and the others don't matter, perhaps not (not to say ND isn't strong in academics, but it seems that academics are more of an integral part of your life at Ivy Leagues instead of it being a part with athletics and faith, you know?)

Anyway, I hope that helps some. If you let us know what is important to you, and what you are looking for in a school, I hope we can help you more with this decision!

7.<<<PrincessND>>>
Hi Giggidy,
Come to ND! I turned down Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Stanford, Berkeley and Michigan for ND. It's the best, hands down. :) Maybe I'm a little biased though. ;)

8.<<<nutmeg88>>>
Of all my college visits I felt the most at home at Yale. Boy, what wouldn't I give to have one of those fat letters.

Anyway, it seems like you are leaning towards ND. Go to ND if you really love it that much.

9.<<<irish68178>>>
You have to go where you fit best, regardless of where that is. That is part of the reason I will be receiving my PhD from West Virginia University

10.<<<giggidy333>>>
Thanks for all the responses guys! The three most important things for me in my college decision are academics (specifically humanities), music (specifically choir), and faith (specifically Catholocism). Now, with its Directed Studies Program and a cappella groups, Yale has a significant advantage in the academics and music categories. I've never sat in on a PLS class at Notre Dame, though, so if anyone could share anything about what that's like it would be much appreciated. Obviously, although about 25% of Yale is Catholic (so I've heard), Notre Dame has the edge as far as faith is concerned. Based these factors alone, my "head" would choose Yale. However, I visited Yale and I just didn't get the feeling at Yale that I did at Notre Dame. Granted it was rainy and cold at Yale when I visited and sunny and warm at Notre Dame, so that might have played a role in my "gut feeling." Almost everyone I've talked to has said to go with your gut feeling, but it seems to me that, economically speaking, a Yale degree may be more financially beneficial in the future, especially since Yale will be about $3000 a year cheaper to go to due to a better financial aid package. I want to go on to get either an MBA or a JD, so the effect that the reputation of my undergraduate institution, as well as the difficulty to get a rather high GPA there, are also factors in my decision. Wow, that was lengthy... Thanks again for both your past and (hopefully) future help!

11.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Well if you want to do busniess...Mendoza was ranked as high as no.3

12.<<<posterX>>>
Yale has a much better reputation, academically and reputation wise. Looking at the available statistics, classes at Yale are significantly smaller, students are significantly more intelligent and creative, a much larger (20 times more) number of alumni at Yale go onto the top graduate schools or become leaders in their fields, and the departments at Yale are more highly regarded in virtually every area of study -- in particular, the areas you mentioned in your post.

For what it's worth, here's a list of the top 100 universities in the world. Yale is #3 in the world. Notre Dame doesn't make the top 100.

<url>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/</url>

Another ranking (SJTU) has Notre Dame ranked somewhere between #200 and #300 -- a very far cry from Yale, and far below places like the University of Connecticut, University of Buenos Aires, University of Cincinnati, Virginia Tech, and Virginia Commonwealth University.

13.<<<notredamebrother>>>
My sister was in the exact situation. From my screen name you can probally guess where she went :)

14.<<<danbrenn>>>
PosterX, I do agree with you that academically Yale has ND beat, but the rankings you posted were for the top 100 global universities. The article defines a global university as one the embraces diversity and international culture. ND is ranked so low in the article because of its fairly uniform catholic student body, and not because it is a horrible university.

15.<<<giggidy333>>>
Notredamebrother, is your sister happy with her choice? Does she ever regret not going to Yale? Also, was money a factor in her decision? Thanks a lot for all your feedback guys.

16.<<<jags861>>>
danbrenn,

posterx could have pulled any rankings and found that yale is going to be ranked higher. I don't think it really matters which one he choose. IMO, there are some schools you don't turn down unless you have an equal school. IMO, the only schools really "equal" to Yale in name brand value are HPS.

17.<<<irish68178>>>
You guys are awfully quick to write-off Notre Dame academically. This is a top 20 school guys! Yes, there are rankings out there that has Notre Dame lower, I understand that, but at the end of the day you can get a great education at either school, it is more a question of fit than anything. I guarantee you I could have gone to Yale and wouldn't have gotten a better education because this is where I fit and I took advantage of every opportunity I got here.

Personally, as discussed in another thread, I think ND is underrated and I don't put a lot of faith in rankings. It seems that ND gets marked down a bit because our grad school is admittedly weak, but we are working on that and it is the undergraduate school that counts.

Yale has more prestige, and if that is very important to you, go there, because you won't be happy here. ND is a great school for those who value what we are about and what we bring to the table. If you want a school that supports you from the time you step on campus until the day you die, where you are truly part of a family and you never truly graduate, and a place where you will be strengthened not just academically but also spiritually, I think ND is the place for you. It all depends on your priorities.

Also, I seriously question those MSNBC rankings, as I think any logical person would after having looked at them. Just because rankings are published doesn't mean they are valid!

18.<<<irish68178>>>

Given that I live right down the hall from someone that turned down Harvard for ND, I don't think that is true. Again, these are both top 20 schools, you are going to do well regardless. It is all about where you feel you fit best.  This is four years of your life, you don't want to go to a school that is well-respected but you hate! Life is too short

19.<<<jags861>>>
i'm not saying people don't choose ND over other schools--of course it happens. its my personal opinion, that if i was choosing between yale and nd, i'd choose yale. i've said it on the UVa board...I love UVa. But don't think for a second that if 3 years ago I had acceptance letters from Yale and UVa in front of me I'd be at UVa right now. like i said, I think HYPS are the 4 premier schools in this country whose names are better names than any other school in the country.

i'd answer the same way to this question regarding practically any school.

20.<<<danceluvur26>>>
Maybe if you are having a hard time, if you get a chance you could try to visit the schools again (since you said that it was rainy when you visited Yale, while sunny when @ ND) But honestly, both schools are amazing (I would die to go to either) so you can't go wrong whichever you pick. If your gut feeling is leaning towards ND then definately follow it. Also, if you are planning on going to grad school then undergrad doesn't really matter all that much (obviously your grades and such matter, but the prestige of the school doesn't matter as much) so if you are worried about ND not having as much prestige (which it does have a good amount of... just not quite as much as Yale) you can always go to an even more prestigious grad school.

To make the above long story short, from what you've stated in your posts, I think that you should go to ND.

21.<<<shellzie2006>>>
Check out the other thread for a more in-depth response, but I'll add a few thoughts here. Yale does have an academic edge and a better reputation, but Notre Dame has an amazing network of alumni and some very highly ranked departments. Also, I wouldn't say that the academic difference between the two is what it is made out to be. Don't pay too much attention to the international rankings either. I've looked at some of those before and the University of Minnesota was ranked above Dartmouth... So, for academics, I'd say you can't really go wrong. As for music, I can't tell you a whole lot. I have a lot of friends who sing in the choirs here, but it does seem like the majority of musical opportunities are religious choirs, etc. As for your last factor- there is absolutely no way you can beat Notre Dame. Yale might be 25% Catholic, but I bet you anything very few of them are practicing. I have friends at Yale and some of their stories are almost scary. The social atmosphere there is definitely more liberal (not just politically, but on the things that the student body embraces or that the administration lets slide). If you are looking for a spiritual aspect to college life, you really can't beat Notre Dame.

I did turn down Dartmouth and Amherst to come here (money was not a factor), and I know people who turned down offers from places like Harvard and Caltech. I have never regretted my choice. You can get a good education at all of the above, but there really is no substitute for Notre Dame.

22.<<<irish68178>>>
Amen Shellzie!

23.<<<posterX>>>
That's not true, danbrenn. The Newsweek Global University Rankings are only partly based on diversity and international culture. Mostly they are based on academic quality. Also, A) any other ranking would show the same thing and B) the gap between being in the top few and being ranked 200th is pretty huge.

Also, the ability to attract a large number of top international scholars, as anyone who has attended a truly "global" university in the United States or abroad would immediately attest, is partly a marker of academic excellence and definitely one of the attractive things about studying in such an environment. ND simply doesn't have that.

Please see my post on the other thread; perhaps another visit is warranted.

Good luck!

24.<<<danbrenn>>>
I was just saying it is unfair to rank ND as 200-300 using a "global university" ranking, when you are making it seem like ND is that low for academics only.

25.<<<posterX>>>
The World University ranking is actually an "academics only" ranking, and has Notre Dame in the 200-300 category.

The Newsweek "Global University" Ranking, which considers international students as a small part of its measures, only ranks the top 100 programs, and, although it is highly correlated to the academics only ranking, it is possible that Notre Dame is somewhere in the 100-200 range.. we don't know for sure.

26.<<<danbrenn>>>
alright, you are right about the World University Rankings, but they also have the University of Arizona 13 spots before Duke. Rankings are so unreliable, because you can use any criteria you want to rank schools. The publication in question ranks based on number of scientific publications on the web. Everyone has an hidden motive, and the World University Ranking system is no exception.

"With these rankings we intend to provide extra motivation to researchers worldwide for publishing more and better scientific content on the Web, making it available to colleagues and people wherever they are located"

I may be Bias, but ND is a little better academically than you are making it out to be. I guess the best thing to do is just go with what feels right.

27.<<<Kr123>>>
There is a great catholic church down the street from Yale. They have a campus ministry program for catholics. Theology on Tap is in New Haven. My daughter was mugged there about a month ago as she was walking with a priest and there was an armed robbery the same night on one of the streets she was walking on.. My sister graduated from Yale and has no "family " allegience to it where my uncle graduated from ND in 1932 and we all feel forever tied to the ND family. My youngest will be attending in the Fall. Yale is a great school you should go where you feel the best. ND has the intangibles that are hard to describe but everyone feels them. Good luck

28.<<<irish68178>>>
What the global rankings are probably doing is discounting Notre Dame because we have a weak graduate school and hence weak research (though great research opportunities for undergraduates). While they are working on fixing this, it is important to note that we follow a Princeton model where we focus on the undergraduate and not the graduate education. THIS IS IMPORTANT PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS. At a lot of schools, if you want to do research, you are going to play second fiddle to graduate students. That is not the case at Notre Dame, I personally have met with my thesis adviser more this year than either of her graduate students, lol. The opportunities are here!

As for the rankings, posterx, give it up! It is obvious that those are not valid rankings. If you really believe that the University of Arizona is better than Duke, I hope you aren't at a prestigious university wasting your money. Rather, you should have gone to any public U that is huge and has high research output. Rankings should pass the "common sense" rule in my mind, and those rankings simply don't pass in my book!

Kr123, sorry that I missed this but is your youngest coming to ND or Yale? I can't remember and I am a bit confused.

29.<<<Kr123>>>
Irish our youngest is going to ND you were kind enough to read her essay.

30.<<<posterX>>>
Danbrenn and irish68178, the University of Arizona is an academically up-and-coming and highly-ranked university. It's one of the best in the country now. Duke is overrated. Furthermore, the rankings of UA and Duke are very close. I would consider them equals. Meanwhile, the difference between Yale and ND in the rankings (and hundreds of other similar measures) is utterly enormous.

In terms of crime rates, here is a list of 200 metropolitan areas ranked by per capita murder rates. You will notice that South Bend is one of the most dangerous metro areas in the country, with a rate of 8.2 killings per 100,000 residents, worse than Newark, Philadelphia and New York City, while New Haven is one of the safest, with a rate of 3.3. South Bend is clearly not as bad as New Orleans, but everything I've ever heard about the area around Notre Dame has been far from positive, while almost everything I hear about New Haven is that it is one of the nation's best college towns, in the league of Burlington, Madison and Northampton (not to mention very close to some of the country's most exciting large cities and most beautiful beaches and mountains).

Also, according to the Department of Education's statistics, Notre Dame reported 87 campus burglaries and 57 residential hall burglaries. Yale reported only 63 campus burglaries and 35 residential hall burglaries. The schools have virtually identical student populations.

In terms of campus loyalty, I think it would be ridiculous to say ND alums are more loyal than Yale alums, given that the per capita dollar amount of alumni giving (e.g., not counting the people who only contribute a dollar) to Yale exceeds that of every other university in the country except Caltech almost every year, while ND is rarely among the top 10.

31.<<<irish68178>>>
Sorry about that Kr123, I look over so many things it is hard to keep everything straight :).

What further need for discussion is there, you just said that Arizona is equal to Duke! I doubt you could find people on the Arizona board that would say that! I have to wonder, honestly, about any person or rankings which believe that. Nothing against AZ, but come on!

South Bend does have a high crime rate, I will not argue against this. However, Notre Dame is a VERY safe campus in my opinion. I have never felt threatened in any way walking acorss campus.
[quote]The schools have virtually identical student populations.[/quote]

Did you honestly research before posting this? Yale enrollment: 5,303...ND enrollment 8,346 (source Princeton Review). Notre Dame is almost 40% bigger! Don't try to mislead. Here is the link to the ND security information from NDSP themselves, the best source. <url>http://www.nd.edu/%7Endspd/clery06.pdf</url>. Judge for yourself but I think we have a pretty safe campus, especially given that South Bend isn't the safest city.

As for networks, I don't know if Yale alums give more, props to them if they do...but that doesn't affect you directly. ND has a larger alumni network and they have been known to bend over backwards to help out other ND alums. That is why our alumni network is so well-known. I will not use stats or anything like that on this one, I will let their actions speak for themselves. I would put our alumni up against ANY school in the world. I really would. LOVE THEE NOTRE DAME!

32.<<<SweetLax88>>>
PosterX that ranking is a load of bullock. Quoted Hawkette:

According to Newsweek International, their List uses the following methodology in composing its ranking:

1. 50% of score divided equally among three measures
a. the number of highly cited researchers in various academic fields
b. the number of articles published in Nature and Science
c. the number of articles listed in ISI Social Sciences and Arts &amp; Humanities indices

2. 40% of the score divided equally among four measures
a. the percentage of international faculty
b. the percentage of international students
c. the citations per faculty member (using ISI data)
d. the ratio of faculty to students

3. 10% of the score is decided by library holdings (number of volumes)


Just to put this in perspective, UC Berkeley is 5th, U Michigan is 11th and UCLA is 12th. By contrast, Princeton is 15th, Brown is 56th, U Virginia is 80th, Emory is 93rd, and Dartmouth, Rice, and Notre Dame (among other notables) are not ranked. Clearly, this ranking is using a methodology that is out of sync with how the vast majority of Americans would view these schools.

In the second List, the methodology is not disclosed, but seems to rely on a combination of factors involving Alumni, Awards, and some factors called HiCi, N&amp;S (Nature &amp; Science?), SCI, and Size. The results are again highly inconsistent with how most observers would see American educational institutions. For example, UCSD is ranked 13th and UCLA is 14th while Duke is 31st, Northwestern is 33rd, Brown is 85th and Emory, Dartmouth, Notre Dame and other top privates are not ranked in the top 100.

It appears that neither of these rankings give any weight to measurements of the quality of the student body nor to nearly all of the Graduation/Retention, Faculty Resources and Financial Resources measurements that are useful for evaluating the quality of an undergraduate experience.

33.<<<SweetLax88>>>
As you can see, those rankings don't really make any real sense. The day you find someone who picks UCLA over Princton (no financial reasons), call me collect.

34.<<<jags861>>>
SweetLax,

i'm sure the rate of people picking UCLA over Princeton is about the same as people picking ND over Princeton...

35.<<<notredamebrother>>>
Yes, she is very happy an Notre Dame. My mom, on the other hand...

36.<<<posterX>>>
SweetLax, actually, UCLA is a world famous research university, and one of the best in the world, just like UCSD and UCSF/UC-Berkeley. Princeton has some good departments, but in terms of research, it isn't at the same level as a global university like, say, MIT, Yale or Harvard.

I'm sorry you don't agree with the rankings, but they are what they are. And, as world university rankings, they are remarkably consistent in showing schools like Harvard, Yale, MIT, Oxford and Cambridge at the top, while universities with smaller endowments, fewer resources, and far less groundbreaking research or academic activity like the University of East Anglia, Brown, ND, Tufts, Emory, University of Delaware are (in the case of ND) in the 200-300 ranking range and far below what some people think of as their peers.

Irish, the enrollment figures on the US Dept of Education website are virtually identical (both schools at 11,000) because of the graduate and professional student populations.

37.<<<danbrenn>>>
jags861 and posterx, Do ya'll just hate Irish Catholics or something? You keep attacking Notre Dame with rediculous rankings and misinformation that have no revelance at all. The World University ranking has to do with how much research is published on the Web by professors...I guess that is what makes a school academically competant.

38.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
There are a lot of people here who picked ND over HYPS.

39.<<<posterX>>>
I would hardly say that the Newsweek Global University Ranking has no relevance, given that tens of millions of people around the world have read it and it is considered to be one of the definitive rankings of global universities out there. Add it to the other rankings I've cited, which are also widely cited by thousands of other people, and you probably have hundreds of millions of people.

Yes, there are many measures of academic competence and I've always said that forget the rankings -- the best way to find out where you will do best is to visit for 3-4 days, talk to as many students and professors as possible, and find out where you will succeed academically. But when all the available rankings out there show an enormous gap (of hundreds of spots) between a couple of schools you're choosing from, you might want to do a bit of extra research and think carefully. That's all.

If you want to move away from research or how many students go to the top graduate schools (both of which measures ND lags far behind), look at a few other factors, like how many students receive Fulbright, Gates, Rhodes or Marshall Scholars.

Here is a list of institutions producing Fulbright Scholars this year, from Chronicle of higher education. Note that the number of applicants is fairly consistent from each school (although large schools like UC Berkeley have a few more than smaller ones), but the number who win from each school is very different:

1 Yale U. 31
2 Harvard U. 25
3 Brown U. 24
4 Columbia U. 21
4 U . of California at Berkeley 21
4 U. of Michigan at Ann Arbor 21
7 U. of Chicago 18
7 U. of Pennsylvania 18
9 Cornell U. 15
10 Duke U. 14
10 Johns Hopkins U. 14
10 Northwestern U. 14
10 U. of Wisconsin at Madison 14
14 Boston College 13
14 Ohio U. main campus 13
14 Pennsylvania State U. at University Park 13
14 Princeton U. 13
14 U. of California at Los Angeles 13
14 U. of Texas at Austin 13
20 New York U. 12
21 Arizona State U. at Tempe 11
21 George Washington U. 11
23 College of William and Mary 10
23 Stanford U. 10
23 U. of Arizona 10
23 U. of Pittsburgh 10
Notre Dame: Fewer than 10 (did not register)

And now Rhodes Scholarships:
- Since the scholarship was created in 1902, Notre Dame has had 14 Rhodes Scholarship winners, almost all of them prior to 2000.
- Since just 2002, Yale has had more than 15 Rhodes Scholarship winners; since 1902, it has had nearly 200.
[Even though Yale is one of the smallest universities in the country by undergraduate enrollment and much smaller than ND, it has produced more Rhodes Scholars than any other university except Harvard by a huge margin.]

40.<<<SweetLax88>>>
PosterX, no one said ND was a great grad school or research school. Most of us don't want to do research, we want a great education, and in my case, family of alums. Of course its not going to be on the best international school research list...its not a research school. I still stand by what I say, no one picks UCLA over Princeton.

41.<<<posterX>>>
Of course. But none of those rankings are research lists.

42.<<<anonymom7>>>
Fulbright Scholarships should not be used as an indicator.....My son who is a Junior was asked by his school to complete the application and he decided a Fulbright does not match his career goals..perhaps other schools have students simliar to my son, do not have the time and energy to fill out another application....I noticed his school is not on the Fullbright list but has been ranked in the top 5 of USNEWS for several years...

43.<<<dcircle>>>
posterX is a ****. search for his last five most recent entries. he scours this website for opportunities to boost yale at the expense of every other university

44.<<<irish68178>>>
Looking at Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships kind of downplay our excellent business school, don't they? That doesn't seem like a great ranking methodology to me at least. Also, there are a lot of factors about ND which can't be ranked, such as how happy the students are and how successful they are after ND.

As for your rankings, it sounds like you are looking at rankings that are including graduate programs which makes no sense because we are talking about UNDERGRADUATE. When I decided to come to ND I didn't care how strong the grad programs are...and I still don't. Again, having strong grad programs can actually HURT undergrad education because professors focus more on the grad students than undergrads and there are fewer research opportunities for grad students. Here, many professors will tell you that they prefer working with undergraduates, and that is part of the reason that undergraduates have so many research options. I myself was awarded a grant to do research here...there are a lot of graduate students who can't say that!

This discussion is about undergraduate education, and hence I personally am going to ignore (other than pointing it out) anything that is based on anything but undergraduate, because it is simply superfluous. I put these world rankings in that category because it has, according to you, Yale and ND with approximately equal enrollments which tells me they are looking at graduate schools as well and that is beyond our scope.

Also, I am going to stress this one more time, at Yale the graduate students probably will get most of your professors' attention as well as most of the research opportunities. You probably won't be able to run your senior thesis in a lab for a semester like I did here. If you are looking at doing any kind of research, you should look into what undergrads are able to do and what the opportunities are. Yale may have great opportunities for grad students (and they do, it is an amazing school) but I would worry about undergrad playing second fiddle.

45.<<<posterX>>>
I wouldn't worry about that, irish, considering that Yale alumni get into the top graduate Ph.D. and other programs at a rate higher than that of any other university in America, in every field --- and at much higher rates than those of Notre Dame. Perhaps the most prestigious sign of getting into any grad program you want, the Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford, is just one example of that, and Yale's placement of several of its undergraduates each year as Rhodes Scholars, when there are only 32 awarded each year across the entire country, is the envy of the nation. Notre Dame has one scholar every five years if it is very lucky. Also, I would consider things such as the fact that Yale has the smallest undergraduate class sizes of any university in America, and, particularly in the most popular majors, by far the lowest student to faculty ratios of anywhere except Caltech. In the Princeton Review rankings, Yale was recently ranked the #1 "Best Overall Undergraduate Academic Experience" in the country, above many tiny liberal arts colleges like Swarthmore; while world-famous newspaper columnist David Brooks, a UChicago alumnus, has recently written an article in the Washington Monthly explaining why Yale "provides the best undergraduate experience in America."

46.<<<danbrenn>>>
Posterx did you get rejected from ND or something?

47.<<<posterX>>>
No, I think Notre Dame is a fine school. I personally know many alums, some very well. But to be honest, come to think of it, I am 100% sure that they would be the first to tell you to go to Yale if you got in.

48.<<<danbrenn>>>
Are you a current student or alum of Yale then?

49.<<<jags861>>>
danbrenn,

i have nothing against notre dame...nor "irish catholics"...i'm catholic after all. i just expressed my personal view that if I were choosing between notre dame and yale...i'd choose yale. how does that make me hate notre dame?

If the OP had said notre dame or rutgers i would have said notre dame. if the OP had said Notre Dame or UCLA I would have said "whichever one you think is prettier or like more." But I think Yale is a better school than Notre Dame...and so do plenty of other people.

50.<<<danbrenn>>>
I agree that if you are looking at academics Yale is better than Notre Dame, but it just seems silly to come on the Notre Dame forum and put it down over and over agian.

51.<<<jags861>>>
show me where i put notre dame down.

52.<<<danbrenn>>>
Alright, that was mainly directed towards posterx, my apologies.

53.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Notre Dame beats the crap out of UCLA any day...

And PosterX, you sure talk about Yale alot...I mean its good, but then why is Princeton and Harvard considered better?

54.<<<posterX>>>
They aren't considered "better", as many of the posts above show.

55.<<<danbrenn>>>
posterx are you at Yale now?

[quote]I wouldn't worry about that, irish, considering that Yale alumni get into the top graduate Ph.D. and other programs at a rate higher than that of any other university in America, in every field--- and at much higher rates than those of Notre Dame[/quote]

What evidence of that do you have? I at least have gone through getting into graduate school and was quite successful. Do you have any evidence at all to back up this claim?
[quote]Best Overall Undergraduate Academic Experience" in the country, above many tiny liberal arts colleges like Swarthmore; while world-famous newspaper columnist David Brooks, a UChicago alumnus, has recently written an article in the Washington Monthly explaining why Yale "provides the best undergraduate experience in America."[/quote]

I think that generalizations like that are kind of BS honestly. Yale is a great school, no doubt, but it depends on what you are looking for. I WOULD HATE YALE, and it is nothing against them, but I would hate it. It depends on what is best for that individual, like I have been arguing the whole time. You can't say generically that it is the best college experience, IMO. It may be the best for a certain group of people, but not for everyone.
[quote]I agree that if you are looking at academics Yale is better than Notre Dame, but it just seems silly to come on the Notre Dame forum and put it down over and over agian.[/quote]

Agreed to an extent, but then again the OP should hear from both sides. If they were all over our board, I would be more concerned. This I think is just important discussion that will hopefully help the OP make the best decision for them.

57.<<<posterX>>>
Open minded, aren't you, generalizing about a school experience that you haven't yourself experienced? I am just pointing out the facts, of which there are many available. Let's leave it at that.

58.<<<ducktape>>>
PosterX, loyalty can be measured in ways other than money- if possible, I would challenge you with the percentage of legacies that apply to ND- I guarantee that more kids born to ND alums end up applying than Yale alums. ND is a family- Yale, not so much. Don't get me wrong, Yale is a phenomenal school. If the OP is really looking for a close knit, CATHOLIC environment, it's nearly impossible to beat Notre Dame.

Also, in terms of academics, ND and Yale are similar but not equal- however, they are not anywhere <b>near</b> 200 rankings apart. Just lay off with the rankings already.

59.<<<posterX>>>
The highly-regarded Jiaotong world university and Newsweek rankings disagree with you, but I will let people draw conclusions from them as they will. Being in the top 300 isn't that bad, you know -- there are many great universities in this world. It's nothing to be ashamed of if you are ranked below the University of Buenos Aires in overall academic quality/impact. This is a planet of 6 billion and being in the top 300 is a very, very rare honor.

You are absolutely correct that loyalty can be measured in many ways, of course -- I just think it would be absurd to claim that Yale is not a "family" (Yale College's most famous tagline is "at once a tradition, a company of scholars, a society of friends") or that Yale alumni are less loyal to their school, given the available information about the extent to which Yale alumni, and those of similar places (Harvard alumni, and Princeton alumni), network with one another, return for reunions and contribute regularly to their alma maters. Yale's reunion attendance rates are significantly higher than most of its "peer" schools.

Look carefully at the top leadership of any business or government department and you'll see some of this at work. I think there is a reason that, in Susan Caminiti's "Where the CEOs went to [undergrad] College" article in Fortune Magazine, Yale was ranked #1 at producing CEOs, followed at a distance by Princeton, while schools like ND were not among the top ten. It's not just because Yale and Princeton have the smartest students flocking to their shores, it's because many of their graduates take advantage of extremely powerful and close-knit alumni networks.

This is not just true of the schools as a whole, but also of their extremely well-funded organizations such as the Catholic Chapels and Centers (I believe the Catholic center at Yale just got a new $25,000,000 student activity center taking up almost an entire block next to the campus and chapel), the Jewish Life Centers, the African-American Centers, the Korean church groups, the volunteer/social service groups and all the other "families" on the campuses. Those organizations all keep active mailing lists and invite their alumni back to campus on a regular basis.

60.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Give me a break. Those rankings are crap and you know it. Like the University of Bueno Aires is better than Notre Dame.

61.<<<SweetLax88>>>
And you really are embarrassing yourself with these rankings, you really think UVA is as good as Duke?

62.<<<posterX>>>
UVA is a fantastic university, one of the best in the country.

63.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Yes. I agree, to an extent. It is a fantastic university but not one of the best in the country. Its business school however is. Nonetheless, it is still not on the level as Duke.

64.<<<posterX>>>
SweetLax88, the Newsweek Global University ranking has Duke at #14 in the world and UVA at #80 (which actually isn't too bad -- its just below the University of Western Australia and Carnegie Mellon). So I'm not really sure where you're coming from. What's significant is when the rankings all agree that, for example, ND is not in the top 100 worldwide, or top 200, in the case of the other one.

<url>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14321230/</url>

65.<<<danbrenn>>>
posterX, we get the whole ranking thing already. Yale is better than ND in probably any ranking you will ever look at, but so many intangibles go into deciding where to go to school, that rankings should have no effect on where a person decides to go. I would go to ND over Yale any day, and you would go to Yale over ND any day. Please give the rankings a break and tell us why you love Yale so much. This might actually help the person who started the thread make a decision. I am very curious as to why you are so passionate about boosting Yale up on all these threads. Do you have any affiliation with the University at all, or are you just a fan?

66.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
Ah man I just read that ranking and it's hilarious! The idea that Michigan beats out Princeton... that'll be the day. Even USNWR uses better criteria. That ranking is based largely on the size of the school. Larger schools will have an advantage. Of course, institutes of technology will also have an advantage since research is their primary concern. But really, ND not even ranked? HA. That's a real laugh. More than 50% of the students who are here had ND as their first choice. Our alumni giving rate is terrific-53.2% (<url>http://media.www.ndsmcobserver.com/media/storage/paper660/news/2006/09/14/News/Record.Number.Of.Nd.Alums.Donate.Money-2271570.shtml)</url>, which is behind Princeton and ABOVE FRIGGIN' YALE. (<url>http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/UPA/peers/current/research_intensive/alumgiv.htm</url>). What battlefield do you want to fight on? I'll defend my 'Dame to the death.

67.<<<jags861>>>
sweetlax,

if ND is "one of the best in the country," then UVa is one of the best schools in the country...

68.<<<irish68178>>>
UVA is a great school, no doubt about that. I still say that you should go to the school that fits you best, regardless of rankings. What do I know though, I am just a senior in college.

Just make a decision you won't regret, that is the best advice I can give the OP.

69.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Jags,

Ok...NDs stats and job placement are much higher than UVA's. ND is more selective, given more respect, and has a great alum network. Of course UVA is one of the best schools in the country, ND is just better.

PosterX, enough with the rankings already. I assume you go to Yale since you go yale ****. Any person with a Yale education woudl know that ND is AT LEAST in the top 300 Unis in the world. You would be a fool to believe that ND isn't up there.

70.<<<Eagle79>>>
Reading this topic it seems that people have gotten off topic and into rankings and away from what is right for the student posing the question. They do not want to know about rankings, they probably already know enough about them. What they really want to know about is the environment and that is an emotional thing.

New Haven vs. South Bend, First Years Studies vs Yale's advising system. Student engagement at both schools is excellent but I would suggest making a list of pluses and minuses for each school and figure out how to weigh them. This will usually tip the balance one way or the other not becase of the analysis but because the thought will crystalize what is important to you.

Some things that are not being said is about the strong service nature of Notre Dame and catholic schools in general. ND and other catholic schools send significant numbers of their students into the Peace Corp and other service organizations like the Jesuit Volunteer Corp. I am sure posterx can and will post about how many service opportunities there are at Yale but that may well be besides the point.

On a separate note, some of what we see in this thread is historical. When many Catholics emigrated to the US they were excluded from many of the incumbent schools such as Yale. While other ethnic groups and religions worked hard to assimilate the Catholics founded their own schools and own feeder system. I think that this still exists today to some extent where certain students feel more comfortable in a school that is defined as religious and other want an environment that is secular. Both have their merits and each of us must choose what is best for our own situation.

71.<<<posterX>>>
A quick note on service organizations. Yale's mission statement is to generate leaders for service to society. It pays off because Yale is arguably the most service-minded school in the country, and the vast majority of students there participate in at least one service organization. The Truman Scholarship is the nation's highest honor for college students who do community service or show leadership in their work with service organizations - about 70 are given out to juniors every year, nationwide, and it is an unbelievable opportunity. Even though Yale is a very small school, Yale students annually win more Truman Scholarships than students from any other university in the country. Also, for what its worth, Yale sends more of its graduates to Teach for America than any other university, by a huge margin, and many also participate in the Peace Corps or work in government positions after graduation.

72.<<<jags861>>>
SweetLax,

Are we talking about the same schools? With the exception of ND ranking marginally better than UVa in the USnews rankings due to financial resources...as well as having a better football team, UVa has better rankings in practically any academic discipline (ranking ahead of ND in 40 out of 41 disciplines according to the NRC rankings), as well as being a better feeder school according to the wall street journal, having universally accepted better professional schools than notre dame, and is significantly cheaper than notre dame, I think you have little to stand on in your ascertation. If ND has "more respect" why does UVa get a 4.3 in PA score and Notre Dame only a 3.9? The PA score is strictly opinion of university presidents!

73.<<<posterX>>>
jags, I agree, but I think your point has already been made clear in all the previous posts which dissect the academic quality of ND.

74.<<<jags861>>>
posterx,

i havn't dissected ND's academic quality at all in this thread until my previous post...if you can even call that dissecting. All I said was is that I would got Yale over ND....jeeeeeshh. Besides, I wasn't even responding to you, I was responding to SweetLax. I don't understand what your point is.

75.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Peer assessment scores are extremly biased, especially against Catholic schools. ND has a crappy peer assessment score which is BS when you compare it to other schools. If you eliminate that one score, ND ranks 12th. I believe that is more where it belongs.
The truth is that most academic institutions avoid religion like the plague. Most people in acadamia are very liberal and ND isn't and our ratings suffer b/c of it.

76.<<<Eagle79>>>
posterX,

Your focus clearly is based upon rankings, whether academic or numbers of scholarships including your reference to service components at Yale. While at a certain level rankings are important because it can help inform, the final decision is more of an emotion that only a particular student can make.

About the rankings and scholarships you just mentioned, those are nice but secular in nature. If the student is interested in the Catholic aspects of a university it would be more important to cite the Catholic organizations where Yale and ND placed their students. I would suspect that the numbers would change dramatically if the numbers cited were in reference to more Catholic organizations like how many became Maryknoll missionaries or joined the Jesuit Volunteer Corp.

Though these things may not be of interest to the original poster it is one of the things that make a Catholic University like ND what it is.

Not to take this too far in another direction I would note that Harvard's new curriculum requires classes in Religion. Something that has been required at all Catholic colleges for a long time along with Philosophy. This may be another component in the students decision.

77.<<<Eagle79>>>
I would also ask the original poster whether they have been accepted to ND and invited to be part of the Honors Program. It may be another thing to place on the list of pluses and minuses while they are making their decision.

78.<<<posterX>>>
Eagle, yes, I agree with your points, however, it is worth pointing out that classes in religion are nothing unusual. Yale has a fantastic religious studies department that offers all kinds of courses in every major religion, as well as a well-known divinity school. The classes are among the most popular at Yale, and some students even choose to major in that department.

79.<<<irish68178>>>
While religion courses may be strong at Yale (the department is very strong) the atmosphere is important as well. Yale is probably a secular environment, is it not, whereas ND is a very Catholic environment. This should be kept in mind as well when making the decision.

80.<<<jags861>>>
sweetlax,

"Peer assessment scores are extremly biased, especially against Catholic schools. ND has a crappy peer assessment score which is BS when you compare it to other schools. If you eliminate that one score, ND ranks 12th. I believe that is more where it belongs."

funny thing is, you copied this word for word from a post by irish+#s.

Also, I happen to think the peer assessment only rankings are better than peer assessment free ones. How does freshmen retention rate or a 4 year graduation rate affect the education i'm going to receive? yet those factors play huge roles in the usnews formula. under a peer assessment only ranking, ND chimes in at 31...

also, whats up with this ridiculous notion that theres an "anti-catholic" bias. thats just what people say who...don't like what they get. According to various people on CC, theres an "anti-LAC, Catholic, private, west-coast, middle america, southern, small research institution, common misconception" bias.

81.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Whys that so funny? I quoted Irish because I felt that it was very well said and there was no point in putting it in other words. You want to argue that point and the other point I made, ask Irish68.

82.<<<jags861>>>
sweetlax,

you made no points. everything you said was either made or or had a valid counter argument made. and then you just go on completely ignoring everything i said. If you have something to support any of your claims that doesn't consist of "well thats my opinion, i picked ND over cornell, alumni network, my friend's neighbor said" let me know.

83.<<<irish68178>>>
I will back up Sweetlax on the peer assessment score because I do think some academics feel that if you go to a Catholic school you must not be serious about academics. However, I honestly believe that the peer assessment score is too low. I look at schools I view as being equal (and I like to think I am not too biased and am pretty well educated on these issues, but that is debatable) and ours is just so much lower. Who knows why, I don't get it, but I think it is too low. I know that isn't worth much, but that is how I feel. I can give examples if wanted.

Really I think this whole debate is a bit ridiculous in a way because what school is "best" really depends on the individual, you know? For me, ND is the best school for me, and I would have picked it above any other school. However, I am sure there are people who pick IU over ND for various reasons. It depends what is best for YOU and what YOU are looking for. Regardless in this case, you are going to get a fantastic education and you will be very successful...so you may as well go to the best place for you!

84.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
I don't understand why Catholicism gets a bum rap. The driving force is "Fides et Ratio", also known as "Faith and <i>Reason</i>."

85.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
I think that rankings are hogwash, honestly. One should not choose school the number 36 ranked school over the number 40th ranked school because of the rank. Like Irish said, its different for each individual. To some people the harsh academics and lack on collegiate sports involvement at Uchicago seems perfect, even though to me it sounds like hell. UChicago is consistently ranked high in the us news rankings, however Id choose to go to many lower ranked schools before I would go to uchicago. To me, the best fist is Notre Dame. If I was accepted at any university in the nation, I'd choose to go to Notre Dame. You may say Im crazy, but it "fits" To me, no university embodies the spirit of academcis, family, and activity like Notre Dame. I dont really care if the chemistry department at Harvard is 25 spots higher than it is at Notre Dame, you know? So to me there is no reason why such a heated debate should be sparked by such topic.

86.<<<Eagle79>>>
PosterX,

Yes, Yale has a great Divinity School, which is a grad school, and has classes in religion. However, a class in religion is not required. It really depends upon your perspective on whether there should be a core requirement, i.e. St. John's great books program or a more open independent exploratory program like Brown. Yale and ND are not at either extreme, though on the scale ND is closer to St John's and Yale is closer to Brown.

Yale has excellent classes in religion, however, a class in religion is not required. While Yale was a religious institution in its founding as the Collegiate School, it is a secular school that has religious classes. ND, like other Catholic schools, have chosen to be Catholic Universities. This choice implies a different challenge than at other schools. Fr. Jenkins has written a lot about this challenge.

At the end of the day, it could be the difference between the schools. To me, I view it as the choice between an ice cream sundae and a banana split. You can't make a wrong choice. Just make the one you think is best for you. You can get in to an excellent graduate school if you work hard at either school.

87.<<<danbrenn>>>
posterX, why do you care so much about bragging on everything to do with Yale? If you are a student, then you must have way too much to study and be way too smart to even care. If you are an alum, you probably are successful, and have no reason to care anymore. Just tell giggidy why Yale was, is, or will be a good fit for you and be done with it already.

88.<<<jags861>>>
just a quick edit, I meant to say "made up or" not "made or or"...oh well.

89.<<<Eagle79>>>
Danbrenn, it is quite appropriate for posterx to engage in this discussion because it is a discussion about comparing Yale and ND. That is what the original poster wanted to compare so they can make an informed decision. It is best if the discussion is not one sided one way or the other. I would suggest that irish and others check the Yale board to see if a similar discussion is underway there.

90.<<<irish68178>>>
It may be, but I usually try to avoid other boards unless they are not getting any responses there just because I feel like a **** otherwise. I may not be, but I figure the Yale people can answer the Yale questions over there, we can answer the ND questions here, and then the OP can make their decision.

I hate to go over to other boards because it usually ends up like this; the debate takes a turn for the worst and it ends up with people on both sides bickering over rankings or who knows what and the person who gets forgotten is the OP. Truth be told I don't care where the OP goes, as long as they go to the best school for them. If that is Yale, that is fine! I just don't want to start a fight over on the Yale boards, but I will at least peak to see what is going on over there.

91.<<<irish68178>>>
I did look at the Yale board and it actually was very even, so I am content leaving it as it is, though I think our discussion was far better. What is funny is that PosterX kept getting shot down on his own board.

<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/showthread.php?t=332799</url>

sweetlax,

95.<<<danbrenn>>>
Eagle, It is alright for posterX to participate in a discussion about the advantages of Yale and Notre Dame, but if you read the entire thread, it seems like he has been just trying to start fights over rankings and such. This is not helpful to anyone, and it just leads to long, hostile and stupid arguments.

96.<<<Eagle79>>>
Irish, I agree. A nice balanced, though limited, discussion on the Yale board.

97.<<<ChiSoxGirl22>>>
Giddidy, I dunno if you are still around because this thread went a little off-topic, but today I decided on going to ND next year over Penn. I really did like both schools, and I felt honored to be accepted at a great school like Penn, but there is just something special about ND. Everytime I walk onto the campus, it just feels like somewhere I can fit in and feel at home. It just feels right. Obviously, wherever you go, you will get a fantastic education and you'd probably be happy at either place. Like other people said, though, ND has those intangibles -- regardless of rankings.

98.<<<AlDomerDad>>>
Top 100 Global Universities is not equal to Top 100 Universities in the World

Their emphasis is on "Global" - read the dang article X

And UConn is not in Notre Dame's league academically; it probably has a more "international" faculty

99.<<<posterX>>>
UConn is better.

100.<<<Omniscient1>>>
lol, I go to UConn, and UConn is not better than Notre Dame. It can compete with Notre Dame on many levels, though.

101.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
PosterX, your blind, limited way of thinking about things as well as your habit of dodging questions makes me question the Yale reputation.

102.<<<Eagle79>>>
PCB,

If posterx wants to rely on those rankings and all they entail it is his/her perogative. However, I suspect we would find that posters on the Yale thread with the same name believe that ND would provide a better academic experience than UConn. As Omciscient1 said, UConn can compete with ND on many levels but most people would think that ND would provide a better academic experience.

I would suggest that posterx not get painted with a broad Yale or UConn brush but a very narrow and limited one.

103.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
All you have to do is go to the Yale board to see how much of an attention-craving loser this PosterX kid is

104.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Its pretty sad that Yale accepts people like this.

105.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
That kid got into Yale, wow

106.<<<posterX>>>
You don't have to slam UConn - which is a fantastic university that has been growing and developing arguably more quickly than any other university in the country over the past 10 years - in order to prop up Notre Dame, just because UConn is ranked higher. I was just at UConn and students were studying harder there than just about any other university I've seen, and also there were dozens of fantastic new buildings filled with researchers. The acceptance rate to get in there has plummeted.

The rankings are what they are, and the data are also extremely valid for what they are. I'm not saying you have to pay attention to them. Rankings can give a valid picture of a certain aspect of something, especially if there is a gap of hundreds of places between one thing and another (just a few places means nothing, of course), but they are limited in terms of what they are telling you beyond that.

107.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
I dont think anyone was bashing UConn, posterX. However, I believe we were bashing YOU and your pointless messages whose only purposes is to create an argument.

I think UConn is a great university, and is probably a fantastic option for many students. But, I think most will agree that Notre Dame is on a different level than UConn, however that doesn't take away from Uconn's validity.

108.<<<posterX>>>
Actually, no, I don't think most people would agree with that. I'm just saying, make your points without totally bashing schools that you think are worse just because they are ranked much higher, not even because you have spent time at them.

109.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
When did I every bash UConn?? I was bashing you, there's a difference

Here is a quote that I said in post #107

"I think UConn is a great university, and is probably a fantastic option for many students." --- and the negativity is where?

Can you read, bud? I recommend Hooked on Phonics, or Dr. Seuss for starters. They work well with pre-schoolers, and are on the same intelligence level as yourself. Your neighborhood Borders should do the trick.

110.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
I think this kid is propping up a school he was too inadequate to get into. Look at the USNWR rankings. There isn't a gap of hundreds of spaces because that ranking at least has some legitimacy. You and the ranking are jokes, you ****. Go home.

111.<<<Omniscient1>>>
I am a senior graduating from UConn in a couple weeks, and can tell you that the undergrad rankings mean ****. Believe me...

For undergrad, Notre Dame has always been strong. UConn was a lousy school 12 years ago, and the state of Connecticut was experiencing a brain drain problem. Give the school 10 to 15 years, and you will be comparing Notre Dame with UConn the same way it is being compared with Yale on this board.

In terms of grad programs....UConn is definitely on Notre Dame's level. Top 50 medical, law, and education schools....and a business school that in just a few years will experience a jump into the top 50....

also, what is this **** comment?

112.<<<posterX>>>
Connecticut experiencing a brain drain? Last time I checked, CT was by far the wealthiest state in America, had the most millionaires per capita, had the highest percentage of people with college degrees AND the highest percentage of people with advanced degrees, of any state in the nation. NY, California and Massachusetts have been losing much more population.

113.<<<danbrenn>>>
I believe that he means that people have recently been leaving Conn. to get their undergrad degrees.

114.<<<Omniscient1>>>
Read the following posterX, and then leave collegeconfidential.com for good. You are not only embarrassing yourself, but me as well. Please do not advocate for UConn.

<url>http://www.neasc.uconn.edu/introduction.htm</url>

115.<<<posterX>>>
Sure, people leave to get more degrees, that happens in every wealthy state. But it doesn't mean smart people don't come back or move in. About half the people I know from New York who eventually got their Ph.D. moved to Connecticut. That's just where the best jobs and smartest people are. Like I said, it is by far the smartest and most educated state in the country. Omniscient, what's the reaccred study for?

116.<<<irish68178>>>
PosterX, just admit you were wrong on this one. You tried to use the "educated state" argument to show that UConn is a great school, you got shot down, and now you are trying to say that the smartest people come back to Connecticut? That is great, and may be true, but it tells us nothing about UConn.

I give you credit, you go down with the ship, but one of these days you are going to have to admit that those rankings aren't worth jack.

117.<<<Omniscient1>>>
Go to a school you feel comfortable going to. Believe me when I tell you that recruiters do not look at the rankings....

Lets get started on another discussion....

I heard, a while back, from the head FMP (Financial Management Program) recruiter for GE that GE does not recruit from Ivy League schools for the FMP. The FMP is pretty much the best entry level corporate job in the world. When asked why this was, he replied, we do not like the way Ivy League students think...it does not fit in well with GE. This coming from one of the head recruiters for the most admired company in the world....UConn and Notre Dame, by the way, are 2 of the 35 target schools for the FMP.....Discuss.

118.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
It probably has something to do with the heavy emphasis on business ethics that Mendoza is known for.

119.<<<Omniscient1>>>
Perhaps it is. Mendoza is an unbelievable business school.

120.<<<posterX>>>
"The FMP is pretty much the best entry level corporate job in the world."

I highly doubt that, given that I know dozens of HYP graduates who made $130k in corporate jobs right out of college, got into any MBA or JD program they wanted two years afterwards, and now probably make over $250k+ even though they are still in their 20s.

Also I know several HYP grads who worked for GE corporate HQ right after they got their BAs; they worked with top mentors and got very high salaries, so your point is pretty much moot.

121.<<<Omniscient1>>>
oooo boy, not again.....here comes posterx to wreck the day.

122.<<<jags861>>>
PosterX,

I guess you havn't checked in a while. Connecticut isn't even the wealthiest state in the country, New Jersey is.

123.<<<Omniscient1>>>
lol...dirty jersey?....im jk....

Connecticut relies upon Fairfield County for its amazing wealth. Fairfield county should be its own state..haha. Without Fairfield county, Connecticut would be no where near the top of the highest per capita list. No county in America is as wealthy as Fairfield county.

I really wish I had as much free time as you have PosterX...anyway, back to thesis.

126.<<<maybetransfer>>>
hey i just read your thread and i wanted to say.. having chosen between great schools, but going against my instinct and choosing a "better" name (both schools were in the top 15... ha)... you have instincts for a reason and you should go with them. undergrad is not AS important as people think namewise because an undergrad degree won't get you anywhere... if you want to get down to names... wait til grad school... then choose the HYP over Vandy or something like that... but for real... i went against my instinct and I'd had a very hard time at my HYP school ( i wont say which one :-)) It is a FABULOUS school... but something just hasn't clicked for me... and I think I even knew that when I was applying... i was never one of those ivy-or-bust kids... and i very much regret now doing what i thought i was supposed to do vs. what i felt was right. You can't explain or rationalize instincts... but they're there. and sometimes it's those completely inexplicable gut feelings that are the most important. either way you will be fine and probably happy...and if not.. transfer!

127.<<<posterX>>>
You can transfer to ND; you can't transfer to Yale (well, you can, but they only take a couple out of about a thousand who try)

128.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
That means nothing.

129.<<<posterX>>>
The fact Yale has the lowest transfer accept rate in America actually does say something. It says A) that Yale is more desirable than just about any other school, and B) that people at Yale stay there and end up graduating. The transfer acceptance rate is only that low because nobody ever decides to leave -- because they all love it so much. At other schools, a large number of students transfer away or drop out. That's why you can get in as a transfer.

130.<<<SweetLax88>>>
Actually it doesnt say that Yale is a more desirable school. At all...how can a person with your intelligence get into Yale is beyond me. They must take some underqualified applicants or something.

131.<<<danbrenn>>>
posterX, you are trying to make us believe that Yale is the greatest place on earth, but now anyone who has read this thread feels a kind of embarassment for Yale because of your ignorant ramblings.

132.<<<Eagle79>>>
danbrenn,

I think most people have enough intelligence to separate one poster from a school. Not sure how posting statistics on the wealth of Connecticut matters in this discussion for a number of reasons:

- There are a good number of students at ND from CT
- There is a majority of students at Yale from outside CT
- This is not a discussion about what is best based upon some ranking scheme but what is best for the original poster based upon a number of inputs

Posterx was providing a number of reasons to choose Yale early in the discussion. He has since started posting irrelevant stats that generate more heat than light. I would suggest that we do as Irish suggested and read the reasoned opinions on the Yale board on this same topic. Many of which suggested that the OP go to ND. At the end of the day, the OP needs to make a reasoned decision and I would prefer that we stay on topic. I am sure they have enough discernment to sort the facts based upon what has been posted. They can not make a wrong decision and I wish them luck.

133.<<<posterX>>>
Eagle those stats have little to do with the discussion here; they were just a response to another poster's claim. If you want my input on the discussion you have to go back to the early parts of the thread.

134.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
"Eagle those stats have little to do with the discussion here; they were just a response to another poster's claim. If you want my input on the discussion you have to go back to the early parts of the thread."

So you don't accept transfers, whoopty doo. Princeton doesn't accept any, I guess they are better. ND's retention rate is right up there with any Ivy, so the same arguments can be made for ND. The difference is that ND has the first year of studies which results in more transfer openings (long story, I can get into it if anyone cares).

Just remember that Princeton is better than Yale...it comes from your own logic.

136.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>

[quote]Notre Dame's graduation rate of 95 percent is exceeded by only Harvard and Princeton.[/quote]
It would appear that Yale's graduation rate is lower than Notre Dame's. Funny how that works, especially considering we also have some of the world's best athletes who remain here despite several having the ability to leave early for the professional realm and make a lot of money.

Hmmm, let's analyze this data:
1) Some athletes do leave early. This affects ND a lot more than Yale since ND's athletes are a lot better.
2) The logical conclusion from the above is that, in order to come out ahead numerically, ND's non-athletic population must have a graduation rate above 95%, further increasing the gap between Yale and Notre Dame.
3) If this is the case, then ND's students must be more satisfied with their school than Yale's students.

137.<<<Omniscient1>>>
Both are excellent schools....just leave it at that.

138.<<<Eagle79>>>
Posterx,

Yes, your early posts provided stats that could help inform a decision. However, there was a dramatic turn at post 99 where you made a reference out of the blue to UConn and then you turned it farther away from the topic of discussion by citing stats about residents of CT.

References to NMS students is helpful but it is also important to look at outcomes. Using sports as a metaphor, there are many McDonalds All-Americans in basketball that are busts in college. There are also players that are virtually unrecruited who become all-stars and league MVPs in major Division 1 programs.

When talking about stats it is important to remember that the average SAT score at ND is about 1400, top 2%. While Yale's average score is higher we are talking about students in the same class academically . . . at least according to SAT scores.

Further, since Yale's overall class is smaller than NDs, if you eliminate the bottom 25% of the incoming ND class SAT wise (taking a class of 2000 class down to 1500 like Yale) you would find that the stats are even more comparable between the schools. This is true at many schools, think large well known state schools, only they would eliminate 75% of their incoming class to get to the number in each class at Yale.

Regardless, when all is said and done, it does come down to a gut emotional decision. Shellzie chose ND and has been happy with it. Many at Yale had to make a similar decision and are happy with their decision. If it was me I would look closely at the program(s) of interest to the OP. I suspect that if they wanted to major in Irish Studies ND would be a better school where Yale may be a better school for other things. Though I still don't understand how ND became the "Fighting Irish" when they were founded by a bunch of French missionaries. ;-)

139.<<<danbrenn>>>
"Though I still don't understand how ND became the "Fighting Irish" when they were founded by a bunch of French missionaries."

hmmm.... maybe one of the current students could help us out with this...

140.<<<irish68178>>>
I am sitting in class, so I shouldn't answer this, but I am going to give the short answer.

Some papers called our football team the "Fighting Irish" as a slap at the school as the "Fighting Irish" term was derogatory towards Catholics at the time. We decided to embrace it and show that the "Fighting Irish" can be pretty darn good, hence why we are the "Fighting Irish".

There is more to the story, but that is the 30 second version.

141.<<<Eagle79>>>
Don't take time out of class . . . that was more of a wise-crack than anything.

142.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
I heard that we became the Fighting Irish back in the day when our football team was the Ramblers. We were losing a game and the captain said something to the effect of, "What's the matter guys? You're all Irish and you aren't fighting worth a lick!" We subsequently won.

143.<<<irish68178>>>
That is another rumor, I think mine has more evidence behind it (that it was newspaper people who started it) but no one really knows.

144.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
You're a rumor.

145.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
hahahah what^

I always thought it was Irish's reason

146.<<<irish68178>>>
Really? That would be cool! Irish68178...the man, the myth...or both. Perhaps I am just a figment of your imagination and don't really exist. I am just the hunchback of ND, living in the bell tower. Don't tell anyone!

147.<<<Tim_ND08>>>
OH Irish68178! I heard about him from one of my friends, only a rumor though. I heard he went crazy over the mediocre "the shirt" design and fled to the hills of west Virginia to never be heard from again.

148.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
<url>http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0609.national.html</url>

Just thought I would throw that out there, and mention the fact that in this particular ranking ND and Yale are quite close.

149.<<<Eagle79>>>
Interesting rankings . . . though quite limited in its definition of "Community Service". I would suspect that Brigham Young would rank a lot higher if they counted the one-year as a Mormon missionary into the equation.

When applied to ND it leaves out the students who become Catholic missionaries of any kind. Of course that is true across the board but I suspect that students at schools that are religiously affiliated would have more students choosing that path than students at more secular schools.

150.<<<posterX>>>
Princeton is 43rd. Right.

151.<<<irish68178>>>
They are no better than the rankings you were using PosterX. Welcome to having a taste of your own medicine. It is just like how we objected that Duke was ranked even with Arizona, and yet you fought that to the death. We at least are objective enough not to fight Princeton being 43rd, or at least I am.

152.<<<posterX>>>
All rankings list their methods. What I have always done is offer an analysis of these underlying figures.  In the case of the figures I cited, they are highly valid. In the case of the WM rankings, the underlying figures are not only mostly unavailable for readers to look at or find for themselves, but also completely flawed in many different ways. In fact, they are so flawed that they have attracted the attention of several internationally-renowned academics working in the area of statistics - specifically, statistics that are utterly flawed and misused. Look them up in the Chronicle of Higher Education and you'll find several scholarly articles on the topic, such as one by Professor Rebecca Goldin, a well-known researcher at George Washington University.

153.<<<Eagle79>>>
posterx,

That is why I like rankings as a starting point. By looking at their methodology you can get behind what the numbers are saying and help formulate your own opinion about the validity of the ranking. Similar to the US News peer assessment these rankings will generate a number of questions about the validity or appropriateness of the methodology. At the end of the day, it is yet another data point in an effort to get a full picture of a university.

154.<<<irish68178>>>
[quote]In the case of the figures I cited, they are highly valid.[/quote]

If you truly think that a measure which puts Arizona and Duke neck and neck is valid, I will let you hang yourself with your own words.

Have you gone over to the Duke board and told them, by the way? They should all know that they can save a lot of money by going to AZ. I wonder if they know and what they were thinking to go to Duke. Crazy people.

155.<<<posterX>>>
As I've said before, Arizona is a world-class university and one of the top research institutions in the United States.

156.<<<PutschCasusBelli>>>
Yeah, Arizona totally owns Duke guys. I mean, sweet Jesus, who would pick Duke over Arizona? I am getting a transfer app right now. I bet Arizona is even ten times better than Yale. If PosterX's pathetic ranking is right, man, did I make the wrong decision by not making Arizona my first choice!

157.<<<irish68178>>>
Easy there Putsch, we have to keep this on the DL. If everyone realizes how good Arizona is they may be as selective as Duke, and we wouldn't want that. No, it is a conspiracy that is keeping AZ down, but let's not let that out of the bag until we both can transfer. I submitted my app last night...I think Poster X beat me to it though.

158.<<<Sam Lee>>>
posterX's very first post seems to imply he's not really Yale student or alum:

Just for comparisons sake, Duke does $521 million worth of research every year. Arizona does $479 million -- more than Harvard, Yale, Caltech, Cornell, Chicago, UNC-Chapel Hill, or Columbia -- and is also considered to be one of the top research universities in the country. Notre Dame does $74 million.

National Academy of Sciences Members in 2005:

Duke 54

Arizona 30 (fine, not quite Yale's 104, Caltech's 104, or Cornell's 64, but still one of the best in the U.S.)

Notre Dame 2

161.<<<irish68178>>>
Do we have to go over this again? Alright, we shall. ND IS NOT A GREAT RESEARCH UNIVERSITY YET. Our grad school is not that great right now, hence why we do not have as much research. This does NOT influence the quality of undergraduate education, which is what we are worrying about here.

Do you consider all of the LACs to be crap, because I am pretty sure they will be low on your scale.

Given the weak graduate school, it is actually a blessing in disguise for undergraduates. I bet that there are more research opportunities for undergrads here than there are at those other schools. Here is an example: I ran my honors thesis in a ND lab using 6 research assistants and paid for it using a ND research grant. How many people from other boards can say that? How many are given that opportunity. I am not saying this to say I am great, I am saying this to show that I am BLESSED to be here.

162.<<<posterX>>>
That sounds like a great opportunity. But I would be careful before knocking the other schools given the astoundingly high rates at which their graduates are placed into the top post-graduate programs like the NSF Fellowships, leading graduate schools, laboratories and research firms. If you look at that data, ND does pretty well but it doesn't place as many into the top fellowships/programs as the HYPMC schools. Actually it has fewer than U of Arizona's undergrad prog.

And yes, there are excellent LACs - the top few for undergraduate science, namely Harvey Mudd, Williams, Pomona, Wellesley, Wesleyan, and in particular, Swarthmore each produce just about as many NSF/NIH fellows, etc., if not more, per capita as the HYPMC caliber schools.

All my post above was for was to point out the UA is considered to be a top university.

163.<<<danbrenn>>>
You have got to realize that this is the Notre Dame thread. The people on here like Notre Dame. If you go the the Yale thread, you will find people who like Yale...just like you.

164.<<<irish68178>>>
University of Arizona has a lot more undergrads. Do you really think that is a fair comparison?

As for NSF Fellowships, I still have qualms about using factors like that. For instance, I did not qualify because I wanted to study clinical psychology, which would enable me to either work as a therapist or as a researcher and NSF will only work for research-only doctorates. I am still going to a PhD program next year and am fully funded (tuition waiver + stipend) but yet I am not counted. Also, ND has a remarkable number of students who do service before going to graduate school, are they counted? Probably not since they didn't go straight through.

All I am saying is it may not be the best indicator. Also, you can get into top schools from ND. I am very happy with my program and I know several people going to Harvard Law and other ridiculous schools next year!

165.<<<posterX>>>
Yes, they are counted regardless of how many years pass between the undergraduate and graduate program. Also, I agree that you can get into top schools from ND and agree that comparing with U of A must take into account that U of A has more than 3 times as many undergraduates.

166.<<<irish68178>>>
Also, according to US News (I don't like their rankings, but let's use it) Arizona is ranked 98th. This is clearly up there with Duke.

The good news is that Saint Louis University is ranked higher, so for all of you SLU applicants, if Arizona is as good as Duke, and SLU is ranked higher than Arizona, then it must also be as good as Duke, right? Don't get me wrong, I have lots of respect for SLU, but seriously, here are some of the schools ranked above Arizona (I can't wait for PosterX's reply, though don't get me wrong, these are not bad schools...they just aren't Duke IMO)...

University of Kansas
University of Tulsa
University of Vermont
Clark University
Iowa State University
Marquette University
North Carolina State -Raleigh
UC-Santa Cruz (go Banana Slugs)
Fordham
Michigan State
BYU
SMU
Minnesota Twin-Cities
Iowa
Rutgers (they should have been Ivy, they got screwed)
Miami-Ohio
University of Pittsburgh
Yeshiva University

Enough, let me just say this....

There are 8 University of California schools ranked higher than Arizona! Granted, the UC system is great, but 8? There are only 10 of them! Clearly Arizona is an elite.

167.<<<Ernie H.>>>
^^^ Hahaha... nice one irish. And my advice would be to ignore posterX - he is a pathetic excuse for a Yalie (if he even is one) and he has no qualms about distorting facts and even outright fibbing. Anything to bring Yale up and/or put other schools down.

168.<<<knights1027>>>
Because of all the early action/single choice stuff schools require these days, with early acceptance rates exponentially higher than regular decision, I've been researching a few of the ivies and how they stack up against ND. Well I was planning on starting a thread asking about the pros and cons of notre dame and yale because most of what I stumbled upon was a bit dated, but after reading through this thread and picking up on the intangibles that were explained (and even demonstrated) in this thread as opposed to the stubborn resistance of PosterX, I think I have a better understanding of why ND is truly special!

I know this is an old thread, just had to say thanks guys! especially you Irish68178 and notredamebrother!!
