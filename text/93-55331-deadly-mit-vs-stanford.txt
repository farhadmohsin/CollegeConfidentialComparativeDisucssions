1.<<<diu9lei>>>
Quite a number (8 maybe?) of my friends got into Stanford and MIT from my giantic high-school, so I am representing all of us to ask the following question:

2.<<<staticsoliloquy>>>
Q1: Disagreed. Research and internship opportunities at MIT are boundless. You want to UROP, just email a professor and set up a meeting. I don't think many Silicon Valley companies would offer many internships and I don't think they would have, and even if they did, it would only be in the summer.

Q2: Disagree. You can't fit each school in its respective category and labeled a few adjectives on there.

Q3: Agreed. I think the depth of work at MIT is much more extensive and challenging and a degree from MIT in CS or physics definitely is respectable, not to say that one from Stanford isn't. But when recruiters look at a resume, and see that the person graduated from MIT, the company KNOWS they're getting someone with great problem-solving skills and a mindset that will contribute to the company.

and I also have the same dilemma: StanMIT =)

3.<<<pebbles>>>
Q2:

I'm socially interesting :(

4.<<<unclefeezus1>>>
"But when recruiters look at a resume, and see that the person graduated from MIT, the company KNOWS they're getting someone with great problem-solving skills and a mindset that will contribute to the company."

Lol, and they don't for Stanford? If MIT has an advantage over Stanford, it's very slight.

5.<<<goddess32585>>>
about 1, besides on-campus urops, the boston/cambridge area is full of startups and tech companies, usually by or with alums, that're also possibilities for internships; while physics is a bit tougher, anyone with cs skills doesn't really need to worry, i'd say. silicon valley may in fact have more, but i think there's more than enough in either case, so s'moot.

and for 2, i could point out that if you do find mit to be full of all one sort of people (i don't, but you might) you don't have to look far to find others; i hear boston's a big city, with a lot of schools in it.

6.<<<paulhomework>>>
1) Disagree. MIT's research and internships are unbeatable.

2) Agree

3) Agree

7.<<<molliebatmit>>>
With regards to question 1 -- even if you go to MIT, that doesn't preclude getting a Silicon Valley internship over the summer. (Being an MIT EECS major does tend to open those sorts of doors with ease.) And during the year, I agree with everyone else that MIT's undergraduate research is unparalleled in its ease of access and popularity.

8.<<<stasterisk>>>
I talked to a guy who graduated from my high school in '75 on a flight I had this weekend (talk about meeting cool people randomly on planes). He declined to Stanford, and since left the field he majored in (Math), but he said that unless you stay in the field, Stanford will always have slightly more name-clout than MIT, as many people (laypeople, etc.) will not have heard of or be as familiar with MIT. If you know schools, then you will know MIT, but if you don't (and many won't), then Stanford is better for jobs.

9.<<<mercurysquad>>>
[quote]Stanford will always have slightly more name-clout than MIT, as many people (laypeople, etc.) will not have heard of or be as familiar with MIT.[/quote]
Is that so?

In India, EVERYONE knows MIT, but not everyone knows Stanford, or Princeton.. and Yale is virtually unheard-of. :-/

10.<<<magefile>>>
Who doesn't know about MIT? Now, if you said Stanford had more clout in terms of "I have a technical degree but I'm trying to get a non-technical job" or sth. like that, I might agree, but ... seriously, who hasn't heard of MIT?

11.<<<marinarel>>>
I am pretty sure I heard about MIT, Stanford, Berkley, Harvard , Yale when I lived in Russia. So all these names are well known. At least they were back in 1993.

12.<<<paulhomework>>>
The people who will be hiring you will have heard of both MIT and Stanford.

13.<<<stasterisk>>>
keep in mind that the guy was speaking of his own experience, these are not my views. And yes, he was speaking more or less in terms of trying to get jobs that weren't really in the field he studied. He wasn't very clear about this, but I guess it could be "non technical job w/technical degree"

It might be true that the "layperson" doesn't know MIT as well as Stanford, but when applying for jobs, those employers will defiantly know! (Assuming you're not applying to be a McDonalds manger or the like)


No one can actually sit down an quantify which school has a better reputation...when it comes down to jobs and internships its going to be a matter of who the person is, not what school they're from.

15.<<<goddess32585>>>
on a reverse twist from the "getting a non-technical job with a technical degree", i'll toss in a data point about a friend who graduated last year with a degree in creative writing and then got a job as a sysadmin.

16.<<<mercurysquad>>>

17.<<<wellesleygirl>>>
also about Stanford vs. MIT: which has better biology/music/international relations programs?

18.<<<sakky>>>
My answers to the OP:

1) Uncertain. I think this really depends on the individual's personality - just how aggressive a person is in getting opportunities. In any case, I see the difference as being so small as to be negligible.

2) Agree

3) Agree

19.<<<An0nym0u5>>>
These schools are so different in terms of atmosphere that these questions are very irrelevant. The choice should vary from person to person. Both have an adequate reputation, so choice should be based on visiting and getting a "feel" of each place. Because if you like the atmosphere better, you will likely be happier, which helps in terms of doing better academically. And thats important because you know its grad school which is more important that undergrad.

And all of my relatives in India have heard of Princeton and MIT according to my parents. I'm not saying they haven't heard of Stanford, they never said they haven't.

20.<<<sakky>>>
I would also say that if you just want to go to a school that people around the world have heard of (which is not a particularly good reason to choose a program), then forget about both MIT and Stanford. Go to Harvard.

21.<<<An0nym0u5>>>
^^ screw harvard, go to oxford.

22.<<<goddess32585>>>
um. i don't think we have anything that really resembles an international relations program (it may be v. small or masquerading as something v. different, but i doubt it) music is actually the most popular minor here, since so many people come in with experience, but i don't have any personal experience with it.

23.<<<athena_wiles>>>
An0nym0u5 ~ harvard, oxford, yale, it's all basically the same. i turned down oxford in favor of yale last year, and i haven't really seen much in the way of a name-recognition difference between the two schools...

(same goes for MIT &amp; Stanford... talking to my overseas friends, the name recognition on those two isn't <i>quite</i> as quick/immediate as for HYP &amp; oxbridge, but they're still *definitely* recognized as top-tier universities :-P)

24.<<<An0nym0u5>>>
we wuz talking about international name-recognition. to be honest i cant stand the british accent.

25.<<<athena_wiles>>>
i actually did mean international name-recognition. at least, with my friends &amp; other contacts in germany and the UK. i'm sure it's different in other countries, though :-P

26.<<<JHB619>>>
so how powerful of a name recognition does MIT and Stanford have internationally compared to Harvard?

27.<<<mia305>>>
You would be surprised. Outside of the academic/scientific communities there are MANY folks who have heard of Stanford but have no idea what MIT is. Maybe it's the sports thing. Which brings me to the main point to this thread.

Stanford is a complete university with arts and social science programs on an equal footing, at the least, with engineering and science; with professional schools (med and law) that MIT doesnt have and no shortage of pre laws and premeds; and with a more typical, and full, college experience including intercollegiate sports. MIT excels at what it chooses to do. It's great but not for everyone. Stanford has a better financial aid program for middle income kids. It is west coast centric. MIT is probably better for low income applicants. It seems to gear its finaid to low income applicants and seems to view providing for this group as a particular mission.

Cross admits break about 50-50.

28.<<<skysk>>>
MIT may not provide a "typical" college experience, but it certainly provides a full one. Obviously, it's focused on those who have an interest in science/engineering. However, it's misleading to imply that MIT is UNLIKE Stanford in that it does NOT have sports or strong arts, humanities, and social science programs.

MIT has something like 40 varsity sports and an extremely high rate of participation in these sports. They're well-funded programs and provide an extra dimension to life at MIT, a place which is often stereotyped as being "nerdy." MIT doesn't depend on sports for clout with potential applicants or the general public, as Stanford might (aside from it's academic pull), but it is factually incorrect to suggest that Stanford is unlike MIT in that it provides a full college experience including intercollegiate sports. Intercollegiate sports are alive and well at MIT.

Further - MIT is science/engineering focused, but MIT has departments in writing, literature, foreign languages/literatures, history, anthropology, political science, linguistics/philosophy, economics, and a rockin' business school, among others I probably forgot. Of course MIT is a "complete" university. MIT humanities/social science/arts programs are great, just like Stanford's. The student body is more interested in science/engineering so those departments are larger, which makes sense. MIT also has a bunch of premeds.

But it is true that MIT is not for everyone. If you got in, though, then MIT is a good place for you.

29.<<<Mikalye>>>
[quote]Stanford is a complete university with arts and social science programs on an equal footing, at the least, with engineering and science;[/quote]
Agreed, MIT's programs in the humanities are not of the same standard as their offerings in Engineering. That is not to say they aren't excellent, they are, and if you choose to be one of the very small number of (say) English Literature majors at MIT, then you get a level of individualised care not possible in EECS, but they are not generally on an equal footing with Engineering and Science.
[quote]with professional schools (med and law) that MIT doesnt have and no shortage of pre laws and premeds[/quote]
Almost agreed. 10% of an MIT undergraduate class goes on to medical school, 5% go on to law school. I believe that MIT too has no shortage of prelaws and premeds. Both have top 10 ranked business schools, though MIT's is arguably more involved in undergraduate education than Stanford's. There is no denying that MIT does not have a law school or a medical school, but I'm not sure that that matters as much for undergraduate education, particularly as MIT both offers classes in law and offers full cross-registration with Harvard a mile up the road. I was not pre-med, but while at MIT, I got a job in a lab attached to the Harvard Medical School in Boston. I don't think that MIT not having a medical school matters so much given the resources that pre-meds have at MIT.
[quote]and with a more typical[/quote]
Agreed
[quote]and full, college experience[/quote]
Disagree Completely
[quote]including intercollegiate sports.[/quote]
MIT last year fielded more NCAA intercollegiate teams than Stanford, albeit mostly in Division III. MIT also offers a more participatory intramural sports program (more than 75% of students take part) than most other schools including Stanford. What an NCAA division I school offers is the whole communal gathering at the Sports stadium, something that doesn't happen in the same way at MIT, but if you are interested in playing as opposed to watching sport, then MIT is probably superior to Stanford for most students.

If you are saying that MIT guarantees to meet full financial need for all students for 4 years and Stanford does not, then certainly this makes sense. Apart from that, I am not certain that this is true.

30.<<<mia305>>>
Mikalye:
Re finaid: MIT is better for low incomes. It is free (tuition room board travel etc)for family incomes less than 75k and doubles Pell grants. For low incomes, Stanford is free for incomes less than 60k. For higher incomes, however, Stanford, unlike MIT, has a policy of being tuition free for incomes up to 100k (and it also caps assessment of student assets at 5 instead of 25%, caps home equity, divides parental contribution by number of kids in college, among other benefits). I am not going to get into anecdotal evidence as well. Suffice it to say that I disagree with your disagreement as to which is better for which income group.

Re sports and the college experience: For starters there's a huge difference between Stanford sports and MIT's DIII efforts. I appreciate MIT's efforts; it's just not the same thing and the experience is undeniably different. Moreover, it's such an obvious and significant difference that it is unclear what you are arguing over. Stanford I believe is second to MIT in the breadth of its sports offerings. However, at Stanford, unlike MIT, the major sports amount to social events and alums continue to follow Stanford sports well after graduation. Hell, the games are even televised. At MIT there will be no rooting for the alma mater in the annual NCAA basketball tournament and office pool. Additionally, having a community that includes a majority of non-science types, definitionally makes for a more typical college experience. I am not being critical of MIT. I greatly appreciate it for what it chooses to be. It is more narrowly focussed and, to me that is one of its strengths. But it is CLEARLY different and atypical.

Personally, i prefer MIT but it is not for everyone.

Hmmm...rankings for English, history, or sociology...etc?

33.<<<CalAlum>>>
@ Sam Lee,
I'm not aware of any national or international rankings of specific undergraduate major programs. The Social Science Library of the University of Illinois maintains a website with links to angencies providing rankings, and as you can see, undergraduate majors like English, sociology, history, etc. do not appear: <a href="http://www.library.uiuc.edu/edx/rankgen.htm" rel="nofollow">College Rankings: General and Undergraduate, Education and Social Science Library, U of I</a>.

Stanford and MIT are vastly different. I've taught at Stanford as a guest professor, and my daughter is now a sophomore at MIT, so I have some experience with both institutions. I'm not sure the typical MIT student would be happy at Stanford, where the major science buildings are off to the side of the campus. I've heard some Stanford science majors talk about feeling somewhat marginalized on a campus that aggressively recruits and admits athletes, legacies, and faculty offspring.

My son, a high-school junior who dislikes math and science, would be quite happy at Stanford. But my daughter, who always longed to find a critical mass of others who loved science and math as much as she did, would have been pretty miserable. She took to MIT like a duck to water.

If you're admitted to both places, be sure to visit. The differences are like night and day.

34.<<<WaterIntoAcids>>>
Wow, CalAlum, that was an incredibly insightful response. I have only just visited the two campuses, but even from those experiences I gained to very different perspectives. Stanford, to me, felt very "country-clubbish," what you describe as "athletes, legacies, and faculty offspring." I simply could not picture myself there for four years, even with the world renowned science and math departments. I did, however, fall in love with MIT the moment I toured the campus and saw students discussing problem sets, eating donuts, and just plain having fun. There was this nonchalance and humor behind the "drinking water from the firehose" academics that just captivated me. No negative comment on Stanford at all, just didnt seem right for me.

35.<<<prime235>>>
yea. the culture is wayy different. if your a sci/math person you'll feel at home at MIT.

mmhm, well said.

36.<<<oasis>>>
I was admitted to both Stanford and MIT back in 07 and I pretty much decided on whim that I was going to come to MIT. (ok, this is somewhat of an exaggeration, but I felt I would have been pretty happy at both Stanford and MIT)

I'm not going to comment on the social/intellectual aspects of either campus because I think this point had been debated over and over again in the Stanford v. MIT threads and I won't repeat many of the things that were said.

However, I did visit Stanford for my very first time this October and I really felt happy that I decided to come to MIT after visiting Stanford.

Location / campus is a BIG factor for me, and although this seems kind of shallow I must admit that this was a key issue when I decided on colleges before. I'm a firm believer that even the school is absolutely-omgosh wonderful, if it's in the middle of nowhere, I'm probably not going to enjoy it regardless (I'm too used to city life and having a city to explore from living in Asia).

Stanford is truly like a country-club, and another thing that gets me is that the campus is SO BIG! After coming back from Stanford, I ask myself why people even need bikes at MIT lol. Although the campus is pretty and all, the great space between buildings and dorms kind of turned me off. I really enjoy the fact that MIT's pretty connected and you can access all the main group buildings even by tunnel when it's snowing out.

Moreover, Boston's just a stone's throw away from MIT, and the Charles River is absolutely gorgeous in the summer/fall. Stanford? San Fran is quite a ways away by train, and Palo Alto's too far to walk to on a consistent basis (biking is reasonable, or by car). I would say that the only things that Stanford definitely trumps MIT on in terms of locale is its awesome architecture and nice weather. But other than that, I've grown to love living in Boston and even the ease of access to so many other colleges (and their students) like Harvard, BU, BC, Tufts, Wellesley...etc. What does Stanford have? Just Cal.

Oh but they do have better Chinese food ;)

39.<<<datalook>>>
Q1: Perhaps MIT does have a more prestigious programs in CS and physics. However, I feel that there would be more research and internship opportunities at Stanford because of its location in the Silicon Valley.

Disagree.

Stanford is better in CS. For CS, Stanford>Berkeley=MIT=CMU.
1) Stanford people have won more Turing awards.
2) Stanford CS has been ranked as #1 by US NEWS, and National research council for several decades.
3) Stanford people have founded HP, YAHOO, Google, Sun, Silicon graphics, and etc.
4) Stanford people have created a lot of milestone inventions in IT, at least more so than MIT.
To summarize, Stanford is THE king in CS.

For physics, Stanford=MIT=Berkeley=Caltech=Harvard=Princeton

41.<<<oasis>>>
datalook is back! O___O

42.<<<VictoryCoorg>>>
Some time has passed since the last discussion in this old thread. I would appreciate current opinions on MIT vs Stanford for Maths &amp; Computer Science.

A couple of other angles that I am especially interested in :

(1) Is it kind of true that MIT is more of a pressure-cooker kind of environment with lots of intensely academic people which can sometimes lead to unhealthy competition and pressures?

(2) For a family with high assets (in stocks) and low income, which is likely to give greater financial aid?

(3) If one definitely wants to go on to Ph.D. program after undergraduate studies, which one would be better?

Thanks.

43.<<<Mikalye>>>
1) Definitely not true of MIT. Indeed, MIT does a great deal to reduce pressures. The reason that your first term is pass-fail is to reduce the pressure on acclimatising students. There are also no classes of degrees at MIT. You cannot graduate from MIT "summa cum laude" for example. You either have an MIT degree or you do not. Indeed, as has been discussed on this board before, many problem sets are designed to be done in groups. This is not calculated to build pressure. From my observation, almost all of the pressure at MIT was generated from within, with students striving to excel, but MIT goes out of its way to avoid a "pressure-cooker" environment.

2) It's totally unclear. FA is calculated differently at different schools. Stamford has a few features in its FA, that are very different from MIT. For example, MIT guarantees to meet a student's full financial need for all for years for all students including international students. MIT also operates need-blind admissions for all students, including international students. Stamford does not. That being said, because Stamford does not make these expensive promises to international students they might or might not make you a more generous offer. Also, all of MIT's FA is need-based. MIT does not consider any factor in determining aid apart from ability to pay. By contrast, although most of Stamford's FA is need-based, a portion of it is also merit-based. Again, your mileage may vary.

3) What gets you into a PhD program is evidence of skill at research. This is true whether your field is biochemistry or renaissance literature. I would put MIT's UROP program at the top of the tree when it comes to undergraduate research opportunities. But at either institution, you should have opportunities to get involved in real research if a PhD is your ultimate goal.

44.<<<MITChris>>>
honestly this is a stupid thread.

the two schools have very little in common aside from being elite academic institutions.

which one is 'better' depends entirely on the individual student and the community to which they would prefer to belong.

that answer is going to be different for every single student.

45.<<<GandalfTheGreat>>>
Actually, I don't think this thread is stupid. If it is about discussing which is "better" in a general sense, then, I agree that it depends on the individual and there is really no clear answer. Instead, I take the purpose of this thread to be seeking information about, and discuss, what the differences between the two schools are. That kind of information can help someone decide which might be a better fit for that person.

That said, let me come to issue 3 above regarding someone who is sure about pursuing Ph.D. after undergrad: As I understand, at Stanford (at least in CS), one directly moves to the PhD program after B.S., but, at MIT, one will have to do a Masters thesis along the way. Right? Does that mean the total time from undergrad to PhD will in general be longer at MIT?

46.<<<mathboy98>>>
Huh? Pretty sure you do not need a master's to be accepted to the MIT EECS PhD program. If a master's thesis is required en route to PhD, it does not imply a longer time. That would be like saying doing an undergrad thesis means graduating later or so.

Remark - working in groups can make someone feel dumb if everyone else is more competent at the task at hand. Can...not should.


Also honestly these are both tops in CS. Asking whether there is grade deflation is better than asking which has a hard workload. Obviously they will both be extremely serious programs.

47.<<<molliebatmit>>>
[quote]As I understand, at Stanford (at least in CS), one directly moves to the PhD program after B.S., but, at MIT, one will have to do a Masters thesis along the way. Right? Does that mean the total time from undergrad to PhD will in general be longer at MIT?[/quote]
Very broadly speaking, most PhD programs are constructed as ~2-year master's programs with ~4-year PhD programs following. Some schools don't go so far as to actually award the master's degree, but just have a ~6-year PhD program. It all works out in the wash.

Factors like personal motivation, choice of advisor, and research project will have a much greater effect on time to PhD than the program will.

Also, AFAIK both MIT and Stanford offer five-year co-terminal bachelor's/master's programs for EECS undergrads.

EDIT: It is, though, significantly putting the cart before the horse to think about Stanford vs. MIT for undergrad based on the policies of the respective PhD programs. Both schools will provide an excellent springboard for graduate studies; there's no need to pick one school and stay there through the PhD unless you want to. There are plenty of Stanford undergrads at MIT for graduate school and vice versa.

48.<<<mathboy98>>>
[quote]Both schools will provide an excellent springboard for graduate studies;[/quote]

To put the following twist -- these are top PhD programs, and the criteria for getting into undergrad and graduate school are different, whence one can hardly count on it. Unless a star, in which case either school will serve fine.

Research experience is hugely important for many CS programs, but I can't imagine either of these schools being bad for that, and I think despite the subtle differences in CS, grad program structure, etc, as MITChris says, there might be more meaningful considerations, given they're two very different places that can give top opportunity.
[quote]AFAIK both MIT and Stanford offer five-year co-terminal[/quote]

Two things:

1) I learned something new, that AFAIK = As far as I know

2) I assume Mollie is sure MIT does, and Stanford definitely does offer such a degree too.

49.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Yes, I'm sure MIT does. :) And I knew Stanford had co-terminal masters in some fields, but didn't know whether EECS was one of them.

50.<<<mathboy98>>>
They don't have a separate program called EECS, but rather in EE and CS separately, so that's one difference -- those guys have a coterminal master's option.

51.<<<GandalfTheGreat>>>
Reading through another thread on CC, I came to know that in at least engineering disciplines, a significant portion of the grad students at MIT are from MIT's undergrad programs and there is some amount of preference at MIT for their own undergrads when it comes to grad program admissions. Is a similar preference present at Stanford as well for Stanford undergrads?

52.<<<LNSebastian>>>
Hi, I was accepted to Stanford (my first choice) EA and decided not to apply to MIT (my second choice). I have another friend who is applying to both RD, and whose first choice is MIT.

I feel that MIT would have given me a [marginally] better education than Stanford, but I would be happier at Stanford. Isn't your quality of life also an important consideration? I love the location, the people, and most of all the band at Stanford. I don't think I would have been as successful in the ultra-competitive environment at MIT.

plus, I'm not interested in engineering- just plain old molecular biology. I think there are fewer people at MIT doing pure science than engineering, but the ratio is reversed at Stanford.

Sometimes I feel like I made the wrong decision, mostly because Stanford is going to make me do a bunch of pointless humanities. Oh well, it's too late now.

53.<<<k4r3n2>>>
[quote]I don't think I would have been as successful in the ultra-competitive environment at MIT.[/quote]

I probably wouldn't either. Good thing an ultra-competitive environment doesn't exist at MIT.

Stanford is a great place, and I'm sure you'll be happy and do well there.

Just to correct a minor misapprehension:
[quote]plus, I'm not interested in engineering- just plain old molecular biology. I think there are fewer people at MIT doing pure science than engineering, but the ratio is reversed at Stanford.[/quote]
There are fewer people majoring in science at MIT than those majoring in engineering, but there are still plenty of pure scientists -- the School of Science awarded 378 degrees in 2008 (out of 1217 degrees awarded total). So a little more than a third of MIT students get a degree in a pure science field (because there are only ~1050 students per class).

MIT is really great for both engineering and for pure science. Even for plain old molecular biology majors (like me).

55.<<<mathboy98>>>
Yeah, nobody should make the mistake of thinking MIT is only strong in applied fields. Sure, the undergrads may gravitate towards it, but for instance their pure math should make most any enthusiast drool. Not to perpetuate stereotypes that may or may not exist about such enthusiasts of course....

56.<<<GandalfTheGreat>>>
LNSebstian said above : "Sometimes I feel like I made the wrong decision, mostly because Stanford is going to make me do a bunch of pointless humanities. Oh well, it's too late now ".

From the point of view having to take humanities courses, is there really any difference between MIT and Stanford? My understanding is that you will have to take them at MIT as well.

57.<<<faraday>>>
One thing that might help specifically about question 2:

At MIT, the "hacker" mentality in EECS is especially common. If you like hacker culture, dang, you'll probably love it here. BTW, By hacking, I mean something much more broad than computer security.

58.<<<PiperXP>>>
^ I'll note that people-who-break-into-secure-computer-systems are called "crackers", not "hackers". A hacker is, broadly speaking, just someone who programs - not necessarily for dark purposes ^^

To increase confusion, people who go around exploring campus and pulling clever pranks are also called hackers.

59.<<<ielizabeth>>>
Stanford is great,but it can't compete with MIT.MIT is the PERFECT engineering school.

60.<<<phantasmagoric>>>
^ If it can't compete with MIT, why do all the NRC rankings--old and new--show that Stanford and MIT are neck-and-neck in most engineering disciplines, among many other science disciplines? Not to mention every other ranking of engineering. ;)

61.<<<datalook>>>
It's older and bigger. Nothing else.


MIT has 370 faculty members in engineering, while Stanford has 240.

MIT has 110 faculty in national academy of engineering, while stanford has 92.

MIT is ranked #1 by usnews, while Stanford is #2

In the National research ranking released in 2010, Stanford ranks better than MIT in computer science, electrical engineering, industrial engineering/operations research, and Aerospace engineering.

MIT wins in chemecal engineering, civil engineering, material engineering, and biomedical engineering.

For mechanical engineering, MIT is better in R-rank. Stanford is better in S-rank.

Stanford's Bio-engineering is not ranked because when NRC collected data in 2005. That department was only 2 years old and no sufficient data available at that time.

62.<<<datalook>>>
By the way, MIT is great. But thinking it is a perfect engineering school is wrong.

FYI, I have been taking classes from MIT CSAIL. Those courses are great, very challenging and stimulating. But still, I sometimes wonder what if I am attending classes from Stanford.

^^ actually for civil engineering, it's the same as ME: MIT is better for R-rank, Stanford for S-rank. In fact, after glancing at the different engineering rankings, I think that if someone did the analysis in the new NRC rankings, they might find that Stanford pulls ahead of MIT overall in engineering.

Are you an MIT student? Otherwise, how would you be taking classes from MIT CSAIL?

^^^ Possibly via OCW.

Stanford rejected me EA. My MIT interviewer was cool, and I'm awaiting a decision. So far MIT wins. :)

Kidding aside, this is a neat thread!

67.<<<InternAtUSA>>>
I have some questions, as I am accepted to both and desire to study engineering:
1. Will the harder problem sets at MIT make me think more creatively (i.e. make me a better "innovative" engineer)?
2. Squash is my passion. Stanford only has a club for men, while MIT has it as a varsity. Is a division iii varsity > Stanford's club?
3. Which school is it easier to double major in (I want bioengineering, with a double major in EE/biolgoy/ comupter science / or pilitical science)?
4. Which school requires MORE humanities? (i.e. higher percentage of curriculum)?
thx in advance.

68.<<<phantasmagoric>>>
InternAtUSA,

1. I doubt it--both MIT and Stanford are the two best schools for engineering.
2. I think that depends on how seriously you want to pursue squash. Do you want to be on a varsity team? The club team at Stanford also plays other teams.
3. Not sure which one is easier, but a few things: Stanford is on the quarter system, so you'll have the opportunity to take more classes. You'll also be able to design your own major (Stanford encourages interdisciplinary study). Double majoring with two sciences or engineering+social science is rather common.
4. Not sure which has more, but Stanford currently requires 3 introductory humanities classes, plus another class satisfying the humanities distribution requirement. This might not matter to you, since Stanford's also doing an overhaul of the undergraduate curriculum (the main change being fewer requirements), so it's likely to change soon.

(By the way, I'm finishing at Stanford now and might be attending MIT for PhD)

It's reasonably common to double-major at MIT -- you just need to complete the required courses for two majors, and if they have overlapping requirements, you can count those courses toward both majors.

You might be interested in the new course 6-7 biology/EECS joint major (info <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/V131/N21/bioeecs.major.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>), which might eliminate the need to double-major given your interests. With this program, you would take courses both in biology and EECS, and would have an advisor in each department.
[quote]Which school requires MORE humanities? (i.e. higher percentage of curriculum)?[/quote]
MIT requires eight courses in the humanities, arts, and social sciences.

phantasmagoric,
I still didn't get you. I may want to play squash on a serious team. Can one say that a club at Stanford is equivalent to an MIT's varsity team? and how does the quarter system help (you mean it's easier to get grades)?

Also, for waht you and molliebatmit say, do you mean that one takes more humanities at MIT?

thx both!

sure MIT may have a lot of different things like business school and political science and they do have sports teams, but how often do you ask someone where they got there business degree from and they say MIT. MIT has its prestigious reputation in science and engineering. Stanford has more of a well rounded reputation

I have always been attracted to MIT's rigorous curriculum,but i am interested in creating a startup oneday and Stanford wins in startup culture to the best of my knowledge.

This is very, very, very wrong. According to US News &amp; WR (Yes, I know there methodology may well be flawed). The top 3 business schools in the US today are Harvard, Stanford and MIT. I know heaps of people who are very proud that they got their MBA at MIT.

That is not to say that their is anything at all wrong with Stanford. It is a superb school, and may well be a great choice. There is no such thing as a "best" school, though there may be a "best" school for any individual student. There are certainly a wide variety of things that Stanford can offer that MIT cannot (such as a heaving stadium of people cheering on the Division I football team). However, to suggest that MIT's business school is not up to scratch is very much mistaken.

74.<<<EngineerEng>>>
I had to make that choice one day, i picked MIT for the start-up culture. Here's a short analysis:
1-Boston is the best place for biotechnology investment.
2-MIT lets its undergrads take business classes in Sloan, Stanford less so.
3-MIT offers many contests for start-ups that undergrads are allowed to participate in, such as seed grants and 100K contest and many many many many others. you will keep on receiving emails of business contests and mixers when ur in MIT.
4- MIT alumni founded 26000 companies, Stanford 4500.
5-Stanford produced google, sun, cisco, and yahoo. MIT produced Koch industries, Intel, Raytheon, akamai, and mcdonnel douglas. All of these are/were multibillionaire companies, and each was a leader in its field. Yet, while Stanford only produced famous CS companies, MIT produced more diverse business leaders (Koch for chemical, intel for electrics, mcdonnel for planes, now it merged with beoing, raytheon for weapons...)
6- Many MIT classes encourage entrepreneurship, and even after classes sometimes groups may proceed with their ideas.
7-More room for innovation in mIT due to more engineers and hardcore nerds who are ready to work really hard.
8- Silicon Valley remains the top CS hub.
9-MIT undergrad course 15 major is seen as the second best undergrad business degree in the US after Wharton, significantly ahead of stanford. For grad, the consensus is that they are almost equal but Stanford takes a slight edge (although i have seen rankings placing MIT higher for grad, such as ARWU ranking and QS for grad finance and administration)
10. MIT Sloan has the widest range of electives of any school and has more number 1 ranked programs than other business school in the world (supply chains and informatix, logistics, production operations). Both QS and US News attest to that, and from my experience the consensus seems to be that.
11. MIT students to think more ahead of their time... they truly believe in science

hope that helps
