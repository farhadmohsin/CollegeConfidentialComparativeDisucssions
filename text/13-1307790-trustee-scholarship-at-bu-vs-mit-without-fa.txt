My dilemma: I got in to MIT, but with minimal financial aid (I'll basically have to pay everything). I've also received a full tuition scholarship at BU through the Trustee scholarship, and full tuition at Northeastern for being an NMF. My parents have said they will pay for about half of MIT. I plan on majoring in physics, and most likely going to grad school later. I'd love to hear opinions from MIT grads: is it worth going into $100k of debt for an MIT undergrad education, or should I take one of the other offers?

2.<<<iceui2>>>
If your family could afford it, I think you should definitely choose MIT. You are looking at the BEST physics program in the world - you can easily make the money back in the future with a MIT education. On the other hand, you won't have another opportunity to be a MIT student again. So come to CPW and see if you like it. If you do, don't make cost your most significant factor in your decision because at the end of the day, you cannot put a price on a MIT education.

[quote]most likely going to grad school later[/quote]
Just so you're aware (many rising college freshmen aren't), grad school in the sciences is supported completely by the PhD programs themselves, generally through federal grants. Grad school in physics will not cost you anything, and, indeed, you will be supported by a stipend while in graduate school.

So $100k is serious debt to go into for your undergraduate education, but you can be confident that you will not need to go further into debt to finance your graduate work.

4.<<<cellardweller>>>
You situation is fairly common among MIT applicants. Many are offered scholarships at state schools or other private colleges. But in the end, very few turn down the opportunity of an MIT education.

Your opportunities on graduation from MIT will be vastly greater than from nearly any other school in the country, especially if you want to pursue grad school in the sciences. Getting into a top PhD program is essential and while theoretically possible from any college or university, the likelihood is much greater with an MIT degree. If you decide for any reason not to pursue graduate school it is also much easier to get a well paying job with an MIT degree, whatever your major. The $100K investment you would make by attending MIT could be the wisest investment you will ever make.

5.<<<texaspg>>>
Taking on 100k debt if you are planning to move from undergrad to grad school is a tough choice.

Are your parents willing to sign the loan papers with you? On your own you can only borrow 5.5k each year from what I see in other threads.

6.<<<cptofthehouse>>>
This depends on so much. Will your family be able to support you on this? Friends of ours did this, and regretted it because as an engineering major at MIT, he made exactly what the kids from StateUs were getting and he had loans to repay, and family that was in dire financial straits that could not help and were hitting him up for money as soon as he was making what they felt was a fortune. His sister appealed for help for him for her own college. It was a tough going for him. Had he gone to state U, he would not have had all of those years of loan payments, and that was 30 years ago when the debt is a lot less since costs were less. $100K is a lot of money to owe and physicists do not usually make a whole lot of money. You will only be able to borrow $5500 yourself freshman year, so how are you thinking of getting the rest? Will your parents cosign? Can they co sign? Are they even credit worthy? MIT might be a wise investment to make, but to borrow to invest is not advised in any investment scheme.

7.<<<itsme123>>>
the choice is simple. MIT is great if you're looking into getting a job after graduation. but for grad school, i think MIT isn't that much of an asset, assuming you will do well at BU and participate in research. (no knock down on MIT, that's a great place). Sure, your future grad school will accept somewhat lower gpa from mit than from say BU and Northeastern, and then again, your chances of doing well at BU is much higher, and it's almost fail-safe. again, if you're sure of going to grad school, BU will be just fine, and may even be a better choice -- you can go to grad school at MIT or anywhere else you want. your chances will not be lower. a sub-par gpa from mit will not get you into top grad school. take a look at grad students at MIT and other top school, not all are from MIT or pother top schools. there are so many from average schools such as K-state, LSU, UCI etc. BU is much better. so, why pay 100k, and take that risk. go look at faculty at top schools where they studied undergrad -- not all come from a top undergrad school, but most from a top grad school. so in essence it's the terminal degree that matters, especially so in your case. save your $, and focus on doing well at BU and get involved in research -- which should be a no-brainer as a trustee scholar.

8.<<<cellardweller>>>
It is just nonsense that the odds are the same for the average grad at State U to get into a top PhD program compared to an MIT grad. Look at the baccalaureate origins of grad students at MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Princeton or Caltech. The overwhelming majority came from top undegraduate programs. Recommendations are key for access to top grad programs and the professors at top research universities all know each other and typically accept students from programs they are familiar with. Sure, it is possible to get into a top program from other schools but the odds are very low. The vast majority of MIT undergrads get into top grad programs, first and foremost at MIT itself, which has the top ranked physics PhD program in the country. I don't believe there is a single BU student in the program.

As far as jobs directy out of school, it is like day and night between MIT and even a good science/engineering school as far as career opportunities. Most recent science/engineering grads can't even find a job, let alone one that pays a decent salary. The top employers that recruit on the MIT campus don't even recruit at most colleges so the opportunities are nowehere near the same. Furthermore starting salaries for MIT grads are significantly higher as all recruiting stastistics bear out. According to the most recent student exit surveys, the average salary of a graduating student from MIT with a BS is $74,000 including bonus, far more than the national average. For those with a MS or MEng the average starting salary is closer to $100,000. For EECS grads starting salaries can be as high as $130,000. Even science majors make much more than the national average. Physics majors average $70,000 starting salaries, 50% more than the national average.

As an MIT graduate, you also have options virtually non-existent elsewhere for engineers/scientists such as consulting, IB, or joining hot startups. Where else could you get a job at Morgan Stanley or Bain &amp; Co. as a physics major straight out of college?

9.<<<CalAlum>>>
This is a tough decision, and ultimately, it's a decision you have to make collaboratively with your parents. In our family, the decision was resolved as a result of a visit to CPW. My daughter's father went along, and because he was the holdout, that made all the difference.

Posters here are right: every student admitted to MIT receives multiple offers from other places, and some of those offers come with massive amounts of merit aid, sometimes up to full tuition. That was true in our case also.

We ended up choosing to pay full freight for our daughter to attend MIT, and this decision was largely based on the opportunities she would have as a student. We were not disappointed. As a student at MIT, you'll have the chance to engage in research through the UROP program, and that experience can be either for pay, or for credit. Our daughter was extremely frugal. She lived in a dorm with a kitchen, and she went after a UROP every year at MIT (not for the money, as it turns out, but because she loved research), and in the end, those decisions probably saved us around $30,000 overall.

She was a physics major, and as Mollie has told you, physics graduate students receive offers that range from covering all tuition plus a decent stipend to everything covered plus a good living wage. She worked during her summer after graduation and is now into spring semester of her first year of grad school at Harvard. I was in Boston just this week on business, and she told me she's been able to save money. So perhaps you can not only attend graduate school, but begin to pay down some undergraduate debt as well.

There's a risk with every decision. Good luck!

[quote]CalAlum wrote: So perhaps you can not only attend graduate school, but begin to pay down some undergraduate debt as well.[/quote]
To add to this, I have been able to pay off almost all of my undergraduate debt so far in graduate school.

And for the record, I agree that, for me, having attended MIT (and having participated in significant research in the lab of a world-class professor) was a major factor in my acceptance to top graduate programs in my field, including the one I currently attend. I do not flatter myself and think that I could have gotten in from anywhere.

11.<<<cptofthehouse>>>
If your parents are going to pay for half of MIT, that is about $28K they will pay each year. Where are you going to get the other half? You will qualify for loans of a big fat $5500 freshman year from the federal government, but anyplace else your parents will have to step in and at least cosign the loans. In most cases it will be cheaper for them to take out the loans themselves. You will have over $100K in debt upon getting your UG degree with interest clicking away at it. Do the actual numbers yourself.

12.<<<moonman676>>>
Perhaps try to take a gap year and get a job to pay off some of that debt "in advance".

13.<<<WhaleWhale>>>
Would you rather be the head of a chicken (though BU is probably better than a chicken), or the down of a phoenix? Yes, there are a lot more opportunities at MIT, but there are going to be opportunities at BU as well.

IMO, if you are sure that you want to go into grad school, there isn't too much of a point of going to MIT, especially if you have a lot of debt. Most employers place more weight on your last degree than your first. If you actively try to find opportunities at BU and work hard, you shouldn't have too much of a problem getting into an amazing grad school.

14.<<<PiperXP>>>
^ Grad schools also place a lot of weight on your last degree.

Take the full ride. Unless you have a very huge knack for Physics (massively accelerated, stellar high school research, competitions like IPhO) and Math (accelerated, high competition placing, etc..) to the point where you will run out of resources at BU or Northeastern or have tremendously diminishing gains on them compared to MIT, you difference in undergraduate education at MIT or the others will not be that different. I concede you'll probably have to go out of your way to make yourself stand out/go the extra mile to an extent to become a competitive applicant to a top notch Physics grad school if you go to BU or Northeastern, but at least you and the fam. can be happy knowing you will be debt free. You'll have to time to concentrate on Physics or whatever you love instead of working.

To the naysayers who point out MIT high straight outta college salaries, if ChadBro is intent on going to grad school, I don't think that data will help swing his vote, sorry.

MIT give better financial aid kthxbai

[quote]You'll have to time to concentrate on Physics or whatever you love instead of working.[/quote]
At MIT, it's typical for undergraduate research jobs to be paid, so it's quite possible to concentrate on physics <i>while</i> working.

I am someone who paid for a significant amount of her own MIT education (I will end up having paid a little over a year's worth myself, and my parents paid a total of about two years), and did so while attending graduate school in the sciences. For me, attending MIT and launching what has so far been a successful academic career was worth the cost.

Wow, where do I start? I completely disagree with this.

If a prospective physics major is trying to decide between MIT and these two schools, the difference in the depth and breadth of the coursework should not be the first consideration, although MIT does take the cake in this regard. For starters, not all physics majors at MIT take tons of graduate courses in physics, believe it or not. Whether a physics major will receive multiple offers from top physics graduate programs will depend, not on the number of advanced courses taken, but on the applicant's demonstrated ability to engage in original and creative research.

What MIT can offer, far above and beyond the other schools, is high-quality research experience. This is not the sort of research experience where the undergraduate joins a lab and sits on the sidelines -- at MIT a student can become a collaborative participant in a research team, and can even be paid to do it.

Yes and No.

There are going to be research opportunities at BU as well. You just have to aggressively try to find them and build good relationships with faculty members. I doubt that MIT undergraduates conduct research that is more novel and advance than BU's professors.

19.<<<cellardweller>>>
As others have pointed it may be even MORE important to consider MIT if grad school is the ultimate plan. The path for PhD candidates to faculty positions and eventual tenure is more competitive than ever. The vast majority of PhD candidates never get there: many simply give up and don't complete their degree, others end up as semi-permanent postdocs and in adjunct faculty positions paying barely more than minimum wage.

In order to get onto a faculty track a top PhD program is absolutely essential. In order to get into a top PhD program, a wlll recognized undergraduate degree with significant research experience is the norm. MIT sends more students to top PhD programs than virtually any school in the country.

You may save some money in the short term by enrolling in a program that offers a lot of merit aid, but may lose out in the long run. The outcomes are simply not the same across all schools. Most studies have shown that in general merit aid incentives don't compensate for loss of economic opportunity.

Before you make a final decision, you should go and visit the schools and their respective physics departments; ask them how many physics majors actually graduate every year and where they end up after graduation and how many are involved in research on campus.

20.<<<cellardweller>>>
[quote]There are going to be research opportunities at BU as well. You just have to aggressively try to find them and build good relationships with faculty members. I doubt that MIT undergraduates conduct research that is more novel and advance than BU's professors.[/quote]

That's not the point. BU professors may do some interesting research but few undergrads participate in it. There is simply no culture of significant involvement in research by undergrads at BU. According to its web site, BU has sponsored a total of 1,500 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programs (UROPs) since 1997 or LESS THAN 100 per year. MIT which invented the UROP back in 1969 sponsors more UROPs in a SINGLE YEAR than BU in 15 years and this with a quarter of the number of undergrads! Research involvement is so imbedded in many departments at MIT that it is part of the core curriculum. That is probably the single most important factor which explains the success of MIT graduates applying to top PhD programs.

21.<<<collegealum314>>>
^You might not be paid, but I think undergrads at BU could do research if they so desired.

22.<<<cellardweller>>>
According to the BU physics department annual report about half of physics majors get involved in some type of research, mostly unpaid and not for credit, at one point or another during their studies. The school has a plan to try to increase that number eventaully to two/thirds. That means half of physics have NO research experience whatsoever. As far UROP experience for credit or pay, it is less than 5%. That would contrast to 100% research participation at MIT for physics majors where it is part of the graduation requirment. In the end what matters for grad school applicants is the significance of the research, not just any type of research.

23.<<<collegealum314>>>
I agree with you that it is much easier to find a paid research position as an undergrad at MIT (or for credit/grades.) This is something which actually may be relevant to the OP, since money is an issue.

The key question with the 50% participation rate in research at BU is whether this is because half the undergrads didn't want to do research or whether they couldn't find a position. I'd imagine there are more people at BU than MIT who don't have an interest in grad school.

24.<<<yzhong94>>>
MIT all the way. In addition to the reasons discussed about, think about the alumni network you will get at MIT. BU simply can't match that.
The friends you meet at MIT will someday become the most prominent figures in their fields. You will not have this kind of relations at BU.

25.<<<cellardweller>>>
Collegealum:

According to BU's physics department annual report the demand for undegraduate research position signficantly outstrips the supply at the current time. In addition, most positions are "volunteers" which is code for doing the grunt work for the grad students. There is a plan to remedy the situation in the future. That is actually very typical. MIT is fairly unique in that undegrads are essentially guaranteed the opportunity to participate in high level research and it is imbedded in the program. As far as getting the opportunity to be a first named author on a research paper, it is pretty much unheard of. For the three years my D was doing research in a big lab in the neuroscience department at MIT she was essentially treated on par with the grad students.

26.<<<collegealum314>>>
[quote]In addition, most positions are "volunteers" which is code for doing the grunt work for the grad students.[/quote]

I don't agree that that is code for grunt work. It just means it is unpaid.

27.<<<catbird>>>
I looked up the CVs of some of Ds' professors -- interesting that many of them did not attend ultra-selective colleges as undergraduates. UNC and Skidmore, for example. Their graduate work, on the other hand, was universally done at top-tier universities.

28.<<<arkbro>>>
the quality of your undergraduate institution means a lot for graduate admissions. it's not like you can just get a 4.0 at a lesser institution and expect to easily get into top grad schools; this is a common misconception on this forum. If you're going to grad school in the sciences, you will probably get a fellowship+stipend, so you won't really have to take on further debt past undergraduate

and like someone else mentioned, the 100 or 200k you might be saving in these four years by not going to MIT is not significant when you take into account the better salary and job opportunities you would most likely have in the future

29.<<<collegealum314>>>
Someone who could get into MIT will probably end up with a very high physics GRE score, so they are likely to do well in graduate admissions. And they are likely to be the ones getting the research positions during undergrad even if not everyone gets one automatically.

If there was an in between choice like Cornell or even UCLA or something like that, I might favor that choice. However, MIT might be the best choice here.

30.<<<cellardweller>>>
[quote]I don't agree that that is code (volunteer) for grunt work. It just means it is unpaid.[/quote]

If it is unpaid and you can't even get credit then it typically is gruntwork. If the research work is of any value you should always be able to get credit for it.

31.<<<collegealum314>>>
[quote]If it is unpaid and you can't even get credit then it typically is gruntwork.[/quote]

What are you basing this on?
[quote]If the research work is of any value you should always be able to get credit for it.[/quote]

Not really. Maybe they don't consider research a class. It's pretty useless to accumulate pass/fail credits anyway.

I strongly disagree with your characterization of unpaid research.

32.<<<cellardweller>>>
My point was not about paid/unpaid research, but whether the work qualifies as <b>original research</b> part of a program of study. If you don't study the prior art, define the hypotheses to be tested, participate in the project definition and have to analyze the results, it is not real research but just lab lab work.

Who says unpaid research is pass/fail? At MIT UROP research, when for credit is fully graded and counts towards both departmental and institute requirements. Results are frequently published.

33.<<<cptofthehouse>>>
This is a family decision as to how the family money is going to be spent. If your parents can comfortably support MIT, I would advise going there. As a mom, I would, in our financial situation, rustle up the funds for MIT. If we were in dire straits or had some immediate issues like we did a few years, ago, I would recommend going with the grant money as it would have been foolish for us to try to pay for a full freight top price college.

34.<<<collegealum314>>>

Again, there is no indication that it is not original research. At MIT and elsewhere, a UROP is what you make it. Most people who start out are given a part of a grad student's project and you learn under them. You read the literature to understand the project, but the most important thing is to gain confidence in your techniques and be able to troubleshoot. I know you are/were in a technical area but I forget if you were involved in a "wet" lab. The so-called grunt work of doing lab techniques and being able to troubleshoot experiments is the hard part of being a grad student. If you are motivated and capable of doing more than that, I think any group or professor would welcome someone taking on more responsibility. I don't think the prof cares about your official status as "for credit" or whatever.

Even at MIT, it would be unusual to actually propose a project as an undergrad; maybe some of the upperclassmen and a few underclassmen can do that, but a lot of people start out doing research way before then, sometimes before they have taken a class in that area. For instance, I interviewed for a P. chem UROP as a freshmen and the prof told me they would just teach me the quantum mechanics necessary on the fly. So obviously the expectation was not that I was going to propose a project off the bat.

35.<<<cellardweller>>>
Again, what really distingues research by undergrads at MIT is:

1. Research is part of the culture and imbedded in the undergraduate curriculum.
2. Original research is conducted by undergrads. It is actually part of the definition of a UROP.
3. in order to get credit you have a to submit an <b>original research plan</b> to be approved by faculty and the department. General lab work does not qualify.
4. it is precisely that type of research experience that gives MIT grads an edge when applying to top grad school program. Any grad student can be expected to learn how to use lab equipment, but few grad students come already trained and able to conduct original research.

If one compares apples to apples, BU undergrads conduct less than 100 UROPs per year in total as opposed to several thousand at MIT, despite a much smaller undergrad population at MIT.

36.<<<collegealum314>>>
^Look, I went to MIT and did UROPs there, so I speak from experience...

37.<<<cellardweller>>>
So did I but it seems that things have vastly changed since that time:
Original research by undergrads is now common.
UROPs done for credit in the department are graded not P/F
UROPs for credit require a research proposal submission.

My D just graduated last summer and every UROP she participated in was based on a specific research proposal to the department and faculty for approval, detailing the objectives of the study, test methodology and proposed analysis. She also did plenty of volunteering in the lab initially that did not qualify as a research project.

38.<<<Hockeydude664>>>
Chadbrochil if you could post your stats that would be helpful.
Secondly, I say MIT unless if you plan on going to grad school such as med school or law school for which you would have to shovel out another 65K/yr.

39.<<<collegealum314>>>
[quote]It seems the rules have clearly changed since that time:
Original research by undergrads is now common.
UROPs done for credit in the department are graded not
P/F
UROPs require a research proposal submission.[/quote]

1) UROPs could be taken for P/F or A-F grading when I was there. UROPs were one method people used to boost their GPA. Other than a few profs, most of the time it wasn't that tough to get an "A" if you put in a good-faith effort.
I suggested that other colleges may not want to do P/F because the credit was inconsequential; they might not also want to do grades for research because it might get abused.

2) It is typical to join a group and to be put on an existing subproject; that's true at MIT, or anywhere. I remember having to write up a "research proposal" (1-2 pgs.) which was reviewed by the prof., not the department. As I said, I was a freshman and working in a group whose area I had not taken classes in yet, so the expectations were that great for the proposal.

With regards to points (1) and (2), I don't see why the for-credit status or the formal requirement for a write-up is particularly meaningful. It's not like if you haven't identified an original direction of research when you joined, that means you will be doing grunt work the whole time. Most of the time it's a process. You interview with a lab, get the job, they give you some papers to review to know your subfield, and you start aquiring techniques, ability to troubleshoot these techniques, presentation skills, and gradually expand your knowledge of the literature (as well as recognize the gaps in the literature from which directions can be pursued.) Whether research is "original" is not black-or-white.

If you are a more advanced student, then you may have more input in the beginning. But again, there is nothing stopping you from having more input in the beginning. Further, there is nothing stopping you from being more involved in your research direction at Boston University either.

You are suggesting that more students do research at MIT, and that the research was more student-driven. OK, well, MIT does get better students to begin with. So even if you accept those premises, it doesn't mean that an interested and talented Boston University student couldn't do the same thing. Association != Causation

The only thing I would say is that BU doesn't have the breadth of different research areas and their recs wouldn't hold the same weight. As to the availability of research positions, if it is true that there is more demand than available positions, wouldn't you think that a guy who got into MIT probably would be able to be one of the ones who got the positions? That is, if only 50% of the students could get research positions, wouldn't you think that an MIT admit would be able to be in the upper half of students at BU?

I saw a blog about an NYU student in chemistry who had been on the U.S. chemistry olympics team. He said that while NYU doesn't have a great chem department and that it is smaller, he got a lot more attention there. He went on to study synthetic organic chem at Harvard for graduate school.

One chem prof at UCLA told me that they are a big school, but that their top students are the same as the top students anywhere even though their student quality has a wide range. One student who worked for him did a lit review, identified a project, completed it over the summer, and wrote up a paper in which he was the 1st author. I doubt that is the expectation there, but I doubt it matters whether there was a formal program or not.

40.<<<collegealum314>>>
BTW, an MIT undergrad physics graduate from '94 just won the Nobel Prize in Physics. He said his research experience was not very valuable though he may have just picked the wrong professor. He did say, however, that Junior Lab really helped him in grad school.

41.<<<underarchiever>>>
It is huge stretch to think that the science in BU is on par with those in MIT. It is nowhere close. I found that the publications by MIT faculty members, even in specialty journals, attract disproportion following and unusual large number of citations. Whereas in BU, is just average at best, unless it is a collaboration with MIT or Harvard faculties. The gap is enormous. Science hiring and graduate student recruitment is largely a function of connection. A graduate from MIT would have a huge leg up on somebody from BU regardless grades or GRE, as far as there are some strong support letters from MIT well known and usually well connected professors. There is no contest. I sat in the graduate admission committee for so many years. It is an unspoken rule to place great weight on references (particularly those references you know personally).

That said, it does not mean graduates from BU having no chance to get into top flight schools. As far as you prove yourselve with research results, strong letters, good GPA and GRE scores, you are still competitive. For MIT graduates, you only need to confirm the expectation. A trip from MIT undergraduate to top flight graduate science schools are equivalent to hit the ball from fairway to green. A trip from BU to top flight schools is equivalent to hit the ball from sideway sand bunker behind the trees to green. It is doable. But it is just a little tougher and it needs more effort.

42.<<<idkmyname>>>
I was in a similar situation last year. I chose MIT, however, I did not need to take on as much debt (~$25k).

In my opinion, if you have the knack for getting to grad school in general, especially if you can get into MIT as an undergrad, you can probably do it from anywhere. I do agree it is "easier" from the MIT side. "Easier" in that more opportunities for you to stand out will present itself as an MIT undergrad. Yet, I put it in quotes because being a physics major at MIT is a difficult task. I presume, if you plan on doing physics in grad school, you are going to want to do Junior Lab (J-lab) for both semesters -- not an easy task by any means. J-lab usually takes on the order of 30 hours per week and the junior year for MIT physics majors is among the most rigorous terms an MIT student can undertake. Making through this difficult process is among the many qualities that grad schools like about MIT undergrads.

On another note, I believe the general culture of MIT students is a unique one -- one that for many people, doesn't work, but for most who choose MIT is the best fit possible. There are enough people with diverse backgrounds at MIT that can allow you to find your social setting, be it partying, building stuff, research, or whatever. And the passion for math and science creates an environment that makes school so much more enjoyable. Given many of the top schools, academically, they are very similar, but what I believe sets MIT apart is it's knack for a science-oriented school. This isn't for everyone, and I encourage you to go to CPW for the purpose of seeing if this is a good fit.

At the same time, 100k in debt is a lot of money. It is so significant that I encourage you to think very carefully at your priorities. Being that much in debt is risky for your future, and as a graduate student, you could very well find yourself in a deep hole of debt.

43.<<<collegealum314>>>
[quote]In my opinion, if you have the knack for getting to grad school in general, especially if you can get into MIT as an undergrad, you can probably do it from anywhere.[/quote]

In terms of getting into grad school alone, the OP should ask him/herself this question: does the prospect of getting a very high GRE score (90%) range sound difficult or easy. If he is confident in his abilities to master the material at BU or elsewhere, it won't be that tough to get that score.

MIT does have more rigorous classes and you will learn more. However, one physics major mentioned to me that she "doesn't have time to think big thoughts." It wasn't really a complaint, just that she was trying to keep her head above water as she was being hosed down by the firehose. If you like to have some time to think about the material on your own, MIT may not be the place.

Also, there are other drawbacks MIT. At BU, it's less likely that you will know someone that committed suicide. Not everyone deals with this the same way. For some people, they just read about it in the newspaper and think "too bad." If you know the person or if it happens in your dorm, it can have a big effect on your outlook.

Frankly, Collegealum, your comments are going from strange to weird. No time to think? Depression? Suicide? What more anecdotes can you pull to turn people off? Jeez, I don't know what MIT did to you lately! Maybe we should both let current MIT students talk about their experiences.

Well, I probably wouldn't have put anything about the suicide thing if there wasn't two recent suicides there in the last 6 months (not counting the last one, which looks like an accidental overdose.) Obviously, they haven't solved this problem. MIT has a reputation for suicide. Everybody knows this. Is it really weird to think that this could have an effect on the campus atmosphere, particularly for those who may have a connection to the person or who lived in the dorm where it happened?

As for the firehose, I hardly think it's bizarre to question whether the sheer quantity of work is a good thing or not. It's called critical thinking. And besides, it was an unsolicited comment from a physics major.

Math55 at Harvard has a killer reputation, yet there was a theoretical math grad student there (and MIT undergrad alum) who wrote a long post explaining that it wouldn't have been good for him to take it when he was an undergrad.

This is ironic, considering you are arguing about what goes on in a UROP at MIT versus other schools, yet you didn't go here. I've done UROPs at MIT and seen and I've overseen undergrad "UROPS" at other schools. I've even seen high school students who were an active participant in their research at their nearby university. You don't need to be at MIT to do this.

But maybe you're right, perhaps someone with second-hand info and an alum 10-years out of MIT should post less on this thread....

[quote]Maybe we should both let current MIT students talk about their experiences.[/quote]

Last semester sucked for me. A lot of my friends got depressed, one left, a few revealed to me that they were depressed and had considered suicide. I was pretty miserable for a bit. I had a few bad relationships. My grades dropped, and my desperate attempts to resuscitate them didn't work. I didn't spend as much time as I wanted at my UROP. I felt unwanted, directionless, and stupid.

The suicides didn't help. A friend of mine was friends with the people who found the body in one case. There was also a constant fear of more suicides, especially since I live in a small, closeknit dorm where everyone knows everyone else. ("Have you seen ___ today?! We haven't seen ___ in, like, the whole day! Guys he's not opening his door. We should call the campus police. OMG OMG OMG did he commit suicide? Are we about to find a body?! Oh. No. He just slept through two exams.") It was pretty terrifying.

47.<<<lidusha>>>
As for UROPs at MIT vs. at other schools. I did research at Penn State in high school, and then did research in the same field at MIT a year later. Labs at MIT are better funded, and publications from these labs are more likely to be published in high-profile journals. It's also much easier for an MIT student to get involved with truly awesome research. However, once you do get a lab and a project, it's harder to get published as an undergrad from MIT, because the quality and quantity of work that is expected of you before publication is usually greater, and the project you will be working on is most likely bigger. You don't really need a publication as an undergrad or even a grad student leaving MIT, though, since a stellar recommendation from an MIT professor who is a leader in the field is worth more than enough.

[quote]yet you didn't go here[/quote]

Where does that come from? True, I was a grad student at MIT and not an undergrad, but I had plenty of undergrads around, some of which I oversaw in the AI lab. Also, the fact that my D just graduated from MIT after spending three years doing research provides me with some very current data.

49.<<<PiperXP>>>
A problem at MIT is that it often attracts the students who decide their worth is directly proportional to their GPA. This is not a healthy outlook anywhere, but can go wrong most drastically at MIT where people will be challenged. It doesn't help that many consider it correct to be "hardcore" and do more than you ever should, often not only academically but hosing yourself with pointless clubs.

With the right mindset, MIT is really a wonderful place full of opportunity. But people have. trouble changing the definition of self-worth that has worked for them for so long, or ignore the peer pressure to be stupidly hosed. It took me way too long to get to that point, but my life's been happy since. I think it was a change I needed to go through.

Well, you do often need a publication as a grad student -- it's a PhD graduation requirement in many programs. :) But it's easier to end up with a publication after four or five years of 60-hour-a-week indentured servitude (ahem, I mean, grad school) than it is after two or three years at fifteen hours a week as an undergrad.

Yep

52.<<<itsme123>>>
^ "vastly greater than ... any other school" is too broad a generalization. i would agree if it was worded as 'greater than ... many schools in some programs.'

remember, there are extremely successful folks in every walk of engineering/other fields who did NOT get their undergraduate degree from MIT. in fact they (i.e., highly successful people) out number MIT graduates easily.

but no matter the hyperbole attached to the opportunities, it's not worth going in debt to the tune of $200 k, especially considering a free-ride at fairly good school like BU per op, especially is grad school is the ultimate motive, again per op.

53.<<<cellardweller>>>

That statement is completely irrelevant to the OP and meaningless. of course, there are more sucessful people in general than MIT grads or Harvard grads or all Ivy grads and top 20 schools grads combined. MIT graduates a very small number of students and that rarity combined with the hardcore reputation of the school is in part what makes it so valuable. While people will often complain that Harvard is overrated, I have frankly never heard that being said about MIT. You just can't BS your way to a degree at MIT. There are no rankings, no Latin honors: just graduating is enough of an achievement. Employers and grads school admission officers know that.

The real issue is whether the OP is <b>more likely</b> to do well if he goes to MIT versus BU. The answer is unequivocally yes. That would be especially true for grad school where the difference in success rate for grad school placement between the two school is substantial. Sure, anybody can overcome all types of obstacles with a lot of effort and defy the odds. But it is very often a long shot.
[quote]it's not worth going in debt to the tune of $200 k, especially considering a free-ride at fairly good school like BU.[/quote]

The OP could never get in debt for $200K anyway. His parents could be in debt for most of the cost, but the OP could at most get in debt for around $25 K over 4 years. MIT still offers very good FA for middle class families and if his parents can afford the cost, it is probably the best investment they can make for the OP's future. Ther are VERY FEW students that turn down an admission offer because they have a better deal elsewhere. How many students admitted to Cal, UCLA or UMich, much better schools than BU, where they can pay low instate tuition, choose those schools over MIT if they have the choice. You can count them on one hand! Same thing at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford. The high yield of admitted students to HYPSM proves it. Nearly all MIT admits turn down great merit aid elsewhere. That just comes with the territory.

Pretty much every study shows that a PhD is already a very risky career choice, even in the STEM fields. Most drop out and of the few that continue to the end, an even smaller number ever make it to a livable wage. So, frankly the very worst choice the OP could do would be to save money now and risk ending up as an adjunct making $30K a year fifteen years out. Nothing ventured, nothing gained! getting into to MIT is not quite like winning the lottery but it certainly buys you a lot more tickets!

54.<<<collegealum314>>>
^Purely in terms of interest by grad schools, if you get 4.3 or higher with a good subject GRE (80%+) score you will probably get into most of the top 5 grad schools, if not all. This is just my rough recollection of physics majors that I knew. However, if you go lower than 4.3 and it becomes kind of iffy. If you really learn a lot and your GPA belies your skills, then it's possible to still be successful in admissions. 4.2 is the average GPA at MIT; I don't know what it is in physics, but I think it is fair to say there are a significang number of people under a 4.3 GPA.

Cellardweller's "nothing ventured, nothing gained" is true here. However, you should have some kind of gut feeling that you want to be at MIT. Some of the underperformers are undoubtedly people that came to MIT because of its reputation rather than for the fit. "Fit" is not just a buzzword with a school like MIT, since MIT is so different from other schools. It's not just about being hard. U. of Chicago is very rigorous especially in physics and math, but there is a very different feel to the school as well as (I think) the general pedagogical philosophy. I think words do have meaning here. The idea of "tooling", the strapping on of more and more algorithms and processing reams of problem sets, would not be used at a liberal arts school.

55.<<<lake42ks>>>
Pay close attention to at least three people's comments, collegealum314, lidusha, and PiperXP. All three were top students in high school. One went to grad school and is now a prof, one wants to go to grad school, and one is having a second thought, IIRC.

If high school was easy for you, e.g., 2380 SAT without prep, 6-8 AP per year with all 5s, and you spent most of your time having fun with something else, MIT is a great choice but you don't have to go. Otherwise, think carefully. I know one person who took a full ride to a State U and then went to MIT for grad school.

Could you please expand on this? Why would you make less with a PhD? Just trying to understand what people mean when they discuss grad school and the advantages/disadvantages of going to MIT for undergrad/grad (which I take to mean a Masters?)/PhD?

Again, could you clarify here? The average student graduating from MIT has a 4.2 (undergrad)? That seems incredibly high from my son's experience or do the GPA's go up quite a bit over the years? (I thought I'd read the reverse). Or do you mean that the average student getting into MIT for grad school has a 4.2 GPA?

Also, I know this topic has been mostly on the sciences, but those of you with experience - would you say the same holds true for engineering? Primarily in terms of grad school admissions and in terms of funding for grad school. My younger son is still trying to make a similar decision (different major/different school alternative) and has heard both that it's easier to get into MIT from another school for grad school and that it's harder. He'd love to save the money and go to his nearly full ride at a still top 10 school and then do MIT for grad school, but feels like getting into MIT this time was, as stated, a bit like "winning the lottery" and is very fearful this might never happen again!

57.<<<lidusha>>>
For some fields, MIT tries not to accept people who have already been there for undergrad. Other fields don't mind.

I know a lot of grad students at MIT who did undergrad at schools I've never heard of. To get to MIT from there, though, you really need to stand out from the crowd at your university. You need an almost perfect GPA and almost perfect (or perfect) GRE scores, you need amazing recommendations, and most importantly you need good research experience--the kind that lasts three or four years and preferably results in a publication--preferably in the field you'll be sticking with for grad school.

Going to MIT for undergrad gives you a lot more flexibility and stability. It's easier to find a research opportunity as an undergrad, your grades don't need to be perfect, and your recommendations will be coming from leaders in the field.

@marciemi--

"Why would you make less with a Ph.D?"
It all depends on what you do with it. My daughter, now in a physics Ph.D. program at Harvard, tells me that some of the graduates from that program have immediately established their own companies or gone to work for private industry. In such cases, a Ph.D. graduate has the possibility of very high earnings. Some graduates will land tenure-track positions teaching physics in colleges in universities, but such positions are pretty scarce these days. This means that some applicants will obtain only "adjunct" or "post-doc" positions which pay much less. The quoted figure of $30,000 is too low, because that's the average amount a graduate student would receive today as a living stipend from a large research university, but you might expect the earnings in such positions to range from around $40,000 to a bit higher. Quite frankly, a young physicist in such a position could triple that salary by leaving academia and joining the private sector -- it's never a dead end, in the long run.

"The average MIT student has a 4.2 undergrad gpa?"
MIT calculates GPA on a 1-5 scale, and a 4.2 translates as a 3.2 gpa. I have no idea if that's the correct figure these days, but I do think that collegealum's memories of how many MIT students went on to physics graduate school are now pretty out of date. You can visit online forums where applicants to grad schools in physics will post their test scores, experience, and gpa and then also post admission results. Just Google the phrase "Grad cafe physics forum" for example. You'll discover that admission to grad school physics programs has become really competitive.

59.<<<collegealum314>>>
When I was there, the common knowledge was that the average GPA was 4.1. I've heard that it has gone up a little. I would guess that engineering is lower than the sciences, based on the grade distribution differences in my engineering versus advanced science classes.

I don't believe I commented on how many physics students went onto grad school from MIT. I had specific knowledge of people with 4.3+ from MIT having no trouble getting into Stanford or MIT for physics grad school. I don't know what happened to the people who did worse than that in physics, though I have heard on occasion that people in other areas got into top schools with worse GPAs. However, GPA is more important for theory-heavy area. Maybe it is harder today.

I did say that getting a high GRE score will help you out a lot. One reason is that most of the top GRE SUBJECT scores in physics/chem are gotten by international students, and these guys are in a different pool. Many of the international applicants have master's degrees when they apply.

For engineering, unless I am very out-of-date, EECS and chem E require a 4.3/5.0 for automatic admission to their masters' program. PhD is a little more difficult, but if you've been working in a research group and the prof likes you, you are likely to get in. Undergrad and graduate school are very different. I don't think telling people to just go to the prestigious school for grad school is good advice. Most engineers don't even go to grad school.

Try to make an informed decision as to what is the best education and where you think you will be the happiest and/or most fulfilled. Then decide if it is worth the money. If you have a good experience at MIT, I think it is probably worth the money IMO.

[quote]That seems incredibly high from my son's experience or do the GPA's go up quite a bit over the years? (I thought I'd read the reverse).[/quote]

I assume you are asking whether GPAs tend to go up from freshman to senior year. I think the core classes in the sophomore year are often the hardest on people grade-wise, but I guess it depends on whether you go out of your way to take the harder electives later on. In some cases, some people have trouble with the GIRs but do better when they are in their specific areas of interest.

One random thought: don't pressure your kid to major in something which is not their first choice in terms of pure interest. Maybe at another school this might make sense. But they will be living and breathing their major at MIT and probably won't be able to do well if they don't like it.

For engineering, other than chemical engineering, going to MIT as an undergrad is a very significant advantage in terms of MIT grad admissions. Chem E is the only engineering department that prefers not to inbreed, but others have fairly striking preferences -- of my husband's aerospace engineering class, all but two of the graduating seniors were accepted to the department for a master's degree. About 20% of each graduating MIT class heads straight to MIT for grad school upon graduation, and more will return after working for a few years.

For my own PhD program, which is a top program in biomedical sciences, top universities are exceedingly overrepresented at the expense of state schools and lower-ranked private universities. Alums of MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, and Princeton (in that order) make up about 25% of the students entering the program over the past five entering classes. In those five years, there have been 20 MIT alums entering the program, and one BU alum.

62.<<<marciemi>>>
Thanks everyone for the insight to my add-on questions. @Mollie - I guess the fact that my son is a Chem E major helps explain why what he's telling me (almost impossible to go to grad school at MIT after undergrad) is different that what I've read on the forums in general (very likely to be able to)!

63.<<<collegealum314>>>
Did they change the policy of automatic admission to chem E master's program with a 4.3 GPA?
