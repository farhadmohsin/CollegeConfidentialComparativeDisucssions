I know that Harvard definitely beats Yale in graduate molecular and cellular biology but I was wondering if anyone knew how the biology undergraduate programs of the two universities fare.

2.<<<Remi10001>>>

3.<<<vicariousparent>>>
IMO neither is great for undergrads but I would favor Yale. Yale has a strong MB&amp;B major, or if you want to be more broadly trained in biology then MCDB.

BTW, I wouldn't be so sure about graduate studies- it all depends on your interests, the lab you end up in and ultimately on how well you do. The specific university is far less important than who your mentor was and what you did to get your PhD and whether your work made an impact.

4.<<<posterX>>>
Actually, Yale is much stronger for biology at the undergraduate level.

At the graduate level for bio, it's a wash, Yale is a bit stronger in some areas and vice versa -- the overall thing to remember is that both are among the top handful of biomedical research centers in the world, maybe even the top two in terms of overall quality. But for undergrad, Yale wins.

5.<<<datalook>>>
Yale's biology program is definitely NOT a top 2 program. I would not even call it a top 5. Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, and UCSF are all better than Yale, although not by a long shot.

According to US NEWS, all of those 5 schools are ranked ahead of Yale. Yale is a top 10, not a top 5.

6.<<<posterX>>>
I would disagree, but obviously all of those are great programs too. I would argue that Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Caltech are the top biology programs overall, with UCSF, MIT and UCSD the close runners-up.

What you might be confusing is quantity and quality. You have to distinguish between the two when talking about academic programs. Obviously, places like UCSF, Johns Hopkins, Michigan and MIT churn out more papers than Caltech each year, and are very good, but I would argue that the quality of Caltech's biology program (at both the undergraduate as well as the graduate level) and the average faculty quality is higher than that of any of those places.

One way to evaluate this is where undergrads &amp; graduate alumni end up, but that takes some legwork, including talking with a dozen or two of the school's current faculty and students and conducting meticulous research on the web. I've done a lot of that work and have partially based my conclusions on what I have seen. Another way is to evalute quality-based rankings, although they aren't necessarily conclusive. In the individual department rankings of the 2006 Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index published by the Chronicle of Higher Education, however, 4 of Yale's science departments were ranked #1 in the nation (and many others in the top five). For comparison's sake, 4 of Harvard's, 3 of Stanford's, 2 of MIT's, 1 of Princeton's, and none of Northwestern's departments were ranked #1. Another way to look at it is that 13 of Yale's biological science programs were ranked among the top 10, versus just 10 of Harvard's, 10 of UCSF's, 10 of Johns Hopkins's, 10 of Duke's, 8 of Stanford's, 6 of UCSD's, 5 of UPenn's, 4 of Berkeley's, 3 of Caltech's, and 3 of MIT's. According to a totally separate source, ScienceWatch 2006 published by ISI, if you take the average placement of the 100 largest university science programs among 21 different fields, Yale scored the highest average placement with a score of 2.67, followed MIT at 3.00, then Harvard (3.80).

In other words, you could argue that Yale is #1 for biology -- not just #2 or "top five."

More anecdotal evidence includes things such as Yale winning more young researcher (PECASE) awards this year than any other institution in the United States. Also, Yale biology faculty have won four Gairdner Awards just within the past 4 years. The Gairdner is the most prestigious science award in the world after the Nobel Prize, as about 1/4 or more of Gairdner Award winners later go on to receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine-Physiology. Yale's biomedical research program is world-renowned and rapidly expanding, and in terms of research funding per undergraduate science student, Yale beats everyone else (except for Caltech) hands-down. That means plenty of research opportunities.

Anyhow, my suggestion is to throw all of this info out the window and evaluate the program for yourself. Harvard, Yale, MIT, Johns Hopkins, UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, WUSTL, Chicago, Duke and others are all world-renowned for their biological science research, but which school has the best undergraduate program? Talk with current faculty and students and see if they like the biology program, as well as where they go after they graduate. Also it is important to see where you would best fit in as a student. Some people would do better at a place like Wellesley or Pomona -- both of which have incredible undergraduate bio programs -- than they would at a large, impersonal school like Berkeley, Stanford, Michigan, Texas, etc. It doesn't take all that much work to figure out which school is right for you, but don't base your decision on what anyone else says.

7.<<<kwijiborjt>>>
Posterx's comments are distorted nonsense as a rule, and i say this as a current undergrad. I'm a bio major (although i've only finished a semester), and i'm satisfied with the bio departments. MCDB is a very popular major, EEB (ecology and evolutionary biology) less so mostly bc almost all premeds are MCDB. A couple of the courses in the dept. are a pain, but most of them are very good, challenging, and you come out of them feeling as if you have a good understanding of the topic. Intro EEB isn't so great and the genetics course i took was kind of disappointing, but i've heard a lot of really good things about the intermediate/upper level courses in both departments. It's pretty safe to say that the bio dept. is far more popular than the chem and physics depts, and is probably yale's strongest overall. It's also very easy to get lab experience if that's what you're looking for.

While i can't say much about Harvard, my god, have you been in their science center? It's probably the most hideous building in the world. That shouldn't discourage you from investigating their biology departments (i think they split it into five or six specialized sections), but that building is the most wretched waste of coveted real estate i've ever seen...

8.<<<Tami>>>
I have heard great things about Yale's biology program as well, especially their MB&amp;B major. I'm sure at the undergraduate level, it's really hard to distinguish the bads from the goods.

Datalook's posts really bother me--looking back at some of his posts, he (or she) is strongly <b>anti-Yale, and very pro-Stanford</b>. Posters like these distort people's views of what each institution has to offer. It's really childish IMO.

9.<<<Remi10001>>>
Poor Stanford (or poor me), I decided not to apply there mainly because of that disgusting supplement...

In reality, Stanford is indeed better than Yale in lots of things. Stanford beats Yale in every single department in science and technology according to US-News: math, physics, chemsitry, biology, geology, computer science, and any field in engineering. This is just a fact.

11.<<<datalook>>>
<a href="http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/phdsci/phdsciindex_brief.php" rel="nofollow">usnews.com: America's Best Graduate Schools 2008: Complete Guide to Programs in the Sciences</a>

The ranking only lists the top 3 institutions in overall ranking and every subfield ranking.

Harvard and Stanford ranked as top 3 for 8 times.
MIT ranked as top 3 for 4 times.
Berkeley and UCSF ranked as top 3 for 2 times.
JHU and Wisconsin-Madison also ranked as top 3 at least 1 time.

Unfortunately, you can not find Yale.

Again, I'm not saying Yale is not great in biology. I'm just pointing out that Yale is not a top 5 program in biology.

12.<<<rd31>>>
Well since US news apparantly provides the final, and only word, let's not forget that Yale CONSISTENTLY ranks ahead of Stanford as an OVERALL undergraduate institution!

13.<<<SourApplezz>>>
SOMEBODY got rejected from Yale...;)

Notice: OP mentioned UNDERGRADUATE. Your ranking is clearly fo GRADUATE schools.

You can't call USNews as something factual. By that logic, you'd have to admit that in overall undergraduate rankings, Yale is better than Stanford simply because it is ranked #3 and Stanford #4.

Of course, I'm sure you'll run off to google to find some other ranking that states otherwise. But that would debunk your original logic as USNews being the final word. I love how you call all rankings that place Stanford below "stupid," and only cite those that place Stanford ahead as "factual."

I'm guessing you are either:

1. A high school students who really has no idea what these colleges are like and think he/she has all the answers thanks to amazingly accurate sources as college rankings-

2. A Yale REJECT and a Stanford ADMIT

3. A Yale REJECT and a Stanford REJECT who received a kinder rejection letter from Stanford.

I'm going with #2.

14.<<<rd31>>>
Stanford would be foolish to admit someone as immature and misguided as Datalook, as would any selective university. I wonder if he realizes that his incessant and overly assertive attitude towards Stanford actually weakens the perception of it.

Datalook, Stanford doesn't need nor does it deserve someone like you to fend for it. Go get a life.

15.<<<truazn8948532>>>
Haha... don't harp on datalook or any other **** for that matter

Every Ivy on here has its share of ****:

For Yale, it's PosterX.

But anyway, back to the point. You can't really rank undergraduate biology programs because by and large they're pretty much the same everywhere. But reputation-wise, Harvard has Yale beat (just like Harvard beats everyone in just about everything ::cough 36,000,000,000 cough::

16.<<<datalook>>>
rd31,

By reading a meassage from you, I feel some Yale people are just so so. In the past, I have met several Yale co-workers. To be honest, they are just average people. I can easily find several people from average universities that are more capable than them.

If you are proud of being at Yale, the "US-News #3 school". , enjoy your time there. I didn't go to Stanford. And I have never applied for Yale because Yale is not so great in the areas I'm interested in.

For any major in science and engineering, Stanford is better than Yale. That is just a fact.

Try to retort my arguments without any personal attack.

17.<<<Tami>>>
datalook,

<b>If you are indeed an adult, I question whether you have been acting like one</b>, tearing down other universities and being so eager to point out to high school students the flaws of these institutions.

<b>It is not just a fact. Not. How do you justify your "fact?" By college rankings? What exactly makes those rankings "factual?" Just because some university invented some company, or has some amount of money, or has some professor, doesn't make it "factually" better than another school.</b> In fact, how exactly is Stanford better? It depends on the student's preference--and if you chose where you applied for your bachelor's based on the <u>graduate ranking</u> (which seems to be the resource you countelessly have turned to) of that school, I believe that to be a true flaw, and something that should NOT BE ADVOCATED for High school students. Rankings are an opinion, of which factors of a college is important. Just an opinion.

I'm glad to see that you believe Stanford is an awesome university, because it IS. But so is Yale. "X is better than Y" can never be a fact when it comes to these levels of colleges.

I'm sure people are happy to be at Yale and "enjoying their time there" without you having to tell them to do so, thank you.

If you are truly an adult as you say you are, you have a lot of learning to do from some of the other adult posters on the board, who give sage advice on personal fit, and advocate students to disregard rankings. If USNews is so factual, Stanford, the "US-News #4 school" is a ranking hardly mentioned by yourself ;). Also, don't be so naive and judge an entire university as a whole based on one poster, please. That's just beyond childish.

18.<<<amb3r>>>
[quote]By reading a meassage from you, I feel some Yale people are just so so.[/quote]

I definitely feel that there are schools (I'm thinking MIT in particular, and I think that there are quite a few more in engineering, math, and computer science) better than Yale for science, but the above statement is absolutely ridiculous. Yale graduates are only "so-so"?? What planet do you come from?
[quote]I can easily find several people from average universities that are more capable than them.[/quote]

This statement is absolutely meaningless. Will Hunting was a janitor and probably smarter than the average Harvard graduate. Does that mean janitors are smarter than Harvard graduates or that Harvard is only "so-so"? Clearly not! What's important is not that you can find "several" or even a busload of people from state universities who are smarter than Yale students. What matters is the OVERALL level of intelligence and academic curiosity in each school! It is hardly believable to me that you are an adult, because you surely do not reason like an adult.

19.<<<datalook>>>
amb3r,

I said <b>some</b> Yale people are so-so. I didn't say <b>All</b> Yale people are so-so.

I said the co-workers around me from Yale are avaerage. I didn't say all Yale graduates are average.

I hope you are smart enough to understand that.

20.<<<rd31>>>
Then your whole statement about "some" people from Yale being so-so is really meaningless isn't it?
There are "some" Harvard people that are so-so aren't there?
There are "some" Stanford people that are so-so aren't there?

THANK YOU CAPTAIN OBVIOUS.

What was your reason for even making that statement if you weren't trying to imply something about the institution? Don't try to cover your tracks, I can see right through that.

Your reasoning and retorts are all pretty laughable, not to mention pathetic.

21.<<<datalook>>>
rd31,

To know the quality of education at Stanford or Yale, you don't have to go there to get a degree. You can look at their peer assessment score, their faculty's achievement, their graduates achievement, their contributions to the human being.

For the same reason, lots of people talked about politics. Not all of them are politicians. You can not say they are not qualified to talk about politics
because they are not a politician or they have never been a politician.

I think I have been talking about facts and truths. If it seems an insult to some of you Yale people, that simply means some of you Yale people can not take the truth.

22.<<<Remi10001>>>
The OP is shaking his head... and he's not happy about it. please stop the flaming. I started this thread for the sole purpose of receiving some hard facts and numbers leading to an unbiased conclusion about the schools (not just nearly pre-determined/relatively meaningless rankings) or some nice tasty anecdotal evidence. I thank those who have offered their first-hand accounts. Datalook, I think you need to read a bit more about the nature of "facts and truths." Wikipedia is a good start ;). I would surmise that some "Yale people" cannot take "the truth," but the truth needs to be made evident before we can confirm that hypothesis of yours.

So in closing, I'm open for some more Yalie/Harvard student accounts

23.<<<Tami>>>
Apologies to the OP.

Datalook, your metaphor is flawed. Politics is readily accessible to the general public; it is up to the people to see all its aspects and judge it. Also, it is true that not everyone is politicians, but there is a reason politicians are the ones who people turn to in learning about politics. Likewise, students of those colleges--people who are actually there and seeing it, are the ones we turn to for true resource.

Not someone sitting at home paying $14.95 for full subcription to USNews.com.

These colleges, however, cannot be correctly assessed unless one actually attended and experienced it for themselves. Peer assessment, faculty achievement and graduate achievement cannot and should not be numerically scaled.<b> They are simply opinions. Opinions. Please get that through your head.</b>

Contributions to the human being? How do you even quantify that? What is considered a true contribution to mankind?

You have not been taling about facts and truths. Rather, you ignore every data that disagrees with your petty USNews rankings, and continue to DISREGARD the fact that what you are doing helps no one. I don't know what student wouldn't be offended when people continue to state that their school is not even close to top five in so-and-so, not as good as so-and-so, etc.

<b> You say things, claiming they are true, while you know that it offends people. You hurt others purposefully, unless you are too blind to even see that. </b>

Also, Please read my above post and STOP IGNORING IT:
[quote]f you are indeed an adult, I question whether you have been acting like one, tearing down other universities and being so eager to point out to high school students the flaws of these institutions.

It is not just a fact. Not. How do you justify your "fact?" By college rankings? What exactly makes those rankings "factual?"

The Yale UNDERgraduate (contrary to what Datalook has been arguing) biology program is amazing. I learned more in my one semester of MCDB 120 than I have in all of AP Biology and high school freshman biology. I also had the opportunity to join a research lab in the graduate department. I'm a freshman and I get to do graduate level research on the origin of neural crest cells!

Datalook, the US News methodology for graduate rankings does not confirm anything about the undergraduate program. Believe me, I know the value of the Yale biology program more than you do. All you have are your narrow views and US News rankings that have been criticized since their birth.

Also notice that I stick to WHAT I KNOW. I'm not making comments on Harvard's biology program because I HAVE NOT ATTENDED. Maybe you should stick to what you know. Which is basically nothing other than your oh-so-valuable US News graduate departmental rankings.

25.<<<amb3r>>>
[quote]amb3r,

Every single university on the face of the Earth has average graduates.

I hope you are smart enough to understand that.

26.<<<datalook>>>
tami,

For a given university, the quality of its undergraduate program can be inferred from its graduate program, especially for a reasearch university. I'll use engineering as an example.

For US NEWS undergraduate ranking in engineering, see
<url>http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/gra...rank_brief.php</url>

To summarize, we have
school/graduate_ranking/undergraduate_ranking
MIT/1/1
Stanford/2/2
Berkeley/3/2
Georgia Tech/4/6
UIUC/5/4
CMU/6/8
Caltech/7/4
USC/8/?
Michigan/9/6
Cornell/10/10
.........
Yale/37/43

So there is no big difference between graduate ranking and undergraduate ranking. The ranking of LACs might be a different story. If a LAC doesn't have a graduate program, of course you can not use its graduate school ranking to infer its undergraduate ranking.

Hence, it is fair to infer the quality of Yale's biology program for undergraduate based on its graduate program. That is the reason I say Yale's biology program is not top 5. Yes, for undergraduate.

27.<<<Tami>>>
Alright, let's stop arguing. I don't see a point in going back and forth with someone who doesn't listen or have the courtesy to read what others post. I find that extremely rude.

Go polish your USNews book.

28.<<<rd31>>>
although there is a significant difference between 37 and 1 (Yale vs. MIT for engineering) there is NO significant difference if Yale has a graduate ranking of 7 or so in biology and Harvard has a graduate ranking of 2. The differences in biology are miniscule. Coupling this with the subjective nature of the rankings DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO MAKE THE CONCLUSIONS YOU'RE MAKING.

AND just because the trend exists for engineering does not allow you to extrapolate to other departments. Your judgment is ridiculous.

Are you a statistician datalook? I sure hope not.

29.<<<amb3r>>>
Yale is significantly weaker than Harvard on engineering, but not, I believe, in biology, which is its strongest science department. We need to look at the relevant set of stats.

30.<<<datalook>>>
More truths about the quality of biology programs by looking at the prestigious NIH Director's pioneer award winners for different universities:

<a href="http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/pioneer/AwardRecipients.aspx" rel="nofollow">NIH Director's Pioneer Award - Award Recipients</a>

It has 4 years of data. 40+ biologists have won this award. Unfortunately, none of them is from Yale so far. Harvard, Stanford, MIT, UCSF, Berkeley, JHU, Caltech all have multiple winners.

31.<<<rd31>>>
Datalook, those awards are for medical research, and reflect the medical school (and Yale IS on the evaluation committee for the award). Once again, you neglect to consider undergraduate biology. You also neglect to consider all of the awards Yale biology faculty have won. Take a look:

<a href="http://www.medicineatyale.org/v2i5_sept_oct_2006/awards.html" rel="nofollow"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5d103839343e3433381d043c3138">[emailprotected]</span> - Awards &amp; honors</a>
<a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/17255?badlink=1" rel="nofollow">Yale Daily News - Biology professors receive prestigious award for genetics research</a>
<a href="http://yalemedicine.yale.edu/ym_su00/faculty/faculty1.html" rel="nofollow">Yale Medicine-Faculty News</a>

among COUNTLESS others.

Just because Yale isn't represented in an obscure MEDICAL award (which is NOT representative of an entire undergraduate biology program), it hardly says anything about the undergraduate biology program. FYI, Biology is a broad discipline. Human medicine is a small branch.

Your desperate attempts to prove your empty assertions will never fail to amuse me.

32.<<<Tami>>>
Nice use of words to beef up your comment, datalook. I only see 1 from Caltech, not "multiple winners." I can't seem to find the one from JHU. Half of your Stanford winners teach at the med school, same goes for Harvard. And...is that 1 for UCSF as well?

Also, winning an award does not always a great professor, make.

33.<<<datalook>>>
Look at it carefully, multiple winners are from UCSF, Caltech, and JHU (prof. or Ph.d). Again, Yale has no connection to NIH pioneer award.

34.<<<rd31>>>
Don't you ignore my comments datalook. and yes, Yale DOES have a connection to the NIH pioneer award since a Yale faculty member sits on the evaluation committee!

why are you throwing around this word "again"? do you think it adds to your argument? it's as if you've been making valid points all along! Not. True. you've provided one incredibly narrow example that implies nothing about the OVERALL undergraduate biology program!

Why don't you acknowledge my last post? Are you speechless?

35.<<<Tami>>>
Because you often need people to post twice before you read what they actually write:

"Winning an award does not always a great professor, make."

Datalook, I have a question: what happens if a student attending Stanford never has that award-winning professor, but instead gets a different professor?

36.<<<datalook>>>
[quote]although there is a significant difference between 37 and 1 (Yale vs. MIT for engineering) there is NO significant difference if Yale has a graduate ranking of 7 or so in biology and Harvard has a graduate ranking of 2.

According to US News biology ranking for graduate, the #2 Harvard has a peer assessment score 4.8, while the #7 Yale has a score of 4.5. A gap of 0.3 is not very big, but still significant. When it comes to undergraduate, I just don't believe Yale will magically get even with Harvard by overcoming a gap of 0.3.

37.<<<datalook>>>
[quote]Datalook, I have a question: what happens if a student attending Stanford never has that award-winning professor, but instead gets a different professor?[/quote]

I think going to Stanford will give you a better chance of being taught by an award winning professor. If you want to take a lesson from a professor who has won NIH pioneer award, you can find 9 of those at Stanford, while you can not find any at Yale.

38.<<<rd31>>>
Datalook, why don't you understand that the NIH pioneer award is from the National Institutes of HEALTH. This means MEDICINE. This is not representative of UNDERGRADUATE BIOLOGY. Get over yourself.

You continue to ignore many of my points. You only reply to the ones you can answer. (There you go again with your oh-so-reliable US News PA.) The Peer Assessment is again for GRADUATE Departments. You cannot extrapolate for the undergraduate department in biology like you can for engineering. Stop pretending to be some kind of statistician.

The OP has already mentioned that she wants to hear from Harvard and Yale students about the departments. This is what actually matters, not your meaningless rankings and your one obscure example of an award in medicine. According to my last post, which you continue to ignore, Yale faculty have won numerous awards and recognition in the broad discipline of biology (NOT JUST MEDICINE). You fail to acknowledge this because you are so incredibly narrow minded.

Any idiot can go scout out information on the internet that somehow makes Yale look significantly weaker in the graduate biology department. If the OP wanted this information, he/she could have done this him/herself. You are not qualified to use information in graduate areas to comment on the undergraduate biology department. The OP wants STUDENTS who have first-hand experience to comment. This does not include you, Datalook. So please quietly leave this forum as your misguided comments are of no use to anyone.

39.<<<unalove>>>
When we do Yale vs. Harvard or great school vs. great school threads, my initial reaction is, "get in first, then we'll talk."

If this issue is really bugging you, I suggest you spend some time with the biology department websites of each school. What courses are offered? What are professor specialties? Where did <i>those</i> professors do undergrad and graduate work? What do you think qualifies a "good" biology program? (Lab opportunities, good professors, field opportunities, med school placement?)

Do what you can to find data on professors and quality of teaching. Some schools might have online course evaluations that are open to the public (Chicago has online course evaluations that were open when I was a high school student, but they have since been blocked off). Look for other things-- professors who win undergraduate teaching awards. Type names into google or wikipedia and see what comes up. (I do this when I research professors for classes I might want to take).

I don't think there is any simple answer to your question.

40.<<<Remi10001>>>
Unalove, I did get in to Yale EA and I have a lingering suspicion that I'll get into Harvard due to the fact that my two apps were virtually identical.
