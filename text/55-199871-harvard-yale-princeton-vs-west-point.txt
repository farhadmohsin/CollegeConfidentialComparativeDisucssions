1.<<<Curious Kid>>>
I've heard that it is harder to get into West Point than to top Ivies. Is this true? Approximately how many people apply to West Point each year? I also heard that West Point is the best among the Military schools as well, is this true? Thanks!

2.<<<cadetfor5>>>
Academically it isnt as tough and maybe not even e.c.'s but you have to be in shape to get into an academy which the other schools dont require

3.<<<rtbcadet15>>>
Well, the fact that you have to be academically- AND physically-/medically-qualified makes it a lot harder to get into service academies.

I think on average, around 13000 people apply... around 12-14% get in. Those are just my estimates.

4.<<<WAMom68>>>
I am not sure if West Point is harder to get into because I don't know the stats for the ivy league schools, but if you check out this link: <url>http://www.usma.edu/Class/2009/profile.asp</url> you will see the entering profile for class of 2009. If you take the total number of accepted candidates (1251) and divide by the number of applicant files started (10,773) you get about 11.6% accepted out of the original applicants. On the USMA website you can see the entering profiles for the last few classes and that will give you an idea of how many people apply each year.

This link: <url>http://www.dean.usma.edu/Scholarships/</url> also shows how many Rhodes, Hertz, Marshall, etc. scholars there are from USMA compared to other ivy league schools. I also found USMA on the best colleges lists of US News and World Report and the Princeton Review.

I know I am biased, but I do think West Point is THE best military school. :D

5.<<<marmadillo>>>
Well, the Naval Academy had 4 Rhodes Scholars this year -- more than ANY other school has ever had in one year :) In the spirit of service academy brotherhood, I know West Point's physical requirements are more stringent than the Naval Academy's.

6.<<<tabuLaRasa>>>
Hm... yeah I don't think the academic requirements are more selective than the Ivies. At all. It's the physical requirements. I'm going to the SLS thing not because I'm going to West Point, but holy c rap, just looking at the CFA or whatever requirements blows my mind. I mean, peopel are talking about 5:20 ish miles or something. That takes an insane level of dedication/fitness for regular bummish people (like me).

7.<<<landsy>>>
Those times are maximums, last year I ran a 7 min mile and was at no risk for application rejection because of physical fitness.

8.<<<shogun>>>
It's not just about "getting in" but being able to stay in. My nephew went to Harvard and his comment was that once you got in the battle to stay in was pretty much won as long as you kept up with tuition. It took a lot for them to throw you out. At the service academies you have to prove your "metal" every day--physically and mentally. Many at the Ivies would never get accepted or be able to stay at an academy like West Point no matter how academically gifted they are. Being a "whole person" candidate/student is a lot tougher.

9.<<<tabuLaRasa>>>
Ooh this is interesting. Shogun, can you expand on your perspective? I'm aiming for the Ivies and I'm 99% sure I'm not interested in West Point, but I've always wondered (besides physical fitness) how West Point kids are different. I mean, I know plenty of Harvard/MIT/whatever kids who have nerves of steel and can withstand intense psychological and mental pressure. I suppose pushing yourself to the limit in that sense is different from the mental preparation required to suceed in the military, but I never really understood in what way. Is it the combination of academics and physical activities? Or is it just the serving in the military thing that's lots of pressure?

10.<<<USMMA2009>>>
who cares how tough it is to get in. i can guarantee you that all ther service academies are tougher than than any other college or university

11.<<<M of BTT's '10>>>
I think it's a vocation; along the lines of a religious vocation. You just know that this is where you're supposed to be. All the other schools are definitely second choice if you reallly want to go to a service academy. It takes a lot of dedication in many areas to get in. Plus you know that you are committed for many years, including summers.

12.<<<Mumford2009>>>
Tabu: What do you mean they have nerves of steel? I'm not disagreeing I just think its a weird comment to make about people who (I'm genaralizing) don't go through an enormous amount of stress everyday.

13.<<<aloutak>>>
Yeah, academically not even close. The Ivies are much more selective and probably "harder to get into." I think that West Point has a lower acceptance rate than some of the Ivies, but still probably isn't as hard to get into. You have to look at the caliber of students who are applying. West Point might get more applicants, but not necessarily more qualified ones. I think nearly all Harvard students are more than academically qualified for any service academy.

14.<<<tabuLaRasa>>>
Er...I guess I'm just referring to the small percentage of students who push themselves an insane amount. For instance, some Caltech students that I know are the most driven individuals I've ever met. They can work hardcore for like 6 hours straight, never stopping their critical thinking. Most people get tired after taking the SAT.

15.<<<taffy>>>
I think that the service academies fiddle with their numbers quite a bit. "Applicant Files Started" does not show how many applicants there are. Harvard doesnt report its admit % using the amount of people that considered possibly applying to the place, but the number of people who completed the application and were actually CONSIDERED. 13,000 applicant files started translates into very few files completed which raises the admit % quite a bit.

Also, you CANNOT compare admit percentages. I don't know how many times I have to explain this to everybody but the admit % just reflects the applicant pool in comparison to the college's standards.

I believe that one of the most important factors of getting into a service academy is not how many volunteer hours you have or whatever, but the district you are in and your luck with who your competition is. Last year only 1 person from my district applied to USNA, so if that applicant was the average applicant, then USNA wasn't that hard to get into last year. USMA had about 7 applicants this year and we were all very competitive... I was ranked like 5th and was considered "academically and physically qualified" by usma. Something like 65% of applicants in this category get appointments, but not in my district last year. It may be a totally different beast this year for my district, and I'm hoping my luck says it is.

Sparknotes: luck, luck luck, cant compare admit %, nobody wants to go to usna, applicant files started doesnt equal applicants.

16.<<<shogun>>>
I hate to generalize, and I mean no offense to anyone BUT if I had to chose whether the average Ivy Leaguer could survive 4 years at West point or the average West Pointer could survive 4 years at Harvard (assuming it still only takes 4 years to graduate a civilian college--I'm old :) ) I think I'd have my money on the cadet.

17.<<<marines4me>>>
Yea--anyone that hasn't been here wouldn't understand what it's like. Academically, it's harder to get into the Ivies. However, West Point doesn't just base it on the Academics. They use the so called "whole person" scale to judge the applicants. A candidate cannot be accepted unless being well rounded not only academically, but also physically and with respect to extracurriculars.

My opinion on whether the Academy is actually harder than the Ivies? Most definitely. Academically? Most certainly not. It turns out that a lot of schools actually won't accept a lot of credits from West Point when a student transfers, mostly in the sciences (but this is just for the lower level courses). For example, West Point prefers to cover a larger spectrum of Chemistry, so thus doesn't go as in-depth. West Point academics aren't that hard(well, except for math), there's just a lot of WORK, plus you're exposed to a lot of things that are not necessarily your strengths. West Point has a very LARGE amount of required courses, including 2 semesters of a foreign language, 2 years of English, 2 semesters of History, 2 semesters of psychology, 2 years of various math courses, philosophy, american politics, sociology, a required engineering track, 2 semesters of Information Technology (don't be fooled--this translates to programming), 2 semesters of combatives, one round of gymnastics, one round of survival swimming, 4 years of military courses, among others. There's a lot that I'm forgetting.

The average West Point student gets FIVE HOURS of sleep a night--and for me, that's a good night. On top of that we have required duties, mandatory events, mandatory sports, drill, and various other functions. Two hours a day are MANDATORY to participate in sports or in drill, depending on the day. Meals are required except for dinner. My barracks room is not just the room I sleep in. It's my office, and working hours go from 0520 to 2330 (11:00 PM). Anyone can come in at any time. The doors stay unlocked the entire day for inspection. The doors remain completely open from 0730 to 0930. Anyone can come in and touch your stuff, which has to be arranged according to regulations. We oftentimes have training on the weekends, and its extremely hard to get away.

It's impossible to explain to you how stressful West Point is--you'd just have to see it yourself. It challenges you in every single aspect, which I would be prone to say that the Ivies don't. I can't recall that any Ivy League school REQUIRES its students to jump into a wave pool with wind and strobe lights overhead, rain pouring down, wearing 45 pounds worth of weight, a pair of boots, and holding a rifle (yes, that's right, swimming with a rifle). Not fun, extremely frightening. But you know what? I did it. I hated every minute of it, but I did it. And I honestly believe I'm a stronger person for it. The Ivies challenge you academically--West Point challenges me in every way. After all, most Ivy Leaguers aren't preparing to go out and risk their lives to defend others. The thought of catching a bullet on Wall Street would never cross their minds, even as I might be in a firefight on the streets of Baqubah.

Yet, the most stressful part of all comes from something else. How many Ivy Leaguers have to sit at a mandated meal and listen as someone announces the death of one of their friends, one of their classmates, one of their loved ones, over a microphone in the center of the mess hall? You will never, ever know what that feels like--be glad of it. You won't know what the word "duty" entails until you sit there and hear that. You won't know what loyalty is until you see a man with both his legs blown off, walking on prosthetics, having come back to the Academy to take a physical test to see whether he can go back and fight with his unit in Iraq. You just can't know.

I'm sorry if I'm seeming rather somber... My boyfriend's unit has been in Iraq since January, but he's joining them in August because of various schools he's been going to. They were scheduled to be back in December, but their deployment has been extended--and they redeploy in less than a year, in October. He won't be back until halfway into my Firstie year. So excuse me for my sadness... I'm feeling pretty down.

18.<<<shogun>>>
M4Me, I think you expressed yourself well. Hang in there and enjoy CFT next week!! :)

19.<<<marines4me>>>
lol... "Enjoy". I'll certainly be enjoying the one extra day of patrolling... :)

20.<<<shogun>>>
Well, at least enjoy your last few days before you go back:)
Daughter is spending her time off running marathons. Last week it was the San Diego Marathon and tomorrow it is an Ultra-Marathon (30 miler) at Big Bear Mountain (abt 8000ft)---ugh!!! Im embarassed to even tell her what I used to do on my time off from college :(

21.<<<marines4me>>>
Geeeeez... Tell her good luck! That's ridiculous!

22.<<<momoftwins>>>
Hey, shogun. Maybe you could just share your college recreation stories with us - your small group of cc friends. No one else will ever find out. :D

23.<<<shogun>>>
Oh man...........I spent a lot of my time with my eyes closed..........

24.<<<Homer09>>>
i just thought i's throw something out there. if you look at the princeton review, which is highly respected, they review all colleges and compare them. they list usma as number 13 on a list called "their students never stop studying." they also rate each college academically giving it a number (1-100 i guess). usma was given a 97 rating, usna a 92, and usafa a 98. in comparison, harvard was given a 92, cornell an 89, princeton an 88, yale a 97, and stanford a 96. i thought that was kind of interesting.

25.<<<ragmanlaw>>>
Why are you trying to compare. The main reason you should be going to West Point is if you have a desire to be a commisioned officer in the United States Army. Not because of prestige, percentages, or anything else. Rankings are fubar guys. I applied to Princeton and Yale, and didn't get in. Of course, they were my 4th and 5th respectively, so I didn't mind much. But who wants to be immersed into the liberal hoopa of civilian college life anyhow??

26.<<<shogun>>>
If you are concerned about the "liberal hoopa" of civilian colleges there are plenty that might satisfy you...Bob Jones University comes to mind.
The thing I am impressed with at West Point so far is that there doesn't seem to be a "liberal" or "conservative" bent to it.

Service to the nation is apolitical. As it should be. The notion that patriotism and "love of country" is a "conservative" OR "liberal" value is absurd and un-American.

27.<<<Bossf51>>>
Excellent post Shogun. There are tons of conservative kids at the Ivy schools and plenty of moderate/liberal kids at the academies. I know bc mine is one of the latter.

28.<<<momoftwins>>>
Amen, shogun!

29.<<<WPSON2010>>>
Labels like "liberal" and "conservative" are more frequently than not misleading, and seem more designed to end discussion than to encourage it. Most of the people I know are politically all over the road, and that's how it should be. And Shogun, I couldn't agree more that no group has the inside track on patriotism though there are those who would like you to believe that if you don't aspose to their form of politics you're somehow deficient in this regard. Some of this discourse reminds me of when we were involved in Viet Nam and the "love it (meaning support the war) or leave it" rhetoric. Some things never change.

Anyway, to add to this discussion, my son, who wants to study engineering chose West Point over his prior first choice of the U.C. Berkeley Engineering Department. For those who aren't familiar with U.C. Berkeley Engineering, it's one of the most highly regarded programs in the world and extreemly difficult to get into. But in my son's mind there really is no way to compare West Point to any non-service academy university because they are simply too different. For my son, who wants to serve his nation in the profession of arms as as the best Army officer he can be, the choice was simple and he's never looked back. You choose Yale/Harvard/Princton/Cal/Mit/etc. for one reason; you choose West Point for other reasons.

30.<<<ragmanlaw>>>
When I mean liberal, I mean overtly liberal. Greenpeace, protesting constantly over meaningless things. Constant bashing of government, communist/socialist-like individuals, hippees, individuals who don't seem to think there is anything remotely wrong with smoking marijuana, changing partners every week and have absolutely no values or sense of ethics. I don't believe liberal is the right term for these individuals. They, in my book are called "wrong," "unethical," "unpatriotic," and "immoral." They are the ones that apply the term "liberal," not me. Thats what they choose to be called.

31.<<<momoftwins>>>
WPSON2010,

Welcome aboard and thank you for your insightful post. You raised a wonderful son and I hope you keep us posted on this first year.

32.<<<shogun>>>
A really moral and just person once said,

"Oh wouldn't it be nice if everyone had the same sense of morality, justice, equality, values, ethics, and religious beliefs as I."

Fortunately in a free society that never happens.

33.<<<WPSON2010>>>
momoftwins, thanks for the welcome! I hope I can contribute something constructive to this group. Certainly this past year has been an amazing journey of discovery for our entire family and for our close friends who have given nothing but support to our son. West Point is a unique institution and national treasure we should all be very proud of.

ragmanlaw; being a work in progress I'm in no position to be throwing stones about morals or ethics and I try to listen to the legitimate concerns of people from groups like Greenpeace, the ACLU, and pot-smoking hippies. And bashing the government and protesting are time honored American traditions I hope will never disappear. What I enjoy listening to are carefully thought out positions based on information from both wide and broad sources of information. Not infrequently these positions are the opposite to my own, but that's when I also seem to enjoy them the most.

Conversely, it becomes obvious pretty quickly when someone hasn't done their homework and is simply regurgutating the company line. I give my boys hell when I hear them parrot my own positions and god save them if they ever quote me verbatim because then I know they've taken the easy way out and really don't know what they're talking about.

Interestingly, West Point is known for inviting well informed speakers from the "opposition" to talk to the cadets. Those speakers are often shocked at the invitation, and then even more shocked when they ask if there are any topics that are off limits and are told there are none. From what I have read from the memos from these speakers the experience is intellectually transforming and they leave West Point with a new found appreciation for this country, our history, and our military. And because these folks are real sharp the cadets learn that there can be more than one well reasoned side to an argument, that anti-war is not necessarily anti-american, and that liberal is not dirty word.

34.<<<Jamzmom>>>
Sweet! Another fabulous Mom to add to the list of great folks in here. I enjoyed reading your posts. :)

35.<<<shogun>>>
Welcome WPSON2010! Last week at our WP parents club we were able to meet 5 newly accepted candidates eagerly awaiting R Day. A smart bunch of young men and women. Iam sure your son will fit right in!

36.<<<WPSON2010>>>
Thanks shogun! We had my sons graduation party yesterday and he runs with a pretty smart group of kids, but the cadets I've had the pleasure to meet at WP are a different breed apart and a group he's really looking forward to joining. After the party my son's WP laison gave him one of his Ranger tags for my son to keep in his wallet for inspiration when the going gets tough. My son was speachless and tried to give the tag back knowing it had to be earned even to be touched, but his liaison, who is a tremendous person, insisted he could keep it. To my son, who aspires to be a Ranger, the tag ment more than all of money and other gifts he recieved combined.

Jamzmom: If you were refering to me thanks!...except for the part about being a mom. My wife of twenty years would be very surprised to hear the news I've been so careful to keep from her all this time.

37.<<<Jamzmom>>>
LOL! Sorry about that WPSON2010. With such thoughtful posts I assumed.... Not that Dad's aren't thoughtful mind you... LOL I'll just shush &amp; taste my shoe leather now. My son is at USMMA but I like to come in here and bug Momoftwins &amp; Shogun from time to time. Thats a really great story about the tag. He will treasure it forever I think. You have to be so proud and so many others here share that with you. Great luck to your son &amp; your family. Enjoy every minute! This first year flew by and you won't believe how fast. They told us that last year &amp; I didn't buy it. They weren't kidding.

Again, sorry (Dad) :)

38.<<<KASHIV>>>
You're joking right, define academically! West Point's average GPA is about 3.8 and average SAT Score is about 625M and 642CR. Most of them are in their top 10% of their class, NHS members, and NSMQT qualified. So in your mind 4.0 is the only exception of high academic quality. I also forgot to tell you that West Point requires leadership skills. Ivy League schools wants you with high grades, numerous club activites and communty service hours, and they just want your tuition. My friends and my teacher go to an Ivy League school, so I know. Being Captain of the football team is different than to be just on the football team. West Point looks more of this. Oh yeah, West Point is also competitve physically. To be appointed at West Point you have to pass all parts of the CFA and you have to be physically competive once you get there.

39.<<<CLBecker>>>
Shogun,

Bingo!

40.<<<Wje9164be>>>
Not sure if I'm fully qualified to answer your question but I'm a West Point grad who has written a book on selective college admissions. In terms of admissions rates, the Ivy League schools vary from 5 percent admit rate to something like 12 percent at Cornell. West point's admit rate is 9 percent. The academic credentials of most incoming cadets are not as strong as those of Ivy League students but there is much greater emphasis on leadership. An Academy education is like drinking from a firehouse. There is never enough time to do everything so you become talented at multi-tasking. Two of my classmates were Rhodes scholars.

41.<<<aglages>>>
9% of what number? How many applicants actually filled out their <u>entire</u> applications vs how many received Appointments? From which year are your getting you data?

42.<<<aglages>>>
Thanks @Wje9164be . Kind of what I figured and a good lesson to those that seek advice or insight on this site to be very skeptical of the sources. Anyone can post numbers and then claim they are facts. Take all of it with a grain of salt.

43.<<<Wje9164be>>>
Www.usma.edu/admissions provides a class profile showing 13,827 applicants "started files" and 1,257 were admitted. That is 9.09 percent. Arguably starting a file is not the same as sending in a college application but the accepted way publications like Forbes or US News and World Report look at the military academy stats is to report files started as applications. I double checked and Cornell's admit rate in 2014 was 14 percent not 12 percent. Harvard's admit rate this year was slightly over 5 percent as published in the Harvard Crimson and other sources. Wbat part of my post are you questioning?

44.<<<aglages>>>
The accuracy of 9%. Regardless of how anyone else evaluated "started files" a more accurate (and honest) method would be completed applications. Now how about (for the USMA) you define what actually constitutes a "started file". What information is required to qualify as a "started file"? What if a HS student is not interested in applying for the USMA but instead is only interested in the USMA's Summer Session.....would that also count as a "started file"?
BTW - Thanks for your service.

45.<<<Wje9164be>>>
Yes it probably would. To apply for the Summer Leadership program applicants are required to start a file. In defense of how thus figure is reported, I'm not sure at what point you would say a file is complete. After initial file is created teacher recommendations are completed, the CFA test is completed, a congressional interview happens, and a medical review takes place. Saying that all this has to happen before someone has applied is setting the bar pretty high. While it makes USMA and the other service academies appear more selective than perhaps they really are, it's possible that there simply isn't a clear point in time after the initial file that would equal when a college application has been filed. I have heard criticism of USNA for taking thus too far and reporting candidate postcards as applications

46.<<<aglages>>>
I have heard the same about the USNA. I think that it is important for applicants to realize that the more of your application you complete.....the greater the chances of admission. Not sure that is true with the Ivies. I believe I've read somewhere that if you are a fully qualified applicant to the USMA (application completed).....your chances for admission (Appointment) are about 50%.

47.<<<jc40>>>
Aglages, you cannot imply that if an applicant completely fills out the application, then his/her chances for admission are 50% -- that's misleading. You must factor in the congressional appointment which is a requirement as well. I've heard that IF a candidate is deemed triple qualified (academically, physically, and medically -- many are DQd for the slightest medical issue) and IF they are awarded a nomination (not an easy task) THEN the odds of admission can be as great as 50%.

48.<<<aglages>>>
[quote]I believe I've read somewhere that if you are a <b>fully qualified</b> applicant to the USMA (application completed).....your chances for admission (Appointment) are about 50%.[/quote]
I believe in order to be "fully qualified" you must have a nomination. You can't receive an Appointment without one......therefor you are not fully qualified without a nomination. We seem to agree that your odds of admission can be as great as 50%....IF you are fully qualified. I think this number is a more realistic representation of an applicants odds than 9%. As an "expert" at USMA admissions it would be helpful if you gave percentages of those that finish their applications, those that don't pass DoDMERB, aren't academically qualified, or fail the PFT, or those that aren't recommended by their MALO. I stand by my statement that an applicants chances are substantially greater than 9% if all they do is manage to fill out the application. Closer to 50% if they are "fully qualified".

49.<<<jc40>>>
Aplages, last year there were 13,827 applications started for West Point. 4,120 candidates received nominations. 2,360 were deemed academically and physically qualified. 1,257 were accepted.

50.<<<aglages>>>
jc40, of the 13,827 applications (actually files "started") how many filled out more of their applications than the bare minimum (SSN, DOB, HS grad year)?
<url>https://candidate.usma.edu/guest/cq/dad_pcq_part1.cfm?field1=BW</url>

Also didn't the 2,360 who were deemed academically and physically qualified ALSO have nominations (included in the 4,120 nomination stat)?

Weren't there actually more than 1257 that were accepted (received Appointments)? How many reported for R Day vs how many that were actually <u>offered</u> Appointments?

If an applicant does not get into Harvard/Yale/Princeton during his/her first attempt when graduating HS, what's the chances of reapplying the following year and gaining admission? Same as West Point?

Anybody can regurgitate the Class of 2014 USMA profile. Do you have any real insight?

51.<<<jc40>>>
Naturally, there were students who were offered USMA appointments who opted not to go. Some of these had offers at USNA or USAFA and elected to go there or vice versa. The same could be said, though, for ivy cross acceptances. I'm certainly not refuting that it's exceedingly difficult to gain acceptance into an ivy. All I'm saying is that admission to a service academy is no cake walk and is also very challenging. They're interested in a specific type of applicant, and the process is exceedingly long and arduous. This is why many do not follow through and actually complete every phase of the app. It's unlike any other admission process. Our daughter, for instance, applied to med school two years ago. Most would contend that med school apps are among the most tedious and time consuming especially since there are multiple essays which must be written, and applicants must cast a very wide net due to the uber-competitive nature of the process. She was blessed and had multiple offers; however, I would contend our son's experience this past year for the service academies was equally as tedious. Multiple forms had to be signed and submitted, optometry and physician exams had to be completed, fitness tests had to be taken, apps for nominations had to be filed, etc., etc. For us, there was the added documentation for a medical waiver appeal as well. Long story short, he's a happy West Point plebe, but it was most certainly no easy feat. They make the process difficult to ensure only those who are truly dedicated to service are considered.

52.<<<aglages>>>
I will agree with all that you posted. My son is a recent (2015) graduate of USAFA and during the admissions process also received an LOA from the USMA. That said.....the numbers (9% Appointments) are not a direct comparison to Ivy League admissions. Another point that could be made is that many students that have been accepted to Ivy League schools could NOT (if they desired) receive an Appointment to a SA. While most (not all) of those that receive Appointments would have the necessary academic credentials to be accepted to at a least one of the Ivy League schools. JMPO....

53.<<<fleetfeet2016>>>
Well, I get the sense that West Point applicants are highly self-selecting, and so, even if the school accepted a high percentage of "students who actually filled out an application," it wouldn't mean that the student body is suddenly any less accomplished.

I think that military academies deter a lot of students from applying in the first place. I'd imagine a vast number of students never apply because they have absolutely no intention of ever joining the military -- not to mention, most people probably also have no chance of passing the physical fitness exam.

So really, I think it is fair that military academies have a different set of rules when it comes to reporting admissions results. It's not like applying to an Ivy and it shouldn't be treated like it is.

54.<<<VelveteenR>>>
For anyone interested, here are the stats for the incoming USMA class of 2019 as presented in the Welcome Brief to parents by the leader team at R-Day:


<b>Class of 2019 - By the Numbers</b>

14,635 Applicants
3,833 Nominated
2,364 Qualified
1,263 Admitted
1254 SAT Avg
28 ACT Avg
96 Valedictorians
165 Class Presidents
827 Team Captains
1,111 Varsity Letters
278 / 22.0% Women
190 / 15.0% Blacks
144 / 11.3% Hispanics
99 / 7.8 Asian Pacific
17 Intl Cadets
15 Combat Vets

Academically, the class, though strong, is not in the same league as the very top civilian colleges, but academics are only one facet of an SA education. Students at the SAs are there to become officers and leaders in our armed services, and the SAs are tops in producing what they are designed to produce. Applicants to service academies are not asking themselves how the academies rank against the Ivies. They are asking , "Do I want to serve as an officer in one of our military branches?"

If an applicant is concerned about how the SAs stack up against civilian colleges, an SA may not be for that applicant.

55.<<<sattut>>>
Average ACTs of 28 are nowhere near the level of any Ivy. Plus students don't have the time to spend on academics. It is nothing like an Ivy League education.

However, it is certainly true that most students admitted to Ivies wouldn't meet the requirements for West Point. Also, the service academies are effective in what they are designed to do, training military leaders.

The main reason the Naval Academy had 4 Rhodes Scholars is that the criteria for a Rhodes Scholarship are similar to those for admission to a service academy: they require leadership and athletics.

56.<<<aglages>>>
The 28 ACT average is slightly misleading. The ACT/SAT scores of existing service members, recruited athletes and URMs are included in that number. Direct admits that are not in one of those categories have MUCH higher average standardized test scores.

57.<<<sattut>>>
13% of student admitted to Ivies are recruited athletes and they also have many students admitted for various reason s who do not meet the usual requirements.

Service academies are at most the equivalent of a top 30 school, not top Ivies. It is hard to say because it is so different with physical requirements etc., nomination required, no tuition etc. However, many graduates of top 30 schools are doctors and lawyers and such and have similar career levels to service academy graduates.

It is difficult to make it through Ranger school or whatever, but many people who do that are not college level academically, much less West Point level or Harvard level.

That 5:20 mile, 18 pull ups, 75 push ups in 2 mins, 95 modified sit ups in 2 mins, 7.8s shuffle run, and 102 ft kneeling basketball throw. Those are all the maximum that you can do, if you can do that you'll do amazing and fly through all the physical tests that West Point will put you through. I haven't seen anyone actually complete the CFA maxed out though, and while it IS a part of admissions process because West Point is a very physically challenging academy, fitness can be taught. What is more important is the potential for leadership and overall academic achievement with about a 10% weight on your CFA. When I went to West Point for a college visit I asked the Commander how important the CFA is and he told me that while it is important that you are fit, it is more important that you look promising academically and leadership wise.

The difficult part of this discussion is that you can't just look at an acceptance % and compare schools - especially a service academy vs. a civilian university. The application process is completely different and the applicants are completely different. 'Difficulty to get in' can't even really be measured by the acceptance rate, as some people will never apply to one school or the other simply because they KNOW they can't get in. The final number that is spit out for each school is simply a stat for that school and not one to be compared to another.

If the goal here is to tell others how hard it was for you or your son or your daughter to get into the school of their choice, let's just say you can feel confident in your bragging if you/they got into West Point or the Ivy League schools. In either case, it's a wonderful accomplishment and one to be proud of. Plus, anyone who gets into any of those schools is truly the best of the best of young kids in our country - it's a highly selective process that is difficult to navigate and qualify. Add in that the schools will offer a challenging and rewarding environment and produce kids that will go on to do more - a West Point kid is probably very different than a Harvard kid at graduation, but both are an excellent product that are well-prepared to be very successful in life. Great schools; great kids who get in.

With all the comments about leadership, academic ability, and fitness in mind, how far set back would I be in the admissions process if I'm well above average academically, have lead several clubs, performed above average on the CFA, but am only in 1 JV sport without a leadership role? For perspective I've been in this sport sophomore year, junior year, and will be senior year.

@flexagons This wouldn't be another "Chance me" post tacked onto a thread about a different topic......would it?

62.<<<flexagons>>>
@aglages No, the last couple of comments have been about the special admission aspect presented by West Point and not the ivies: the leadership experience required. So I was just wondering how big of a role they play by presenting that situation.

63.<<<usmagrad96>>>
@flexagons - your state has a State Coordinator for West Point who helps kids put their packets together and can identify any areas where additional qualifications are needed. Leadership and athletics certainly help, but a lack of in-depth experience there certainly won't keep you out. It just means your other areas might need to be stronger to compete in the application process. I would encourage you to talk to your school counselor and see if you can make contact with your local State Coordinator. Also, if you get the opportunity, attending Boys/Girls State is a huge bonus. Hope this helps.

USMMA is a great school in its own right. I was class of '72 but quite literally flunked out. Made a career as a Mariner, spent the last 26 years as Master. Retired after 40 years at sea in 2009 and I'm now admitted to UC Berkeley for the Fall 2016 semester to study architecture. Pluck a duck and spruce a goose. KP forever!

I don't think that's necessarily true you have to also get congressional nomination. If it tells you anything a friend of mine's husband applied to the US Naval Academy, Princeton, and Harvard. He was excepted to Harvard but not to Princeton or the Naval Academy. Think if you take all the requirements for both they equal out fairly well. Will agree that some of it is luck as far as whether or not your congressman has a nomination that year and how many students want that nomination.

To say that the service academies don't focus on academics simply means that you don't really know much about the service academies. Despite all the other things cadets go through militarily and physically, the academic standards and expectations are rigorous, and the education you receive is comparable to any top 10 college in the country. The goal of producing military leaders doesn't take away from the quality of education - believe it or not, military leaders need to be just as smart and just as educated as the head of a software company.
