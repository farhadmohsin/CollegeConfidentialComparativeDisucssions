My son got EA from both these schools. We live in NYC so UVA will be a little easier for us to visit, but want the best option for him. He plans on studying Law and Business.
Any feedback on either of these great schools would be appreciated.

2.<<<happy1>>>
I know people who have been very happy at both schools.  Does he want to study business as an undergrad?  If so does he have a direct admit to Ross?  Otherwise I’d look at the acceptance rates into the two b-schools.

3.<<<ThankYouforHelp>>>
I would put them pretty close to equal academically, but they have very different social and academic atmospheres.   Be sure to take that into consideration.   Read the Fiske Guide on both of them.

4.<<<Alexandre>>>
Your son cannot go wrong academically. Both provide excellent undergraduate educations that will prepare him well for graduate school, and both place many students in top law schools and MBA programs. If finances are a concern, go for the more affordable option, otherwise, visit both campuses and let him go with his gut.
As for visiting him, I don’t think UVa is easier. The most convenient way to get to Charlottesville from NYC is by car, a five and a half hour drive. The most convenient way to get to Ann Arbor from NYC is by plane, which also takes roughly five and a half hours door to door. It is more expensive to fly though! 

5.<<<sevmom>>>
Both great  options.  Fit, finances, logistics. Congratulations and good luck with the decision.

6.<<<Penn95>>>
@rugby1  the schools are pretty equivalent in terms of academic quality and standing. If he plans to go to law school a thing to consider is the level of grade inflation in each school, since law schools care a lot about GPA. UVA is known to have big grade inflation. UMich not really.

7.<<<juillet>>>
Your son can’t study law on the undergraduate level - most places do not have law or pre-law majors. If he’s interested in law school, then he should major in something that concentrates on critical and analytical thinking and writing skills.
UVa’s undergraduate program is McIntire is a BA in commerce; you have to earn 54 credits (about two years) before applying, so it’s competitive.
Michigan Ross is discontinuing its Regular Admission program (aka, non-direct admission - when you apply as a freshman or sophomore at Michigan) in favor of its Preferred (direct freshman) Admission program:

[quote]
THE LAST YEAR OF REGULAR ADMISSION WILL BE FOR FALL 2017.
The main pathway to enter the BBA program in Fall 2018 will be Preferred Admission, and Regular Admission will no longer exist. Transfer Admission will still be available for dual degree and undecided U-M students, in addition to external transfer students. For Fall 2018 and forward, Transfer Admission will not be for current U-M students that had previously applied for Preferred Admission for Fall 2017 and forward.
[/quote]

https://michiganross.umich.edu/programs/bba/application-requirements/regular-admission
It looks like there may still be a small loophole - Transfer Admission for undecided UM students - but if you applied for Preferred (direct) admission, you cannot apply again for Transfer Admission. It looks like they are intending transfer admission to be primarily for external transfers (like Michigan CC students) and truly undecided UM students who decided after coming to Michigan that they were interested in business.
That may make a difference, if your son is really deadset on majoring in business/commerce. That said, both UVa and Michigan have a wealth of other majors a student can select that would prepare you for a career in business.
Really, you can’t go wrong. Does he have a preference?

8.<<<IzzoOne>>>
The schools are of a relatively similar level, so I would put that aside and focus on fit.
Michigan moving to direct admission for B-school as indicated above for UVA is apply after earning 54 credits.
Train is a reasonable option from Charlottesville to NYC.  About 6.5 hours.

9.<<<rugby1>>>
Thank you for the great reply’s . He is wait mode now for the 12 other schools he applied regular admission.

10.<<<rugby1>>>
he wanted U Penn but got deferred

11.<<<merc81>>>
Michigan grads tend to do well when applying to both law and MBA programs:

12.<<<TooOld4School>>>
If your son is admitted to Ross when decisions come out, I would attend Michigan. If not, UVa may be a better choice.

13.<<<ryanordy88>>>
Since your son is interested in Penn, I think Michigan sounds like the better choice, in my opinion. Michigan is basically Penn, but bigger, with a better student spirit, and not as much prestige–albeit still a great school. Michigan and Penn also have a major called PPE, which combines philosophy, economics, and political science in one major. Since your son is interested in both law and business, this major may interest your son. I applied ED to Penn also, as a PPE major, and got rejected.
Also, I think Michigan is easier to get to than UVA. Michigan is just a flight into Detroit and then like a 40 minute car ride. Charlottesville is in the middle of nowhere, and it may be harder to get to.

14.<<<Much2learn>>>
Both excellent schools, but I would say that Michigan would be more similar to Penn too.
Keep in mind that a reasonable number of Penn applicants who are deferred do get admitted in the regular admission round, so that may happen too. There is definitely a fair amount of overlap between Penn and Michigan student.
UVA definitely has more of a Southern feel, if that is interesting to him. It depends on what is comfortable for your student.

15.<<<firstwavemom>>>
My D also admitted to UVA and Michigan.  We are OOS she has been admitted to other schools as well, but has not made her decision.
I am a graduate of UVA’s Mcintire School of Commerce (admit rate is like 60% now and there is a tuition bump of 5K if you attend McIntire for your 3rd and 4th year, so that is something to consider).  Back in the day, The Comm School was amazing–great professors, case studies/group work, and a smaller school within the larger university).  Now, the school is state of the art and job prospects or grads are great.  I also think there is pre-law advising at UVA, which may be helpful.  Of course, my preference is UVA.  Charlottesville is a great college town and, at 16K students vs. 26K students, is much smaller than Michigan.  Most of my classes were pretty small (except Econ 201, etc.) and I think they are even more keyed-in on low faculty to student ratio now.  The campus is beautiful and historic.  She visited Michigan in Feb last year and it was -10.  Charlottesville weather is more mild of course.  As an alum, I am really hoping our March visit for Days on the Lawn is impressive and that D chooses UVA–not just because her mom attended!  Wahoowa!

16.<<<Alexandre>>>
ryanordy98, Penn’s prestige edge over Michigan is limited to the uninformed (high school kids and impressionable parents). In academia and industry, Michigan and Penn are equally prestigious, although Wharton is obviously more prestigious than Ross and Michigan’s CoE is similarly more prestigious than Penn’s SEAS.
Also, the Detroit Metropolitan Airport is 20 miles away from Ann Arbor, and seldom takes more than 20-25 minutes to travel by car, except during rush hour.
As for Michigan vs UVa, they are peers academically. I would recommend going for fit as they are significantly different from each other.

17.<<<blueorchid90>>>
My D is also deciding between Umich and UVa. We are also vising both campuses in March and hoping for the gut feeling to guide my D. She will be majoring in math/sciences and hopefully taking the the premed track. @Penn95 and others who know: we are concerned about grade deflation. Can you please comment how significant it is and why?

18.<<<rugby1>>>
thank you this was great feedback. The plan is to see what other options he has after April 1 and then sit down narrow it down then go visit them. He is high on Washington University and thoughts on that option?

19.<<<happy1>>>
If you are taking about Wash U (St. Louis) that would be another outstanding choice.  I agree with your game plan about waiting until all the decisions are in and then visiting the top choices.

20.<<<rugby1>>>
It is Wash U they required an on site interview.

21.<<<rugby1>>>
Here is his full list
Brandeis University
Cornell University
Dartmouth College
Duke U: All Undergrad
Emory University
Georgetown University
Johns Hopkins University
Northwestern University
Tufts University
Univ of Michigan
Univ of Pennsylvania
Washington University: St. Louis
Yale University
Univ Virginia

22.<<<rugby1>>>
Got into John Hopkins and waitlist at Washington University. Don’t understand

23.<<<Alexandre>>>
What do you not understand?

24.<<<rugby1>>>
how he got accepted to JHU and wait listed at washu when the admission requirements are higher

25.<<<Alexandre>>>
rugby, WUSTL and JHU have similar admission standards. At that level, the decision is random, to a degree anyway.

26.<<<rugby1>>>
anyway Son very happy!!

27.<<<Alexandre>>>
As well he should be. Your son’s acceptances are excellent.

28.<<<rugby1>>>
Its getting close to the end and knowing what options he has. With what we know so far its going to be hard for him to pick.
Brandeis University                    accepted Honors scholarship
Cornell University
Dartmouth College
Duke U: All Undergrad
Emory University                        Accepted
Georgetown University                Accepted
Johns Hopkins University           Accepted
Northwestern University
Tufts University
Univ of Michigan                          Accepted
Univ of Pennsylvania                   Waitlisted
Washington University: St. Louis Waitlisted
Yale University
Univ Virginia                                 Accepted

29.<<<CathJR>>>
How do you already know waitlisted at Penn? Those decisions haven’t come out yet.

30.<<<rugby1>>>
he did ED at Penn.

31.<<<CathJR>>>
@rugby1 Then he would currently deferred. Waitlistings only occur after rd.

32.<<<Alexandre>>>
Some Ivy League schools respond earlier. My nephew received an acceptance from Cornell in mid March last year.

33.<<<CathJR>>>
@Alexandre Then he probably got a likely letter. To be part of the Ivy League officially schools cannot released before an agreed upon date, which last year was March 31 and this year is March 30.

34.<<<rugby1>>>
I understand it Thursday the 30th this year.

35.<<<Alexandre>>>
CathJR, it was an acceptance, and he received the acceptance letter (not likely letter), in mid March. I realize that is highly unusual since the Ivy League generally send out their decisions in large March, but I suppose their are exceptions.

36.<<<CathJR>>>
@Alexandre Maybe there are loopholes but sending out actual decisions before Ivy day is supposed to void their Ivy contract or whatever it is.

37.<<<rugby1>>>
So my post started with a choose between Michigan and Virginia, now with all the results in. He wants to see Hopkins and Georgetown.

38.<<<Alexandre>>>
rugby, in the initial post you wrote that your son wanted to study business or law. I think Georgetown, Michigan and UVa are better options than JHU.
McDonough, McIntire and Ross are three top 10 BBA programs, JHU does not have an established business program.
Georgetown, Michigan and UVa have T14 Law schools of their own, and those Law schools seem to give preference to applicants from their own respective colleges. Also, all three seem to be better represented at other top law schools than JHU.

39.<<<rugby1>>>
His feeling about JHU is that its overall ranking is higher. We are going to Georgetown this week for their open house. Thank you for this feedback.

40.<<<Alexandre>>>
Rankings are not accurate to that level. All of those universities are ranked within 15 spots of each other, our of thousands of universities. That makes them peers. He should focus on cost of attendance, and if that is not a concern, then on academic and social fit.

41.<<<HRSMom>>>
Michigan has a kick arse rugby team:)

42.<<<Alexandre>>>
Note that “arse” was spelled correctly in rugby context.
But seriously, Michigan has the highest ranked law school in this group (usually regarded as a top 6 or 7 law school by Big Law), and they admit roughly 70-80 Michigan graduates annually.

43.<<<rugby1>>>
His interests does not run to rugby, like his father’s did at the time. JHU is award is very generous and still have not seen GT. But like the idea of being able to jump in the car and being there in 4 hours.

44.<<<HRSMom>>>
@Alexandre did not know that abt the 70/80.  My S is making noises about law school…

45.<<<Alexandre>>>
Most years, 40-50 Michigan graduates enroll in Michigan Law School, but many more are admitted and choose to go elsewhere. Typically, 20 enroll at HYS Law schools, and another 40-50 enroll in other T-14 Law schools. The last three years, over 90% of Michigan students who apply to Law schools are accepted into at least one program. Georgetown and UVa have equally impressive placements.

46.<<<ThankYouforHelp>>>
Michigan Law grad here.  Just to clarify, Michigan Law accepts a lot of people from its undergrad, but that is because they are residents of the State of Michigan, not because they went to U of M.  There is a preference for in-state students, and they always make up about 20 percent of the law school class.   You don’t become a resident by going to the U of M as an undergrad, so I’m not sure that an out of state student would have any admissions advantage by having gone there.
I suspect that UVa is the same.

47.<<<Alexandre>>>
ThankYouforHelp, you make a good point, although residents make up 65% of LSA students, so it stands to reason that a large portion of Michigan graduates who enroll at Michigan Law are residents. I doubt the Law School distinguishes based on resident status. Other than the Medical school, graduate programs at Michigan are not obligated to admitting residents.

48.<<<ThankYouforHelp>>>
Agreed.  I’m pretty sure Law School admissions distinguishes a little - the last thing you want to do is aggravate the Michigan Legislature.  

49.<<<rugby1>>>
We did the admitted students visit at both GT and JHU, he liked both the money is the same. I think he is leaning JHU, because its not as religious. He was a little put off by the Crucifix in the classrooms.

50.<<<areid411>>>
He can’t go wrong with either schools but I think Mich is better. It has everything anyone could want in a school and its top notch
