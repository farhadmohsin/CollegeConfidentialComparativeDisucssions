1.<<<sheilsarda>>>
I'm interested in computer science, but not decided on the Wharton side for M&T. If I were to go to Yale, I would pursue a biomedical engineering and computer science double major. My primary goal coming out of college is to become the best engineer, but very passionate about entrepreneurship as a career path.

2.<<<sheilsarda>>>
Just to clarify, my main concern is with academics and campus culture at both schools, with grade inflation, undergraduate focus, etc.

3.<<<Penn95>>>
@sheilsarda For all these areas (CS, bioengineering, CS, entrepreneurship and business) Penn is stronger. Also specifically the M&amp;T program is a really unique program that opens amazing doors in business and tech.
If you see that you are not interested in the Wharton part anymore, then you can get out of M&amp;T and do a dual major in CS and Bioengineering.

Unless you rally fit in better at Yale and you cannot see yourself at Penn, I would pick Penn because it is stronger for engineering and business and also because of the unique strengths of the M&amp;T program.


Campus culture and vibe is different between the two schools. Penn has a strong pre-professional element (business,s engineering), it focuses more on the application of knowledge and interdisciplinary education. It also ha a more vibrant social life and is located in a big city but also has a defined camps.

Yale is more intellectual, has that old-school classic ivy-league/hogwarts type of vibe, is located in a much smaller city. The most popular major at Yale is history. Also it has a smaller undergrad population than Penn.

4.<<<sheilsarda>>>
@Penn95 Thank you for the edit, that answers my question about culture.

5.<<<Penn95>>>
@sheilsarda I faced the same dilemma when making my college choice. I ultimately chose Penn because i felt the engineering and business offerings were superior and also because Penn was still strong overall and I felt I would have a well-rounded education. And i did. The Penn curriculum is very flexible and you can take courses in all undergraduate and graduate schools at Penn and there is still room to take electives. Also it is strong across the board so I don't think you would be getting a more well-rounded education at Yale. That said the academic focus at Yale is different. More theoretical. In terms of grade inflation, Yale a more grade-inflated.

6.<<<sheilsarda>>>
@Penn95 What do you think about Yale being more undergraduate-focused in their STEM departments, given that it's much smaller than that of Penn.

7.<<<Penn95>>>
@sheilsarda Personally i feel undergrad focus is a rather vague term. Penn engineering has about 435 students per class while Yale has 108. Still you will have access to professors, TAs at both. I never felt i didn't have access to my professors at Penn and all classes are taught by professors who also hold regular office hours. The fact that there are more students interested in STEM meant more STEM- oriented student organizations and more like-minded people to learn from. Penn engineering is still at a very manageable size (435 per class is not a lot) but also quite diverse because of its size. Also i feel the research opportunities and stem-related extracurricular involvement are more robust and diverse.

8.<<<reuynshard>>>
Difference in faculty strengths for CS are negligible: (US News Ranks: #19 vs #20). Biomedical engineering at Yale it is a small program, but builds on its world leading Biology, Medicine and Chemistry departments, which are all top 10-12 in the world, and the research by faculty is cutting edge. (Check out Mark Saltzmann and Andre Levchenko's research, as well the the Yale West Campus among other things). I presume Biomedical Engineering at Penn isn't an option for you, but the curriculum requirements are broadly similar anyway.

If you're interested in entrepreneurship, Wharton definitely has a much larger group of people with like minded interests, but Yale also sees its fair share of startups. The Yale Entrepreneurial Institute gives out tons of money each year and there are lots of companies that start off as collaborations between undergraduates, medical school, law school and business school students.

If you want to be the best engineer, I would suggest Yale even though Penn might have a larger engineering program, because the Jerome Fisher program has a huge number of requirements that are economics/finance based. At Yale you could devote that time to engineering/math/science courses instead if you wish.

The campus culture at both schools is mostly defined by the mix of majors. At Yale more students tend to be involved in the arts and government as well as public service. At Penn, you'll find more students interested in finance, business, etc. There will be lots of science geeks at both places at well. Lastly, Penn has a much larger number of students (24,000+) vs Yale (12,000), and Yale also has a residential college program, which might mean a smaller, more intimate atmosphere for undergrads.

9.<<<Penn95>>>
@sheilsarda For entrepreneurship, you would have all the Wharton resources but also Penn engineering offers an engineering entrepreneurship minor.
Here is a report on the colleges with the biggest/most successful entrepreneurial activity:
<url>https://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2015_2016_Edition.pdf</url>

Biomedical engineering is definitely an option for you, and it builds on Penn's world renowned hospital and medical school. There is a lot of cutting edge research happening through collaborations between the engineering and medical school at Penn. For example: <url>https://news.upenn.edu/news/university-pennsylvania-celebrate-launch-penn-center-health-devices-and-technology</url>

If you want to be the best engineer, I feel it is best to go where the most engineering opportunities are available. The M&amp;T program has a lot of business requirements, it is dual degree after all, but if you see that you are no longer interested in the business part you can just drop it and focus on engineering.

This was a article about Yale CS: <url>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-after-yale-good-luck-with-that</url>

At the end of the day however, fit is very important. I feel the biggest point that you d have to understand is the difference is academic culture and student interests between the two schools. Both are excellent choices.

Where do you see yourself fitting best?

10.<<<Penn95>>>
@sheilsarda another Yale vs Penn thread you might find useful
<url>https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/1985777-yale-vs-penn-p1.html</url>

11.<<<sheilsarda>>>
@reuynshard @Penn95 Thank you so much! So many good reasons on both sides.

12.<<<ny23456>>>
^ It's worth noting that Penn95 (if the name is correct) has graduated from Penn more than 2 decades ago. A lot has changed in both universities since then.

The Bloomberg article gets several things wrong (especially the title). I have a son each at Yale and Stanford, and virtually all my son's peers who wanted silicon valley internships got one. For instance, Facebook, Google and Microsoft were among the top-10 employers at the school last year, while several others are in CS grad programs at Berkeley, MIT and Columbia.
(<url>http://ocs.yale.edu/connect/statistics</url>).

Yale is also expanding both it's engineering and CS faculty, and they have already grown by 20-30% across all departments over the last few years.

13.<<<Penn95>>>
@ny23456 this is wrong I graduated from Penn within the last 4 years. The 95 on my username isn't my graduation year, it was just random when making a username.

14.<<<nw2this>>>
What are your preferences in terms of campus culture?

15.<<<sheilsarda>>>
@nw2this in general, I prefer a structured and driven environment that motivates me to work. I enjoy meeting new people on campus, but tend to gel with people who have similar interests. My main concern with yale and Penn respectively, is Yale's residential college system forcing me to stay with random roommates for a year who'll probably not be in my major given how small engineering is,and at Penn, it's the extreme rigor and workload of the program creating a toxic environment that discourages friendship and collaboration.

Are my concerns well-founded?

16.<<<sheilsarda>>>
@ny23456 thanks for the clarification. What did your son like most about Yale? Also, how would you compare his experience to that at Penn?

17.<<<Penn95>>>
@sheilsarda Penn is rigorous but not extremely so. Also there is no toxic environment that discourages friendship and collaboration. Quite the opposite, people are very friendly and actually collaborate with each other a lot and help out each other. Penn students are competitive with themselves, and like to push themselves to achieve more, but they are not competitive/cutthroat against each other. Especially engineering students are highly collaborative. there is the mentality that engineering is tough and we are all in this together and we are all better off helping each other to get through it. The M&amp;T program specifically provides really amazing guidance and mentorship. There is an entire M&amp;T office at Penn dedicated to providing professional and academic guidance only to M&amp;T students and also organizing M&amp;T student and alumni events very often. The M&amp;T community is a small,intimate and very close-knit community both on campus and with its alumni base.

Regarding your concerns about the Yale Residential system, can you designate what kind roommates you would prefer?

18.<<<sheilsarda>>>
They do take into consideration general preferences, but the process is essentially randomized for freshman, and you're assigned either a single or double in a suite of around five or six.

19.<<<Penn95>>>
Hmm i see.

Look, at the end of the day you need to evaluate where you will be happier and more able to reach your potential as a student and a person.

Feel free to ask me any more questions about Penn.

And let us know what you end up choosing!

20.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@penn95 were you rejected by Yale? It would explain a lot. I can summarize the vast majority of your posts as follows: "Stanford top in the country, now eclipsing Harvard, Yale way overrated, Penn better than you think, UChicago not as good as its fans think".

Most of your posts are very long on unsupported assertions but short on facts, from what I can tell. @reuynshard's post is a helpful corrective. Yale's bioengineering (which is, after all, what OP asked about) and medical school are quite strong.

21.<<<Penn95>>>
@DeepBlue86 Take it easy with the personal attacks buddy. Not that it is any of your business, but I was accepted by Yale and chose Penn for the reasons I mentioned above. Please point me to where my posts are short on facts? In fact I happen to think that all/most of my posts are supported by facts. Just cause you don't agree with what I am saying it does not mean it is not true. So please enlighten me.
You find the other post helpful because it matches your opinion. Now who is being biased and short on facts?

22.<<<nw2this>>>
M &amp; T would give you the group of people with similar interests, the structured driven enviroment, collaboration and very likely friendships. You can find roommates with similar interests on Facebook or try the themed housing.

23.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
No facts, just assertions in your posts 2, 4 and 6. 8 is one-sided, but at least there are some citations. I think that most of those who are in the clear minority that chooses Penn over Yale do it because they prefer an undergraduate business degree at Wharton, or a dual-degree program. Not a clear argument to do it for bioengineering, or CS either.

Like I've said on other threads, you have an obvious agenda in your almost 1,500 posts, which is as I summarized above. There's nothing special about this thread; it's just the one where I chose to comment on it.

24.<<<Penn95>>>
@DeepBlue86 Not quite, what you are describing is the choice between Harvard/Stanford vs Penn. For Yale quite a few people also choose Penn simply for engineering, in addition to Wharton and dual degrees. As for M&amp;T cross admits routinely choose Penn over Yale. (M&amp;T people who turn down Penn most often go to Stanford, MIT and even less so Harvard, it is practically never Yale). The cross-admit split of Penn vs Yale is not as clear a minority as that of Harvard/Stanford vs Penn.

Regarding my so-called assertions, do you dispute that Penn has a stronger engineering school than Yale? (open any ranking out there, research funding stats etc). Or that there are more engineering offerings and STEM-oriented student clubs/organizations at Penn? Or do you dispute that Penn is more pre-professionally and practically minded than Yale?

Penn has about 37 engineering student organizations, Yale has about 17. Penn organizes the biggest college hackathon in the world, PennApps.
Yale offers 3 ABET-accredited BSE engineering degrees, Penn offers 10.


But as I said above quite a few times, fit is even more important than all else and I have repeatedly urged @sheilsarda to consider fit and the differences of culture between the schools.

25.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I'm talking specifically about bioengineering, which is, after all, OP's concern. It's not at all obvious that Penn is stronger there.

If you don't believe the Parchment data that somewhere between half and two-thirds of Penn-Yale cross-admits choose Yale, we're going to have to agree to disagree. And, assuming you accept that Yale wins on cross-admits, if you don't believe that a large chunk of what Penn gets is due to kids choosing Wharton...again, we'll have a difference of opinion.

I entirely agree that Penn is more pre-professional than Yale - that's why a lot of people turn it down. I know many - I would guess hundreds - of people who went to Penn; you're the first I've met who I'm aware turned down Yale to do so, but perhaps I should get out more.

26.<<<nw2this>>>

<url>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/engineering-doctorate-biological-biomedical</url>

27.<<<Penn95>>>
@DeepBlue86
Maybe you should get out more, cause there are quite a few.

Please don't distort my words, where did i say that a lot of it is not due to Wharton? Of course it is. But it is also due to engineering. I do believe the Parchment data, where the split is 58%-42% in favor of Yale (although the split is not statistically significant according to parchment). The difference is driven primarily by liberal arts and pure sciences admits who would choose Yale much more, but Yale loses a big chunk of the engineering and business admits to Penn. It is precisely because it has an edge in these preprofessional areas than Penn is able to attract more cross-admits. By comparison the split between Harvard vs Penn and Stanford vs Penn is 77% vs 23% and 72% vs 28% and is statistically significant. And this is because it cannot attract as many of these admits from Stanford and Harvard.

We are talking about engineering in general, op is not exactly set on bioengineering. but even for bioengineering, while the difference is not huge, Penn is still ranked higher and in combination with its stronger medical school and hospital and higher research funding in this field, it can be argued that it has an good edge.

28.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@Penn95, re: the first line of your post, I'd love to see the numbers; absent that, I'll regard it as another unsupported assertion. Apart from that:
[quote]I do believe the Parchment data, where the split is 58%-42% in favor of Yale (although the split is not statistically significant according to parchment).[/quote]

This is inaccurate; according to Parchment, at a 95% confidence level, Yale gets between 67% and 49%. The rest of that paragraph is speculation. In any case, I'm certainly not "distorting [your] words", just observing that some cross-admits undoubtedly choose Penn for Wharton, since Yale doesn't have an undergraduate business major.

Finally, there's no major difference on bioengineering or on medical schools, where both Penn and Yale are top-ten. If you're going to hang everything on rankings, it looks like a lot of Penn and Yale grads didn't get the memo that they should have gone to Georgia Tech or UCSD for bioengineering.

29.<<<Penn95>>>
@DeepBlue86 we are saying the same thing. here is the link to the parchment college matchup tool.
<url>http://www.parchment.com/c/college/tools/college-cross-admit-comparison.php?compare=Yale+University&amp;with=University+of+Pennsylvania</url>

The split based on their data is 58% vs 42%, and based on that and the statistical method they are using, they estimate the actual split to be between 67% vs 33%(Yale vs Penn) and 49.2% vs 50.8% (Yale vs Penn).

I definitely agree with you that a lot of the cross admits Penn is able to attract is due to Wharton, never disputed that.

For undergrad both overall undergraduate quality/ standing and specific departmental strength matter. This is why it is not uncommon for people to choose Penn or Yale over much better engineering schools like Gtech and UIUC.
I agree the difference it is not big, but it is there.
Regarding medical school/hospital, by the sam logic Yale law and Penn Law are both top 10, caN one say that there is so difference? Same for Wharton vs SOM. Sure for medical school and hospital strength the difference is not big but it is there.

30.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I know what Parchment says, @Penn95 - I quoted it to you. It says that there's an overwhelming likelihood that Yale gets half to two-thirds of cross-admits - and, conversely, a negligible likelihood that Penn gets more than half - surprising no one. And we're apparently in violent agreement that a lot of what Penn gets is due to Wharton.

Yale and Penn's bioengineering programs and med schools appear to be in the same band, such that I don't believe there's a big difference between them. This is why I'm saying that if you wouldn't pick Georgia Tech or UCSD for undergrad bioengineering, then you're picking Yale or Penn for other reasons than pure excellence in that narrow field. On the other hand, I believe Yale Law (top in the country) is clearly better than Penn Law, and Wharton (arguably top three) is clearly better than Yale SOM, so the choices would be much more straightforward.

31.<<<Penn95>>>
@DeepBlue86 yes of course. I never said Penn wins the cross-admit battle against Yale, i simply said that it gets a sizable piece, 50%- 30% is a sizable piece. Also yes a lot of it is Wharton but it is not only Wharton. With Harvard &amp; Stanford it is practically only Wharton and dual degrees, with Yale it is engineering students as well.

I never said the choice between the two schools should be based solely on the difference in bioengineering. but i just laid out the fact that Penn has consistently been ranked higher for bioengineering, medical school and its hospitals and tends to get more research funding in the field. But i do agree with you that it is not a substantial difference. And definitely not a substantial difference to base a choice of college on.

If you have noticed i keep emphasizing fit to the OP in every other post, as i think this is the main consideration.

32.<<<renaissancedad>>>
^ I don't think the above conversation helps the OP much with her decision. I would suggest staying on point.

Most people consider the residential colleges to be one of the strongest points about Yale. They tend to foster a great sense of community, and make the university more accessible. Freshmen are generally undeclared, and the majority of them are not physically housed in the residential college itself (depending on the college), so you would almost certainly be with "random roommates we'll probably not be in my major". Many students change prospective majors. All of that is part of the experience of being at a school with a strong liberal arts focus.

I'm a huge fan of Penn's dual degree programs, for the right students. Those students are usually very focused and motivated, and are ready to jump in from day 1. If you know you want to combine engineering and entrepreneurship, and like the idea of being with a elite cohort of similar students, it's hard to beat M&amp;T. The program will certain have extreme rigor and a heavy workload, but I don't get the sense that most people find the environment toxic.

Both are amazing schools, but very different experiences (especially with M&amp;T factored in). I would think it depends on whether you want a more focused, intense experience in your subjects of interest with a lot of resources and a program tailored to your interests, or a broader, more liberal arts based experience, where you will have to carve out your own path.

I hope this helps.

33.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
This seems right to me. Yale's residential system (which, as @renaissancedad says,most people would say is one of Yale's crown jewels and unique strengths) is arguably the best for the average college student who isn't certain going in what they want to study and isn't looking to spend most of their time with other people in their chosen program (I believe upwards of two-thirds of Yale students change their intended major). The idea is that living with a variety of people studying various things, in a smaller community (the residential college, which you're affiliated with whether or not you live in it as a freshman), is part of your education. Penn is a much more pre-professional environment, and that's what some students undoubtedly prefer and thrive in.

34.<<<Parapraxes>>>
N.B. Not sure I trust Parchment, which reports that Columbia takes 15% of cross-admits with Stanford; UCLA, 12%, Berkeley, 13%; Duke, 15%; Brown, 21%; Penn, 28%; USC, 9%. The linked document suggests that each of these schools claimed less than 10% of cross-admits in 2014, when Stanford had a lower yield rate.

<url>https://stanford.app.box.com/s/y4abufqg66nte7uax6eq</url>

N.B.II. 95% confidence intervals notwithstanding.

N.B.III. Suspect that the Stanford data are completer and more comprehensive than those for most other schools.

35.<<<Cue7>>>
@Parapraxes

Your post shows just how strong the "HYMPS" designation is. Further, Admissions Dean Richard Shaw talks about the admissions "systems" at the top 5 being quite similar, so that the overlap is highest here (p. 24 of @Penn95 - a good sign for Penn!).

The data is sobering, however. Stanford now takes 42% of cross-admits with Harvard (up from 35% in years past), and takes the big majority from everywhere else. Dean Shaw even says that, outside of HYMP, no school takes more than "single digit percentages" from Stanford. With Penn at #11 in Stanford's top competitor pool, and not taking more than 9.9% of cross-admits (in past years, Shaw actually posted the data - and Penn took 2%, but recently he's stopped even bothering posting data from non-HYMP schools), it means maybe only 5-15 students at Penn turn down Stanford a year.


BRINGING THIS BACK around to the discussion about Yale - it's important to remember the numbers here. As Yale has about a 70% yield rate, and its admissions system resembles Stanford, it stands to reason that it loses the biggest chunk (60-70%) of its cross-admit pool to HMPS. So, for the 600 students who don't choose Yale, HMPS probably gets about 400 of them. There are then only 200 Yale admits who choose to go elsewhere.

Of that 200, if Penn does phenomenally well, it brings in what, 20 students? (That would be an extraordinary haul, btw, because it means of the 300+ colleges in america that could be competing for the 200 yale cross-admits not choosing HMPS, Penn would get 10% of them.) So, all should keep in mind that the universe we're talking about here is super small.

In choosing for fit (which is the key when choosing between somewhat like institutions): Yale has released the survey results from their mental health survey, and the data can be found here: <url>https://static1.squarespace.com/static/586d882946c3c40a1c57b1ee/t/5875baf06a49630b1d28f122/1484110581172/YCC-Mental-Health-Report-1ms1ra1.pdf</url>

Penn, unfortunately, has not released its own survey results, just its recommendations for an overhaul, as seen here: <url>https://billypenn.com/2015/02/23/experts-students-mystified-by-penn-suicide-task-forces-change-the-culture-mandate-how-exactly-do-you-do-that/</url>

There are overlaps between Yale's extensive report and Penn's (incomplete) reporting - both schools stress excellence across many sectors, although social endeavors receive more attention in the Penn report. Further, at Penn, the importance of seeming "perfect" seems more pronounced, whereas at Yale, there seems to be more pressure to appear "happy."

You can also sift through school cultural/inclusion climate reports. You can find Yale's here: <url>http://provost.yale.edu/title-ix/yale-report-aau-campus-climate-survey</url> and UPenn's here: <url>http://www.upenn.edu/ir/surveys/AAU/Report and Tables on AAU Campus Climate Survey.pdf</url>

Lots of info to sift through!

36.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@Parapraxes @Cue7 - there's a related debate on a different thread, so I'm going to cross-post something here:
[quote]I continue to wonder where Stanford gets the above information (I don't know what the abbreviations for the sources at the bottom of the slide mean). I'm not an expert, but it seems to me it might not be legal for universities to share with each other who got in and went where. If they can't do that, the data must be self-reported by the students, in which case how can it be reliable or complete?

Also, I wonder how Stanford characterizes a student who gets into, say, Harvard, Yale and Stanford, and enrolls at Harvard. It's a win for Harvard in cross-admits with Stanford, but how does Stanford reflect that the student was a Yale-Stanford cross-admit and chose to attend neither school? Also, is there double-counting in the total numbers of cross-admits (i.e., does that kid show up as a Stanford cross-admit with both Harvard and Yale)?

In this regard, the Today Show reported this morning that the set of quadruplets who all were admitted to Harvard and Yale (and at least one of which was also admitted to Stanford) have all chosen Yale (see the thread on this subject, also here: <url>http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/college-game-plan/ohio-quadruplets-accepted-ivies-will-attend-yale-together-n753146</url>) - so I guess there's a real-life illustration of the problem in accounting for cross-admits to multiple places.

Finally, as I've said elsewhere, assuming the numbers on the Stanford slide are correct, a 10% swing in any direction with any school looks like a big shift but represents 21 or fewer people. Given that HYPS all have 70-80% yields, the overlap in the admitted students must be small. Also, I would guess, many students give a lot of weight to geography in making their decision. I would be very interested to know the choices of Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and West Coast students cross-admitted with Stanford and any of HYP.[/quote]

Note that those quadruplets all by themselves probably represent a ~2% shift to Yale in its cross-admit match-up with Harvard, which illustrates how small the actual cross-admit numbers are and how little one can read into cross-admit trends.

@Cue7 - thanks for all that very useful information.

37.<<<Cue7>>>
@DeepBlue86 - yes, I think it's key to see just how SMALL the universe of cross-admits is. Even amongst the top 5 schools, the actual numbers are pretty tiny (say 50-100 students actively deciding between a couple top 5s).

Below the top 5 schools, then, the number of cross-admits going to any other school is really small - like in the single and low double digits.

It is amazing - as HYMPS have similar admissions "systems," out of, say, the 1-2 million people applying to US colleges in any given year, only about 8,000-9,000 are truly in the running at the top 5. That's maybe only an eighth of a percent of the applicant pool! This speaks to:

1.) the selectivity at the tippy top AND

2.) a narrow-mindedness in what the top schools seek. Dean Shaw, in the Stanford Report, noted that he needs to come up with reasons why a student is accepted at Stanford and not Harvard, and faculty question him on it. I'm not sure it's a good thing that all top schools now define "excellence" in the same narrow way.

38.<<<Chrchill>>>
@Penn95 kill me now. But you are right. In life / medical sciences, engineering and entrepreneurship, Penn wins over Yale. The combination of its top five medical school, Wharton resources and courses and top engineering school are top of the line. UChicago has no engineering and its life sciences/ medical school are its relative weak spot. UChicago is not in the conversation for these subjects.

39.<<<reuynshard>>>
@Chrchill that really depends. If you're talking about life sciences, Yale is considered significantly better than Penn (US News Ranks #7 vs #19). Penn might have a marginally better medical school, but that doesn't have much relevance for undergrad admissions.
.

40.<<<Chrchill>>>
I am talking about the combination of all three: entreneurship, life science and engineering. And it hurts me inside to support @Penn95

41.<<<Cue7>>>
Don't sweat it @Chrchill - in real numbers, maybe only 15-20 cross admits at Yale and upenn chose Penn. So the numbers are real small.

And fear not, after those students come to Penn, they get so caught up in the state school-like party culture that their only viable post grad options involve making you drinks.

42.<<<Chrchill>>>
Believe me -- I have no dog (dogue) in this fight.

43.<<<nw2this>>>
What was your final choice?

44.<<<Penn95>>>
@reuynshard for biorngineering Penn is substantially better though (#8 vs #30 for yale i think). The medical school adds really top research opportunities and has been consistently higher ranked and producing more research, but that is a smaller difference.

@Cue7 in real numbers there are probably very few Yale Penn cross admits to begin with, i agree.

Also are you serious about your party and career outcome comments?! i mean you have to be joking... otherwise this is laughable...what are you even talking about?

@Chrchill lol i am actually touched. i know how hard it must have been for you to write these words haha

45.<<<sheilsarda>>>
@Chrchill @reuynshard @Cue7 @Penn95 @DeepBlue86 @nw2this thank you for your excellent advice, chock full of relevant stats ;)

In the end, I chose Penn M&amp;T, and will try my best to make the best of this opportunity!

46.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
Congratulations, @sheilsarda - all the choices were great, and you'll certainly do well at Penn.

47.<<<Penn95>>>
@sheilsarda congrats! welcome to Penn! . best of luck and feel free to ask any questions about Penn.

48.<<<Cue7>>>
@Penn95 - hah yes my comment re @Chrchill was indeed a joke. On a past thread, he discussed how, since he's a Harvard graduate, graduates from other schools serve him. So the Chicago grad is a chess partner, the Penn grad serves drinks, I think the Cornell grad did the landscaping... All very tongue in cheek.

49.<<<Cue7>>>
And @sheilsarda - welcome to UPenn - M&amp;T is excellent, and I think they even have their own discrete space on campus. So you'll have a little network within a larger one.

50.<<<Chrchill>>>
Princeton does the landscaping.

@Penn95 My dear friend. Don't get overly excited, I would take UChicago for everything else over Penn. But credit where credit is due.

@Chrchill why would Princeton do the landscaping? Cornell has the Agriculture school, with a plant sciences department.

Maybe the Princeton grad could organize your lawn parties. (<url>https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/35/56/39/355639973ab9a1d757d35c815e5f2052.jpg</url>)

Well, @Cue7, since your comments yesterday I've been thinking about how you square the similarity of process with the apparent low numbers of cross-admits in the HYPMS admissions "system". Here's my *very* rough description of what I think is going on, using made-up (but I believe plausible) numbers - please correct me if you disagree.

The population that applies to HYPSM each year consists of, I'm going to guess, something around 125,000 unique applicants, competing for something over 9,000 total offers of admission, with total freshman enrollment at the five schools of something over 7,000 (i.e., there are about 2,000 cross-admits across the five schools). I'll guess that half of the applicants are unqualified and are denied on first reading. Then let's say that across the five schools 850 of the slots go to recruited athletes and a similar number go to legacies. I'll assume that one in five of these gets one cross-admit to another school in the group (bearing in mind that although the athletes are talented, they're mostly recruited early and often don't apply to more than one of HYPMS, and although the legacies may be high-quality, the hook only works in one place). I'll assume 2,400 other HYPSM legacies are denied at their legacy school as well as all the other four. So now we're at 58,400 remaining applicants for 7,960 remaining offers.

Bear with me at this point - I'm going to allude to race, but I believe my points are noncontroversial, and I apologize if I inadvertently offend anyone. I'm not aiming to provoke a discussion about race in college admissions, or to opine about what colleges should be doing in this area, so I hope no one will go there.

I estimate there are about 1,200 URM matriculants among HYPSM in each year. The population of URMs that test in the top 1% of their racial group is, I estimate, a few thousand. I believe a large number of these academically elite URMs who apply to any of HYPSM will get an offer, and that they are very likely to be cross-admitted. Let's say 600 of the academically tippy-top URMs apply to at least one of HYPSM and get 1.5 offers each on average. The remainder of the admitted URMs overlap with other groups described herein. This takes us to something like 57,800 remaining applicants for 7,060 remaining offers.

Now to the ORMs. Of the ~125,000 unique applicants to HYPSM, I'm going to assume that 21,500 are either Asian-American or international (principally Asian), since that number is roughly equivalent to the top 10% of Asian-American high school seniors (somewhat less than that number will apply, and I'm assuming it gets made up by internationals). Let's say roughly 1,500 will ultimately matriculate across HYPSM, and that they'll get 1.25 HYPSM offers each on average (i.e., one in four gets two offers, the rest get one). The other 19,000 are denied. That brings us down to 37,300 applicants for 5,185 remaining offers.

Let's say each school has 50 (for a total of 250) miscellaneous other "institutional priorities" on average (development case, celebrity or celebrity offspring, from the 50th state, faculty brat, child of a foreign government official, very strong in some sport that doesn't get a recruit spot, contrabassoon virtuoso, Broadway performer, published author or other unique talent, etc.) and they get 1.5 offers each on average - now we're at 37,050 applicants for 4,810 remaining offers.

Assume 300 unquestionable geniuses, who get 2 HYPSM offers each on average - we're now down to 36,750 applicants for 4,210 remaining offers.

I'm going to guess most of the desired number of first-gens at each school has been reached via overlap with the athletes, URMs and other institutional priorities groups, but let's assume another 500 across the five schools are admitted (e.g., through QuestBridge) and get 1.2 admits each on average. Now we're at 36,250 applicants for 3,610 remaining offers

At this point, we get to everyone else and individual results become much less predictable - did the rest of your package, i.e., your essays, recommendations, etc., speak to the adcoms in the right way? Did you convince them that you and the school are a perfect match? Some of the best unhooked or weaker-hooked kids may have lightning strike in more than one place, because they have an unusual story. I think 2,600 students or so divide those 3,610 remaining offers; the other 33,650 are denied.

So, let's check the math: 125,000 applicants, less 62,500 denied for being unqualified, less 2,400 denied legacies, less 19,000 denied ORMs/internationals, less 33,650 others denied equals 7,450 HYPSM matriculants - pretty close to the aggregate number of 7,217 posited by @spayurpets in last year's compilation of admissions data.

The numbers also add up to 2,060 cross-admits among the HYPSM schools. Since there are 10 possible two-school cross-admit pairs, this means that there are just over 200 cross-admitted students on average for each two-school pair, which seems in line with the Stanford faculty senate numbers. Bear in mind that each school hands out about 2,000 admits, so the cross-admit percentage is roughly 10% with any other school.

Yes, I know this is a gross oversimplification and people will have differing opinions as to the size and composition of the groups, but I don't think it's a million miles from the truth. One can see how these schools could have processes that are more similar than different, but that the aggregate number of cross-admits could still be pretty small. This is, in my opinion, because large percentages of cross-admits tend to be found in groups that have small numbers (e.g., elite URMs, institutional priorities and unquestionable geniuses, all of whom are rare and highly-prized), while for the larger groups (e.g., ORMs/internationals and the unhooked), chances are that different (albeit possibly overlapping) subsets will be admitted at each of HYPSM because the large numbers make individual admits less predictable.

As a follow-up, I should have clarified two things.

First, it should be clear that I worked backwards from known numbers of matriculated students (e.g., athletes, legacies, Asians) to figure out how HYPSM ended up with those numbers. What I'm *not* saying is that these schools decide, for example, how many Asians they want, make a list of Asian applicants and then pick out names until they get to the quota. Admissions is holistic, and candidates may check multiple boxes (this, for example, is why I believe academically elite URMs, or highly-qualified development-level legacies face significantly better odds than applicants with a single hook). I think there may be some tweaking of the final list of admits before release to keep numbers "balanced", but I think it starts by picking kids that are holistically, and collectively, the best mix for the school's needs.

Second, and related to the above, I'm conscious that I haven't allowed for admits who fit in multiple categories. It would have been too complicated and speculative to try to adjust for that. I don't want to give the impression, though, that I don't believe anyone in my "unquestionable genius" category is URM or ORM, for example (I'm sure plenty are), or that all international admits are either Asian or institutional priorities. The groups are presented without overlap to keep things simple.

Good posts @DeepBlue86, note that Fareed Zarkaria (Time, CNN) did argue there was a de facto Asian quota, maybe not a number but a percentage (like more or less the ivies and Stanford will cap Asians at 20% or so). He argued it was similar to the one Jewish applicants faced when the ivies didn't want to admit them but they had the best academic credentials. But I agree that colleges should be able to choose their class as they see fit.

BTW, how do you define a genius, I thought I knew one, lol, but he got waitlisted at Stanford.

57.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
Personally, I think there is a de facto Asian quota, but I also believe there is a de facto legacy quota and various other de facto quotas, because the number of seats is finite and the universities want to ensure that all the constituencies I listed are well-represented - so some get squeezed.

For me, the geniuses are publishing very impressive work, winning national prizes/contests, etc.

@deepblue86 "I also believe there is a de facto legacy quota"

It seems to me that the benefit of legacy continues to decline every year. Legacy percents are generally declining and at some schools legacy admits have higher stats than the rest of the student body. That suggests to me that the bump for legacy is not very large.

59.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I think the increased recruitment of first-gens has been paralleled by a decrease in legacy enrollment. There are only so many slots, and legacies generally need to be brilliant or connected nowadays. As I've said elsewhere, it's in the interest of the universities for the alumni to think the preference is big enough to be meaningful, and for everyone else to think it's so small as to be irrelevant. As a result, between two-thirds and 80% of legacies (who are generally more qualified than the average applicant) are denied, which still translates to significantly better odds than non-legacy applicants face. That's a topic for other threads, though.
