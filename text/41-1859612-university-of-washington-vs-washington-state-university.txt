Hey guys, I am a high school senior who lives in the state of Washington, and I am planning on going to either UW or WSU (assuming I get accepted into UW this coming march). I have a 3.91 GPA and have taken 7 AP classes. Which ever one I end up going to I plan on majoring in Chemical Engineering.

2.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
If you are not directly admitted to the chemical engineering major at Washington, see <url>https://www.engr.washington.edu/current/admissions/admitstats</url> for information on how competitive it will be to enter the major later.

3.<<<RJDailey98>>>
Thanks for the reply! Just took a look at the link and it has some helpful info that I'll be sure to keep in mind when making my decision. Looks like you need a 3.5 GPA or above if you want any significant chance in getting in.

4.<<<LakeWashington>>>
Yeah, the separate and subsequent engineering school admissions process at UW is a bummer for kids. Sure, a lot of applicants are successful, but even sharp kids get stressed out during the Freshman and Sophomore years worrying about being admitted into UW Engineering.

That said, WSU STEM certainly isn't weak, just not as robust as UW Engineering. Significant companies do recruit WSU engineering alumni. Your career will be fine at WSU.

5.<<<UWfromCA>>>
^ It's a bummer for some kids. Is your 3.91 GPA weighted or unweighted?

6.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@LakeWashington , thanks for the reply! That is reassuring knowing wsu engineering will help me succeed.

@UWfromCA , 3.91 unweighted

7.<<<UWfromCA>>>
@RJDailey98 , that's super. If your test scores are in line with your GPA, you should have a great shot at either freshman direct, early or regular admission to the chemical engineering major at the UW. Good luck!

8.<<<RJDailey98>>>
Thanks! Really appreciate it.

9.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Here is an example of a student who now has to transfer away from UW if s/he wants to continue in his/her desired major, due to not entering as a direct admit and earning only a 3.16 GPA:
<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/engineering-majors/1838242-rejected-from-cheme-at-uw-for-low-gpa-is-my-life-ruined-what-are-my-options-p1.html</url>
<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-majors/1859686-applied-physics-major-at-uw-or-engineering-at-university-of-north-dakota-employability.html</url>

If you enter UW without direct admission to your major, be prepared to manage your GPA like a pre-med until you get admitted to your major and/or prepare transfer applications (perhaps to WSU) in case you are not admitted to your major.

10.<<<UWfromCA>>>
^ A cautionary tale: If you are an international student with a 1590 SAT (730 math) and a 600 SAT 2 in Chemistry, obtaining a chemical engineering degree at UW will be difficult.

If you enter UW without direct admission to your engineering major, be prepared to have to succeed in your classes in order to be admitted to your major.

11.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Of course, "succeed in your classes" is the pre-med definition in this case. I.e. B grades, normally considered successful, are failure for this purpose.

12.<<<UWfromCA>>>
"Of course." "Succeed in your classes" is more like the high school definition in this case.

13.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@ucbalumnus , thanks for the links to the posts, I definitely don't want to get into a situation like them. I'm leaning more towards WSU I think now.

14.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@UWfromCA , I'm a little confused what definition you are getting at, but I am fully aware that in order to get into the chemE department I will have to work my butt off like never before.

15.<<<UWfromCA>>>
@RJDailey98, I was referring to what would be considered succeeding in high school, for example, a 3.5 to 4.0 unweighted GPA.

With your academic ability, in order to get into that department at UW, you would need to keep doing what you have been doing.

16.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@UWfromCA , ah gotcha, thanks for the clarification

17.<<<MYOS1634>>>
With your current GPA and achievements, you should be fine at UW even if you're no a direct admit (although your odds are good).
Washington State's vibe is VERY different from Seattle's and UW's. Have you visited and done at overnight at both ?(attend 2 classes: one in engineering, one a freshman seminar or a small humanities class; eat the food, talk with people, read the campus paper...)

18.<<<RJDailey98>>>
One of my major concerns is that WSU doesn't have a lot to offer besides the school. I'm worried I will get bored because really the only thing in Pullman is the college. Obviously I am going to college to learn, so it shouldn't be that big of an issue, but does anyone have any insight on getting "bored" at college?

19.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
One thing for student facing a high college GPA requirement (to enter the desired major, to renew a necessary-for-affordability scholarship, to have a chance at medical or law school) to consider is whether such a high college GPA requirement will inhibit taking risks with grades in order to explore additional interests. For example, would you consider doing the following:

* Take the most advanced placement possible with AP credit after reviewing the old final exams of courses that can be skipped.
* Choose honors courses or other more in depth versions of courses, even though they may be more difficult to get A grades in.
* Choose interesting breadth and free electives that may be more difficult to get A grades in.
* Take higher course loads in order to fit in more courses of interest into the schedule.

Or would you make the stereotypical grade-grubbing choices:

* Repeat AP credit to try to get easy A grades.
* Choose the least rigorous options to try to get easy A grades.
* Choose breadth and free electives based on the ease of getting A grades.
* Take normal or light course loads to make it easier to get A grades.

20.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@ucbalumnus , thanks for the lists of pros and cons! Really makes things clear. And yeah, that is one thing I have thought about a lot lately. I know at WSU I would take the honors path and get myself involved in as much as possible, like independent research. However, at UW I probably would not take any honors classes. As far as AP science credits go, I have earned a 3 on the AP Chem test and hopefully at the end of this year I will earn at least a 4 on my computer science and calculus AB test. I am having a difficult time deciding whether to use my AP credit in chem, as it is a subject I could use a refresher on, considering my major will most likely be ChemE. I am very confident in my computer science and calculus class, so I do not plan on retaking those in college for an easy grade. Any insight on the issue?

21.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@MYOS1634 ,I appreciate the positive reinforcement! Really makes me less stressed about the whole going to college thing haha. As far as tours go, I did a full campus tour at UW and then spoke to the ChemE department advisor. I really do like the modern and urban feel. For WSU, I have a tour on march 6th, where I will get to take a look at everything on campus. The two vibes really are a lot different, which is what is making my decision so hard. If I could somehow have WSU be new and urban and be located in seattle, then I would for sure go there... I guess it wouldnt really be WSU then haha.

22.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
For AP credit, if your college allows you to skip a course, try the college's old final exam for that course to see if you are ready for the next course in the sequence.

Students in small college towns like Pullman tend to make their own fun. It's a really different vibe from an urban university. The students all live in close proximity - either on campus or in apartments that cater to university students. The town may have a small downtown area that caters primarily to the students. Often, social life thrives on the campus itself - all the parties and social events and interesting things not only student-wise, but in the community, happen on campus. I used to work at a large state university in a small college town (Penn State) and I remember attending all kinds of interesting things on campus I would never have been able to get into when I lived in New York - too many people would've been interested. (Laverne Cox came to speak; Yo-Yo Ma came to play; Broadway shows came to the campus theater; Kevin Hart did a show at the campus stadium, etc.)

It's really up to what you find fun. If the "stereotypical college experience" you see in movies appeals to you - large green, rural campus, kids playing soccer on the quad, parties on campus, insular dorm life - then WSU's social life will probably suit you fine. If you prefer an urban experience in which you and your friends pool your pennies and go out to the newest restaurants, the trendiest cafes, see indie music, visit art museums, go to the symphony - then the urban UW vibe will probably suit you better. (And many students would thrive in either!)

24.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Wsu has more of an outdoors and frat party vibe. Uw is more "urban" in all meanings of the word.
Have you applied to the U 's honors program ? You should... This way, problem solved, you have your dream university :)

25.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@juillet , thank you so much for the long response. I really appreciate you putting in some time to help a naive soon to be college student. You descriptions of the two really made the general vibes a lot more clear to me, and I am beginning to think I would like the more traditional experience at WSU. Thanks again!

@MYOS1634 , Unfortunately you can no longer apply to the UW honors program :( Except I think I would have a difficult time enough at UW keeping my GPA high enough to be accepted into the ChemE program, let alone participate in their honors college too. Thanks for the response! :)

26.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Wait until you get notification from UW and pay close attention to whether it includes direct admission to your major.

27.<<<LakeWashington>>>
"Washington State's vibe is VERY different from Seattle's and UW's."

What an understatement!!! LOL. If you like coffee, you'll be happy at UW. If you love lentils, you'll love the Palouse and WSU; largest lentil growing region in the WORLD!

28.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@ucbalumnus , I agree. I think I've decided that it would be in my best interest to attend WSU if I don't get direct admission to UW.

29.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^ Frankly, with your credentials, you'd be very well positioned to get your major at UW even if by some fluke you're not a direct-admit. :) Don't choose WSU because you're afraid. :) Don't make your choice until after visiting: if you think the environment "fits'" you better at WSU (and it'll be very clear, I think), then you have a terrific option. :)
Keep us updated!

30.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@MYOS1634 , thanks so much for the help, I really do appreciate it. After my visit at WSU, and after I get my letter from UW I will be sure to let you know my decision :)

31.<<<cjacksoh91>>>
Hey RJ,
I am a current junior in electrical engineering at WSU. I really enjoy my time here and I am excited about the subjects in which I am enrolled. Every day is pretty much a new topic that fires me up. I had a pretty solid performance in high school, but college totally caught me off guard. When I was thinking of coming here, I looked into the honors college and I thought that would be the route for me. I'm telling you, the honors college is a bit of a joke. Pursuing a degree in chemical engineering will be plenty prestigious and time consuming enough. I have a small spread of friends across most all engineering programs and I've never heard of any engineering student being in the honors college, but I'm far from omniscient.
I'll tell ya that everyone I knew as a freshman who started out in chemical engineering switched majors. I had three people close to me (one a roommate, another friend, and a third friend) all switch majors after 3 or 4 semesters into the degree. Hope it suits you, I know I would personally be very interested in that topic if it weren't for my passion in electrical engineering.
Good luck, I'm sure you'll be happy no matter where you go. Remember, college is mostly a course in life and less in academics. You'll learn triumph, failure, patience, finances, and more that directly apply to having a successful life.

32.<<<cjacksoh91>>>
I also wanted to state that I've already had one summer internship with a major corporation (can't say who via internet) and I have absolutely no worries about my future career. I feel as I will be FULLY prepared to be a competent professional in my field. I actually think the STEM programs at WSU are great! There's a wide selection (maybe not as large as UW) but we have a very solid set of engineering schools. Come visit the campus, RJ! Sit in on a few classes! Skip sitting in on all the freshman and sophomore classes. Junior classes are where you'll really get to see some content to sink your teeth into.

33.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@cjacksoh91 , thanks so much for the personal reply, one of the most helpful responds I've had. Why do you believe the honors college is a joke? Obviously I have no knowledge on it besides what is on the website, I just figured it would give me some good opportunities to get involved in research, participate in smaller classes, and earn more scholarships + travel abroad.

You say the three friends who started in chemE ended up switching majors, do you know why? I've been seconding guessing that choice as well and would probably choose mechanical/materials engineering instead of chemical, or even electrical. The research I've come across has implied that chemical engineers generally have to move in order to find a job, and are typically limited in career options
(obviously that isn't always the case). That is why I'm considering mechanical engineering. Do you have any insight on the issue?

As far as visits go, I am going to the March 6th tour date that gives you a renewable $1000 scholarship! Hopefully i will get a chance to sit in on a class at that point.

Thanks again for the help, it's awesome to get a perspective from someone who is in the WSU engineering department! I hope I will be as passionate about my career like you one day.

34.<<<cjacksoh91>>>
Mechanical engineering is freaking awesome. I was a personal trainer for 3 years here at the university and I trained a mechanical engineering professor. He was very friendly and encouraging about my coursework and it was very useful to probe his mind about various topics. I basically got a sum-up of the entire thermodynamics course in 10 minutes once haha. As far as studying chemical engineering vs mechanical engineering goes...Chem E is useful if you want to work specifically with petroleum or if you decide to go for med school. Chem E vs microbiology degrees look pretty good comparatively on a med school application (I heard from a guy who got into med school who had a chem e degree). Mechanincal engineering is probably one of the most broad topics you can study. I've taken a few mechanical engineering courses and I liked the subject material. As an ME, you can go into petroleum as well (I've got a friend who works for Exxon in Alaska with an ME degree) as well as other fields.

If it were me, I would start off as an intended ME and after taking chemistry and physics (Freshman/Sophomore years) decide if you'd like to switch to Chem E.

As far as the honor society goes, well, it's my opinion (and the opinion of my classmates -- I asked them on Friday) that being an honor student while in engineering is useless because if your goal is to have small classes then engineering classes = small classes. The only exception to that rule is in the first year or two. Freshman/Sophomore classes tend to have large class sizes. I had a friend who took honors physics and he loved it so perhaps you'd be interested in being in the honor society until you actually take engineering classes.
It's my opinion the only reason to be in the honor society is for the bragging rights. That's probably not true, but it's the overarching opinion of most people here.


Who knows! If you like electronics and video games and electricity and all that jazz perhaps you should consider EE too! I'd highly recommend it since I'm going through the program right now.

35.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Honors College is useful because you get priority registration and thus get to choose the best professors as well as the schedule that works best for you (if, say, you're not an early riser, or if you want Wednesday off for an externship...), plus the Honors Gen eds are small, interactive classes (Honors students get their best grades in Honors classes because that's how they like to learn) taught by the best professors so you get to avoid TAs and adjuncts. Generally ( but you'd have to check at both UW* and WSU) Honors Housing is the best housing freshmen can get (with substance free, sometimes - due to no risk of drunken trashing of the hall.) It's true Honors is most useful during the first two years, when odds are you'll have lots of large, lecture-driven classes, and when being in Honors helps you 'get your foot in the door' for research.

*You can still apply at the beginning of Spring Quarter. They'll use your grades from Fall and Winter quarter to decide whether to admit you.

36.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@cjacksoh91 , thanks again, your reply makes me super excited to get into the engineering classes. My calculus class right now is one of the only classes I look forward to going to everyday, I love learning the new topics. I can't imagine how cool the engineering classes get :)

On the WSU website it says you need 15 honors credits total to graduate with an honors degree. Do you know if it's 15 in social science, arts and humanities, and interdisciplinary sciences together? Or 15 in each separately?

I'm curious about electrical engineering. I'm super into video games and computers. Could you give an example of what an EE would do? And what personally you find so awesome about it? :)

One last question I have is do you recommend using AP credits or retaking the class? For example, I got a 3 on the AP Chem test, and could opt out of the first General Chem class at WSU. However, I feel as though I could use a refresher on the subject and would maybe want to learn it better.

Thanks for the help, I really appreciate it!

37.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@MYOS1634 , I was unaware that you could apply for the spring quarter at UW, thanks for the heads up! Like you said, and cjacksoh91 did, I think the smaller classes would be a great option. The option to get priority registering would also be a bonus. Just out of curiosity, where do/did you go to school? And what is your major if you have one? :)

Thanks!

38.<<<mamaedefamilia>>>
Until you know whether or not you have gotten into UW with your chosen major and until you see whatever financial package UW might offer, I think it's too early to decide. The cost may end up being comparable. If you do get into Chem E at UW, I would go for it! They wouldn't admit you if they didn't think you were capable of the work.

Try not to let fear guide you!

39.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@mamaedefamilia , you're right. I think I have a tendency to listen to the bad experiences and influences about a specific college rather than the good ones. My biggest worry is that at UW the undergraduate have a difficult time because UW is so focused on their graduates and so focused on research the the underclass man don't get an ideal academic experience/ environment. Also I'm a tiny bit worried that the engineering at UW will be super difficult. Obviously that could just be one individuals opinion, and I think I need to try to look past negatives that people portray about UW, considering it such a high caliber and amazing school.

Thanks for the encouragement, if I get direct admission I'll consider it heavily, not letting fear guide me. :)

For WSU, a 3 on AP chemistry can be used for CHEM 105. Try to find a WSU CHEM 105 final exam and see if you know the material on it well.

For UW, a 3 on AP chemistry can be used for CHEM 142. Try to find a UW CHEM 142 final exam and see if you know the material on it well.

41.<<<mamaedefamilia>>>
@RJDailey98 Assuming you get in to UW, I would ask some very specific questions about opportunities for undergraduate research. Is there a grad program in Chem E at UW? How many grads as opposed to undergrads? There may be statistics available about how student performance in the entry level "weed out" courses - how many drop out of given classes or out of the major altogether. Some research on your part will either confirm or alleviate your fears.

Wherever you go, I guarantee if you consistently sit at the front of the lecture hall, even if it has 500 people in it, the professor will get to know your face. Visit office hours and the professor will know your name. If you are proactive, you won't be nameless and faceless and opportunities will flow.

They are both great options - as you investigate further you will have a clearer idea of which place feels better for you!

If you end up at WSU, Pullman is only a 15 minute drive to Moscow, ID, which is a great college town, if you feel like you'd like a change of scenery. If you are into nature, it also has lots of outdoor options.

42.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@ucbalumnus , oh yeah totally forget about that option, I might go ahead and do that this weekend, see how well I do! Do you think that I should give myself any refresher at all before taking one of the finals I find, or just go into it with no review? Haha I'm worried id get almost all the calculations wrong without revisiting the formulas... Guess that might be a hint for me to retake the class :)

43.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@mamaedefamilia , all this advice is awesome, thank you so much :) I am going to go ahead and do that research, I'll report back if I find any useful info. Thanks again.

If you can find more than one final exam for the course, you can try it first without any review, then use the result to tell you what topics you need to review, then try another final exam after doing review of those topics.

45.<<<theaussie>>>
@RJDailey98 I was also accepted to the WSU Honors College, and am intending on being a Chemical Engineering major as well. Like you, I have also applied to UW as a chemical engineering major (that being said, i'm seriously considering pre-med, so ChemE might not be the best fit anyways). In terms of the academics, the campus life, the proximity to Seattle and my parents, UW is a better fit for me personally. So, if it's between UW and WSU, I will pick UW. However, if you know you want to pursue Chemical Engineering for sure than it sounds like WSU would be a great fit! Side note: you have great stats, so you have a great chance at being a direct admit at UW!

46.<<<Magnetron>>>
[quote]I'm telling you, the honors college is a bit of a joke.[/quote]

No, it's not a joke. My oldest son is a junior at WSU and my daughter is a sophomore in the Honors College so I got to see both sides. One of my D's best friends is a chemical engineering major, interned at Hanford after freshman year. Four of my son's five roommates are engineering majors, all seniors. My D also lives in the Honors Dorm - apply for housing today if that is your first choice, it may already be full.

A lot of college involves group projects. In Honors, you know the shared work will be exemplary. In regular classes, some will be good, some will be terrible, some won't be completed. The first English course at WSU is English 101, roughly a repeat of high school English. In Honors, the first is Honors English 298, a hands-on course in conducting and publishing original research. You say you're hoping to do research?

Don't underestimate the importance of early registration. Popular courses fill quickly and kids get closed out of required classes.

At least at WSU, a 3 in AP Chem can be used for general science credits but not for a class required in your major (at least what I was told). Chem is also a huge weedout class.

I know a whole bunch of kids at UW also, including my youngest's best friend, but the information you have there is pretty solid.

Good luck, and let me know if you have any more questions.

47.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^yes, I definitely wouldn't skip a class for which I got a 3 on the AP exam that's also weed out and required for the major.

48.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@theaussie , looks like we have a lot in common! Im glad to see UW is a great choice for you, and appreciate your positive reinforcement. :) Did you happen to take AP Chem in high school?

49.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@Magnetron , thanks for the reply! It is nice to hear your viewpoint considering you have an outside perspective on both sides. I am not sure if you know the answer to this, but can you apply for housing without declaring which school you will be attending? I went to apply for the honors housing, but it seems as though I cant do it without depositing my enrollment fee. Also, is your daughter glad she is part of the honors college? Is the extra work worth it?
Thanks for the help!

50.<<<theaussie>>>
@RJDailey98 I did not-- I've taken AP Biology and am taking AP Physics right now. I did take Honors Chemistry in sophomore year, and initially I signed up to take AP Chem for my senior year. However, over the summer my counselor told me that I should take AP Physics, since I only had half a credit of Physics on my transcript (It's a long story involving an international move. She implied that not having a whole credit of physics would jeopardize my applications to engineering schools). However, I was accepted to a very tech-oriented school, Georgia Tech, so I don't think it effected my application that much. I wish I had taken AP Chem though!

Also, I realized I might have been a bit negative about WSU in my initial comment. That is definitely not the case. The Honors College option within WSU makes it a great option overall. It seems like they have a pretty bustling bioengineering and chemical engineering department. In fact, the WSU counselor I've emailed on-and-off told me that they're some of the most active departments on campus research wise. Those departments attract some really motivated intellectual-types. Plus, the Honors housing looks really good from what I've seen :).

51.<<<Magnetron>>>
[quote]but can you apply for housing without declaring which school you will be attending? I went to apply for the honors housing, but it seems as though I cant do it without depositing my enrollment fee.[/quote]

To apply for housing, you have to submit a $200 housing deposit. If you end up not attending, you will forfeit that $200. For kids who really want their first choice housing, they are willing to risk the money and submit for housing as early as November. My kids did not do this and they were comfortable enough with their freshman dorm experiences.
[quote]Also, is your daughter glad she is part of the honors college? Is the extra work worth it?[/quote]

Yes, she is glad, and most likely would not have attended if she were not part of the Honors College. It's not so much that it is extra work as it is different work. They will assume you have the baseline knowledge already dialed in so the freshman courses will be more similar to junior/senior year courses. Instead of "position" papers you would be writing publishable research papers. Instead of the required "Capstone Project" you will be expected to submit a Senior Thesis. Some honors level kids choose not to be part of the Honors College because they know they can skate through the freshman level classes with minimal effort.

My D doesn't drink and doesn't go to parties even though she is pretty social. Her group of friends is a lot like her even though most are not in the Honors College. Yes, you can find staggering drunks on Tuesday nights, and it does earn that reputation, but it will not define your experience.

52.<<<Pulsatix>>>
I think you have a pretty good shot at direct admission Chem E. I know someone who got in with worse GPA and less AP's.

53.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@theaussie , I dont think your initial comment was negative at all :) It is reassuring to hear that the research you have done on the honors college is all positive.

@Magnetron , im glad to hear your daughter has had such a great experience! If I end up attending WSU I think ill for sure join the honors college. Thanks for the help!

54.<<<RJDailey98>>>
@Pulsatix , thanks! That is awesome to hear, I am anxious to see the results in march. :)
