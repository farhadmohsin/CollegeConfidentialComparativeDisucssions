how does stanford compare to iv league or very high ranked skools? is it up there?

2.<<<run4fun>>>
you need a 2230 for stanford and straight 800's on SAT II's...otherwise they wont let you in.

3.<<<zantedeschia>>>
lol
stanford is definitely "up there" with the ivies.

4.<<<ForeverZero>>>
Stanford's sciences and engineering departments completely dominate the Ivies (it's comparable to MIT). The humanities, although not as strong or well-known as the tech departments, are nothing to scoff at, and they manage to hold their own against the Ivies, which have traditionally been humanities-oriented.

5.<<<staticsoliloquy>>>
okay I predict that this is going to turn into a big argument between Baba and everyone else.

6.<<<ForeverZero>>>
If that happens, I hope this thread closes like the other one he hijacked.

7.<<<datalook>>>
Check almost any dustinction measure of faculty, only Harvard can match against Stanford. No other IVY can, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

8.<<<zephyr151>>>
I agree, Datalook.

Stanford's social sciences are the best in the country outside of Chicago and Harvard.

9.<<<urkidding>>>
You must be joking.

10.<<<urkidding>>>
Chicago is one the best school in the world and the best in the US. Its research is better than Harvard, yale, Priceton, JHU and Penn. In spie of bad location South Chicago it attracts some Noble type faculty. For theoratical research in Finance is as good as Wharton. I would rank Chicago number 1.

I wonder why people compare Tech schools like Stanford to great schools like Chicago. East or west, Chicago is the best.

11.<<<ForeverZero>>>
For social sciences, Stanford is tied for 3rd in Economics, tied for 4th in English, tied for 4th in History, tied for 6th in Sociology, ranked 2nd for Political Science, and ranked 1st for Psychology. Chicago's only really top social science field is Economics.

Your science ranking is completely screwed up. In bio, Stanford's ranked 1, Chicago's tied for 20th. Stanford's med school is ranked 8th, Chicago's 19th. In engineering, Stanford's ranked 2nd right after MIT.

Chicago's a great school, definitely very prestigious in academic circles. But to claim that it's better than Harvard and Stanford and to rank its sciences as such is preposterous.

12.<<<Sam Lee>>>
2 posts so far and they are all found here bashing (with false info) Stanford!

13.<<<ForeverZero>>>
LOL that's what I thought too. But baba never mentioned UChicago before, so I dunno.

14.<<<urkidding>>>
Chicago is famous for its tough academics. Also here in mid west Ivy or Berkeley does not matter. Most kids want to go Chicago or that school in Evanston. Harvard folks come to our schools all the time but Big 10 schools and Chicago has so much to offer that very few kids care about IVY. We
rank Chicago number 1 then NW, then Big 10( Michigan). Some odd student end going to IVY mostly Harvard or Brown. Just call up any good high guidance he would confirm that Chicago is the school.

15.<<<ForeverZero>>>
The language is definitely that of baba. Either he got a new username, or there's a copycat. Although it's weird that he never mentioned Chicago before. I mean, he's going to Penn and he was always so pro-Ivy...

Stanford vs IVY in academic reputation

1) members of National Acadmy of Science
Stanford (125). Harvard (150+), Princeton (70), Yale (60+), all the other IVIES (below 40 each)

2) members of National Academy of Engineering
Stanford (80+), all the Ivies less than 30. Believe or NOT, Stanford > sum of (all Ivies)

3) National medal of science winners
Stanford (30), Harvard (33), Princeton (15), with almost all the other Ivies having less than 10 each (Yale has won 8, Brown and Dartmouth only have 1)

4) top 5 majors in science according to US NEWS:
Stanford (7):
math/applied math/physics/biology/computer/geology/chemistry

Harvard (4)
math/physics/biology/chemistry

Princeton (3)
math/applied math/physics

All the other IVIES: no top 5 majors.

5) top 5 majors in Humanities
Stanford (6 majors): politics/economics/English/psycology/history/socioloy

Overall, better than any IVIES even in humanities by US NEWS geaduate school ranking. No IVY school has more than 4 top 5 humanity majors.

17.<<<urkidding>>>
US News ranking are cooked.

18.<<<urkidding>>>
databook you missing Chicago and Berkeley here. Stanford must not be doing well as against berkeley and Chicago that is why you are ingoring them. Why do you bring IVY in discussion here since they are only for rich kids from Northeast. America heartland is midwest from Ohio to Nebraska. Here in the Red States Bob Jones has more prestige than any of the liberal schools from Coastal areas. Midwest represents true values of America, Now we have Judge Roberts from University Texas going to supreme court. Compare that with first Job sandra O got offered coimg out of Stanford Law school as Office assistant. Never any of the Chicago Law graduate was treated such lowly in any mid west law firms. We have traditions, Values, jesus, Gerald Ford and Milton friedman. What do you have from Coasts: Rob kennedy, Larry Summers, Arnold "touchy" terminator, Jerry Brown and Bill Gates a Stanford reject i guess.

19.<<<datalook>>>
at least the graduate school rankings are based on surveys on academic peers in the same area, definitely much much objective than the random, abitrary ranking from you (urkidding).

20.<<<staticsoliloquy>>>
I had baba kicked out by the administrator. Urkidding, this is your last warning, if you don't provide any substantial fact to your ridiculous post, I will do my best to have you kick out too.

If it is Baba, I must say, this is depressing. Making a new sn so you can continue your immature bashing of the school that rejected you. Move on

"In spie of bad location South Chicago it attracts some Noble type faculty. For theoratical research in Finance is as good as Wharton. I would rank Chicago number 1."

first off, it's the Nobel Prize.

22.<<<staticsoliloquy>>>
granted, UofChicago has won the most Nobel Prize through association or through its faculty. Urkidding, why don't you give us the number of professors elected to be members of National Academy of Science and that of Engineering, as well as National Medal of Science winners for Chicago.

In terms of Nobel Prize won by faculty, Chicago has 15 (4 in physics, 1 in chemistry, and 8 in Economic Sciences). Stanford has 16 (10 in physics, 3 in chemistry, 1 in Medicine, and 2 in Economic Sciences). I would say Stanford is the more well rounded school that excel in all fields.

But you know what, this thread isn't concern with UofChicago. It's Stanford vs the Ivy League.

23.<<<blogged>>>
ok bak to my question. so stanford most agree is on par with ivy leagues rite?

i live in the middle east. the weird thing is quite a few ppl get accepted from here. i mean every great student i ask is going to stanford.

i know a guy who took the SAT I (old) three times and managed to get a 1480 and got into stanford. of-course i know many other factors are involved, but i think his ECs were decent but not GREAT. anyways so i heard stanford places great emphasis on essays.

24.<<<filmxoxo17>>>
stanford is good. ivys are good. get over it, everyone.

25.<<<ForeverZero>>>
Well, if every "great student" is going to Stanford, doesn't that answer your question? And btw, a 1480 is not a bad score. Stanford doesn't place as much emphasis on numbers as some other top schools. They require many essays because they want to accept exceptional people who have admirable personal qualities, not 4.0/1600 robots. It shows, too; Stanford's student body is the most diverse and well-rounded one that I have seen so far.

26.<<<urkidding>>>
I am in process of compiling data for Berkeley and Chicago and will be happy share with you. I have seen some posting on Berkeley CC where it shows to it be superior than IVY. Be back with more precise information.

If you like CA go to Berkeley, Stanford or Cal Tech. If you like east Coast then IVY will do. But they are not peer schools becuase of being regional in nature.

29.<<<ForeverZero>>>
You think that the Ivies aren't like country-clubs? Not all of them are in cities, either.

30.<<<irock1ce>>>
Stanford easily matches up academically to HYP but in reality, the ivies and Stanford are completely opposite from each other in terms of their location, history, style, environment and everything else you can think of.

Of course, there is also another school the bay that is quite similar to Stanford academically: Berkeley.

again...it's nobel. and 2nd, to irockice, i never like you when i first met you at the airport. so i don't have to act like i do now. I defend my school with facts. Opinions are useless if they're not based on something substantial. I could say "oh the sky is green" but it's a stupid opinion isn't it? Right, it is because it's not based on anything. 3rd, mind your own business, as you said, this is a forum, so why don't you "backoff."

34.<<<zephyr151>>>
Urkidding = baba.

Berkeley won 30 Nobel Prizes. SO what? You'll never even catch a glimpse of those professors. You won't even get to be taught by their best TA's.

35.<<<zephyr151>>>
"Of course, there is also another school the bay that is quite similar to Stanford academically: Berkeley."

You have got to be kidding. For the record, there was no contest in my mind, or really anyone's: I was admitted to Stanford, Berkeley and Chicago, and many others. By the time my neurotransmitters realized I was admitted to Stanford, the choice was made. And it wasn't even my early school.

Statics and myself, and others, all have a right to defend our school if we want. A baba clone won't be tolerated.

Fact of the matter is, the best students will vote with their feet. 95% of the time, they will pick Stanford over Berkeley. And about 90% of the time, they will pick Stanford over Chicago.

*whoosh* look! It's the best cross-admits...and they're all at Stanford. How neat.

36.<<<irock1ce>>>
lol ok. for undergrad education, people would certainly pick Stanford over Berkeley. Thre is no doubt about it. However, when it comes down to what we look at to measure the best universities, there is little doubt that Berkeley would measure up to Stanford in most of its departments. Show me the individual departments where Stanford is so much superior to Berkeley. Don't give me U.S. News, because U.S. News is biased against public universities. London Times Higher Education? Shanghai rankings? Gourman? U.S. News DEPARTMENTAL rankings?

"look! It's the best cross-admits... and they're all at Stanford. How neat."

Yup, and also the most elitist and arrogant ones too apparently. Am I being a Baba clone? Nah. I'm not saying that Berkeley or Chicago or wtvr he is **** is better, but I am simply saying that there are also many other great universities out there.

I'm going to Harvard in the fall, and I certainly don't hold Harvard over every single other university. Get over your own university, its great and all, but it isn't the start-all end-all of all universities.

zephyr151, About the following: Of course, there is also another school the bay that is quite similar to Stanford academically: Berkeley."

Clearly Berkeley is a less academically solid school because many cross admits choose to go to Stanford. Oh wait, perhaps your strong academics have let you down- the logic just isnt with you here!

In 1980 Congress expanded this recognition to include the social and behavioral sciences. The Committee of 12 scientists and engineers is appointed by the President to evaluate the nominees for the Award. Since its establishment, the National Medal of Science has been awarded to 409 distinguished scientists and engineers whose careers spanned decades of research and development.

Nobody's disputing Berkeley's prowess at the GRADUATE level. However, its undergrad departments are quite lacking. The undergrad student body is simply too large to accomodate individual students' needs, and all those amazing professors are focused on their own research and grad students to care about the undergrads. No matter how many Nobel winners there are in the faculty, it doesn't matter if they don't even look at the undergrads.

42.<<<irock1ce>>>

Foreverzero, I'm not going to enter the fray on this one because the conversation has been done to death, but I'd like to make a few tiny comments about your posts. First, living in NJ, how do you know what its like to go to school at Cal? You don't, so you really have no authority to speak about what its like. Two, what do you think the famous profs at Harvard or Stanford are doing, teaching intro classes? Ha! YOu act like this is only a Cal issue. If you think that just because a school is PRIVATE you'll actually get to take undergrad classes with the most famous researchers then you're nuts. Ok, thats it. Feel free to bash each other for the next two weeks or so.

Oh well, I don't mean to flame or anything, I just wanted to make the point that Private Uni's, although not completely able to offer the best profs to undergrads, are leaps and bounds better than Public Uni's.

I'm a Harvard admit who chose Stanford. This is for the Class of 2008.

Actually, almost all of my friends who live in the Bay Area are Harvard admits who chose Stanford. My friends from the midwest are split 50-50.

48.<<<ForeverZero>>>
I have a number of cousins and family friends who went to Berkeley for undergrad, and they had nothing positive to say about their experiences. It's not even the fact that classes are taught by TA's. One cousin actually had to stay for a fifth year because she wasn't able to place into certain classes and complete the requirements of her major. The university's simply too large to accomodate the undergrads very well. Berkeley's not a school that I would attend for undergrad. Simple as that. Gentleman may disagree with me, but whatever. We're all entitled to our own opinion. More people choose Stanford over Berkeley, so there must be a reason for that.

49.<<<staticsoliloquy>>>
i agree; CAL at the graduate level is just as good if not better than HYPSM. But undergraduate is so horrible. Go over to the Berkeley forum. Look at all the bureaucratic issues they have to deal with: telebear, incompetent administrations, waitlisting for a core class, schedule conflicts, etc. I for one wouldn't want to be putting up with that.

"Two, what do you think the famous profs at Harvard or Stanford are doing, teaching intro classes? Ha! YOu act like this is only a Cal issue. If you think that just because a school is PRIVATE you'll actually get to take undergrad classes with the most famous researchers then you're nuts."
I know that at MIT there is an intro bio class that everyone has to take and guess who teaches it? Dr. Eric Lander (the guy who headed the Human Genome Project and also Director of Broad Institute) and Dr. Robert Weinberg (Director of the famous MIT Whitehead Institute).

50.<<<DRab>>>
I'm glad we have anecdotal intro classes from a school or two. To be honest, i'm far too lazy to search Berkeley's website to see which famous profs teach intro classes- i just don't care that much. My professor don't have to be famous to teach me everything i need to know, the the bureaucratic issues are more rare than it sounds. Yes, things happen, and the school should help more, but it's not that bad, sorry to disagree. Berkely is above the graduate level of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and MIT, but these guys are pretty close and right behind. Undergraduate is so horrible, yes, so horrible, that no one should go ever. Except that isn't near the case, because it allows many people educations equivalent in many ways to the "elite" privates. Again, sorry to disagree. Do you guys have no scheduling conflicts? Please. To say that this does not exist outside of Berkeley is rediculous. Plenty of administaters are competent, and guess what else, some at your school or the other big playahs are not.

51.<<<entropicgirl>>>
I'm a Harvard admit who picked Stanford. And I'll be taking a class from a Nobel Laureate my freshman year. Plus, even one of my friends who got a *Regents Scholarship* to Cal is already planning on having to take 5 years to graduate, and ALL of my friends who are going there are incredibly stressed out about class sign-ups (they've been going through the process for months now). One of them is taking a class taught by a fellow undergraduate because everything else she was interested in with the right number of units is filling up.

Not that I'm bashing Cal; I definitely believe there's a need for excellent and affordable public universities, and a good 3 or 4 of the best people I've ever known are going to be there next year. I'm just saying that yeah, according to people I know, it does have its issues, and you can't ignore that.

52.<<<DRab>>>
I agree, it has its issues.

About you being a Harvard admit who picked Stanford, you're a rare exception. Both are great schools, of course,with very different feels and other things . . . haha yeah.

Your friend who is planning on graduating in five years is an exception as well, who is probalby planning on studying abroad for half a year, doing the UCDC program, and double majoring, or some time consuming similar combination. It is possible to graduate in three years, and it is possible to study abroad and graduate in four. The class sign up process is melodramatic because of the "phase" aspect. It has its problems, yes.

The DeCal classes, courses taugh by undergraduates, are fantastic. As a student, it gives one the opportunity to teach a class or take a weird, odd class about some subject most universities woud never offer, such as studying Radiohead, Atheism, or many other common or uncommong areas.

[quote]About you being a Harvard admit who picked Stanford, you're a rare exception.[/quote]

I am sorry but that's not "a rare exception". What is rare exception is Stanford admit picking Berkeley (assuming money isn't an issue). ;)

<url>http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxx/2000.11.16/features/front.html</url> talks about the 3-way rivalry in terms of not only recruiting faculty but also UNDERGRAD STUDENTS.

54.<<<irock1ce>>>
sam - well that was from the year 2000..... and although Stanford did make considerable gains, its acceptance rate is still higher than Harvard/Yale/Princeton..... And yield rate wise, Harvard still trumps on Yale and Stanford (cross-admits... its domination).

55.<<<DRab>>>
Well, they are equally rare.

56.<<<urkidding>>>
So I see most admits for Harvard are from CA going to Stanford. So it is regional School. It is that simple. I know from one Stanford survey 1/3 Stanford admits are Berkeley Rejects.

57.<<<Sam Lee>>>
irock1ce,

First of all, the acceptance rate is only couple percentage points higher than HYP's. You don't need to make it sound like it's a big difference. Just because Harvard wins more cross-admits doesn't mean that it's "rare" that Harvard admits pick Stanford. If it were that "rare", there wouldn't be any rivalry to speak of. Even if 4 out of 5 (I highly doubt it's that many) cross-admits pick Harvard, calling it "rare" is still an overstatement.

DRab,

<url>http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2004/october6/decline-106.html</url>
[quote]no more than 1 percent indicated that they would attend a Pac-10 school[/quote]

No more than 1% cross-admits picked Berkeley over Stanford. "Equally rare"? Are you sure that no more than 1% Harvard-Stanford cross-admits picked Stanford? Apparently, you are just making it up.

<url>http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/news/1994_Sep_28.STANFORD.html</url>.

In 1994, 4 out of 5 cross-admits picked Harvard over Stanford when the yield was way lower (54%) than recent years'. It's reasonable to believe that's the worst Stanford got. Even at its worst, we are still talking about 20% vs 1%! I've seen quite many Berkeley fans throwing out bugus claims just to make Berkeley look better. BE PROUD OF YOUR SCHOOL! You guys don't need to fabricate things. Do people value integrity at Berkeley??? One statement I saw couple weeks ago on Berkeley's board was like this: "the average SAT of Koreans at Berkeley is higher than average of SAT of princeton admits". LOL! You guys are just amazing. What's up with this Asian pride (lie) thing going on?

urkidding,
Since less than 1% of cross-admit picked Berkeley over Stanford; it means if you do a similar survey on Berkeley's campus, virtually everyone that applied to Stanford is Stanford reject. It's good to look from both angles. ;)

58.<<<ForeverZero>>>
Urkidding/baba: please don't bring the regional issue back. We've been through it over and over: every school has an element of regionality in enrollment. Period. You will not find one school that has a uniform distribution of students. And also, don't mention that survey because it is not very credible. It was conducted online with minimal (if any) security, so Berkeley students and other pranksters very well may have tampered with it. It's more unreliable than the Princeton Review college rankings. Seriously, why are you bringing your old flawed arguments back? Is getting banned once not enough?

59.<<<Sam Lee>>>
Speaking of Berkeley's "issues", I just thought of this one: Berkeley is the second most difficult school to get in among the Pac-10s, but it's football (or basketball also?) athletes have the second (or third? Maybe you can look it up, ForeverZero. I read that from Stanford's bootleg.com) lowest average SAT score!!! Berkeley isn't known to care if its students can graduate or not; when it comes to athletes, all they care is if they can bring them wins which lead to more MONEY. Remember the scandal couple/few years ago about these athletes getting A for a class they didn't even show up much?? You know why it was A but not B or C (which would make it a lot less obvious)? I suspect it's because because they did so bad in other classes that they needed A to pull their overall GPA high enough so they would be still eligible to play and stay in Berkeley! Of course, Berkeley had said they fixed the problem. To me, the only way to prevent this sort of things happening again is to stop admitting athletes that are likely to fail. Seriously, if Berkeley is so difficult in grading/classes, how in the world they expect people with SAT score barely above NCAA's eligibility to survive without some sort of cheating/compromise (like super easy classes tailored to athletes?)?? I suspect this sort of things still go on over there.

60.<<<GentlemanandScholar>>>
Hmm, I bet stanford's athletes are just as good as the rest of the imcoming class, right? I'd love to see what the SAT and GPA's of the defensive line and the starting 5 on the B-Ball team are. I'm sure they're steller. Maybe it says more about stanfords grading that athletes are able to sail through what is supposed to be a "top" university.

61.<<<ForeverZero>>>
This alludes to the classic argument of recruited athlete admissions. This topic's been argued to death. Yes, there are many recruited athletes at both schools, which heavily emphasize sports. Yes, some of them are not as well qualified academically. However, it's very stereotypical to assume that all recruited athletes are failing students; being a jock and a nerd are not mutually exclusive. Who knows? Maybe Stanford's b-ball team is as qualified as the rest of the class.

62.<<<Sam Lee>>>
GentlemanScholar,
Thanks for your concern. Stanford BB team's graduation rate is actually higher than that of the entire student body. In the 90s, the graduation rate was 100% when nobody was drafted early before graduation. The average SAT of Stanford's athletes are usually #1, #2, or possibly #3 among division I programs (excluding Ivies because they don't provide their stats), depending on which year (other two schools are Rice and Northwestern) we are looking at. Go look at bios of the athletes on Stanford's athletics' page and they definitely look pretty good students to me. The Collegiate Woman Athlete of the Year this year, Ogonna Nnamani, was a valedictorian as well as student body president in her HS. She just graduated and was a premed and a chemistry/biology major.

The academic compromise at Stanford is nowhere near the level of Berkeley.

63.<<<Sam Lee>>>
ForeverZero,

It's nice to see Chris Hernandez return for his senior year instead of being drafted. Stanford team needs him. :)

[quote]For the Class of 2008, the university admitted 2,486 students; 1,665 accepted the offer of admission and arrived at the university last month. Of the 821 students who declined admission and filled out a form that indicated where they were going instead[/quote]

And that's the problem with your survey.

Also, 55% to 61.4% . . . that's pretty similar, not too much "way lower."

Many, many kids chose not to waste their time and money on the Stanford app for many reasons, and yes, many of them would not have gotten in, but they are not Stanford rejects, much to your chagrin.

65.<<<Sam Lee>>>
DRab,

It would be very nice if you stop presenting false information, if not outright lying. 1665/2486 = 67.0%, NOT 61.4%! The yield of 1994 was 54%, not 55%. Geez!

Your last point is, well, pointless. I specificly referred "those who applied to Stanford". Read my post carefully.

By the way, what about 20% vs 1%??? Funny how you conveniently avoid that.

66.<<<DRab>>>
Sorry, I just searched the web for the number. I wouldn't post something i thought was false. Those extra 5.6% points help you sleep at night, don't they?

My point about the survey being ridiculous is very valid, and was echoed by foreverzero.

Perhaps, by looking at the cross admit statistics for Harvard and Stanford (where stanford gets its ass kicked, just as Berkeley does with Stanford) you will realize that cross-admits show only so much.

20% vs. 1%- I am on it. Here, this is me acknowledging it. Does that make you feel warm and cuddly inside? Good, I hope so. Now, realize that these numbers might be way off, either in favor of your argument or against it. Satisfied?

DRab,

When you get into a debate, concentrate on facts and numbers and the subject being discussed. You should appreciate others presenting arguments with REAL numbers instead of accusing them being annal. It's not about that extra 5.6%. It's about 67% not being similar to 54%. You seem to be rather confused.

ForeverZero was commenting on a different survey. The one I put out was done by the Stanford's admission office.

68.<<<DRab>>>
Thanks for the lesson. Your superior academics really show. No, i'm kidding, i agree with you, and i apologized for stating the incorrect fact which i thought at the time was correct. My numbers are just as real as yours, I'm not accusing you of being annal. I did imply that the difference was not significant, but yes, of course there was a difference. Thanks for your concern about my confusion, i'm quite fine. Yours are accurate, mine were for a past year, a mere typo, please relax and realize that i wasn't attemption to lie about various Stanford university numbers.

69.<<<rooster08>>>
I highly doubt Stanford gets its ass kicked by Harvard. Does anyone has the numbers?

70.<<<ForeverZero>>>
Sadly, every school gets its ass kicked by Harvard. Its yield is almost 80%, which is way higher than any other college. I'm sure that more cross-admits choose Harvard over Stanford. The real issue is how Stanford stacks up against other competitors, like Yale, Princeton, and MIT. According to a Yale article, it does better against the big H than Yale does. Also, the Revealed Preference ranking shows that for overall cross-admits, it comes in 3rd nationally (after HY).

71.<<<urkidding>>>
Yield 2005
Harvard 78%
yale 71%
Priceton 67.6%
Upenn 66%
Columbia 58%
Brown 59%
Cornell 50%

Stanford is around 60% since it has not published the data so far, must be low this year.

Stanford get about 10% of the class from Northeast with highest from NJ 2.5%, that is about 160 kids. Wonder how many of these northeast kid were IVY cross admits. Assuming all these 160 also applied to IVY then IVY overlap with Stanford only 10% of the class. That is why Stanford is not a peer school for IVYs.

Stanford competes with UC, Cal TECH for more than 50% of the class( west coast CA 41%, WA 4% ......). So these are the peer schools for Stanford, not IVYs. It is so silly that Stanford does not breakout regional data in detail( something hide I guess) like all IVYs do. Rhen Stanford publishes cross admit data and losses to IVYs to create a peer relationship. It loses most cross admits to IVY but it usese as marketing game by admitting bunch of ACademic Index 9 TYPE kids from Northcoast.It loses most of them. Since Stanford has high yield in West which help it balances its low yield in east.

72.<<<ForeverZero>>>
Urkidding/baba, we've been through this over and over. Do you really want to get banned again?

Stanford's admit data is not published until the fall. The yield is usually around 2/3, which would be 67%. Considering they took less than 10 kids from the waitlist this year, the yield is likely higher. Also, where did you get that nonsense data about 2.5% from NJ?

Static already warned you. Now I'm warning you. Post one more thing about this stupid topic and I will do everything in my power to get you banned...again.

[quote]Hmm, I bet stanford's athletes are just as good as the rest of the imcoming class, right? I'd love to see what the SAT and GPA's of the defensive line and the starting 5 on the B-Ball team are. I'm sure they're steller. Maybe it says more about stanfords grading that athletes are able to sail through what is supposed to be a "top" university.[/quote]

Well, considering the academic qualifications of Berkeley's football and men's basketball players, I don't know that I'd be taking the position you took. You know what they say about those who live in glass houses. A fair comparison is to look at the SAT and GPA's of Stanford's basketball team relative to that of Cal's team. Or Stanford's football team relative to that of Cal's football team. Come on, man, you know Cal, so you should be well aware that Cal athletes like Jason Kidd weren't exactly tearing it up in the classroom.

77.<<<GentlemanandScholar>>>
Sakky, why in the world, if talking about athletes' scores compared to the rest of the student body, would you want to compare them to a different school's athletes? That makes no sense. Lets compare Cal's basketball players with the players at the University of Alabama. I bet Cal's team has better scores, but what does that prove? I wasn't trying to say anything about Cal's athletes, what I was saying that in general the athletes at top schools will have lower scores than the rest of the student body. I know you're just acheing to bash Cal for anything and everything, but your comment is just irrelevant.

Well, that is this year's version, but of course he forgot to mention that a few of those schools are tied (it doesn't help Stanford that tied schools are listed in alphabetical order). In actuality, it is:

How is that a bash at Cal? You said it yourself - scholarship athletes at all schools are invariably worse than the average student at that school. Stanford is no better than the average school in this regard, but also no worse.

You say that you were making a general point about athletes? So why did you say Stanford by name? It seems to me that you're always itching for an excuse to bash Stanford. And yet you accuse me of always looking to bash Cal? If it's fair for you to point out Stanford by name for its lowered athletic selectivity, then it's fair for me to point out Cal by name for doing the same thing.

I do not know why people from west like to grt involve with IVY league.
Stanford belongs tro Pacific 10 league. Its peer schools are
Cal, UCLA, USC, UWA, WSU, UAZ,UOR, OSU and Stanford.


IVY League: HAR, PENN, Princeton,Columbia, Cornell,brown and Dmouth.

I hope this clear now. Repeat after me: Stanford is a PAC10 school.

85.<<<rooster08>>>
hi again baba

86.<<<astaticsoliloquy>>>
lol oh this is hilarious...

I agree with you. Stanford is a PAC10 school. They belong in the PAC10 league which by far dominates the ivy league in respect to sports. And how can Stanford be its own peer school?

The universities with most distinguished faculty
<hr>

The Top 4 giants are Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and Berkeley. Based on the number of current faculty members in each university who have been selected to the national academies, these 4 universites dominately have the most distinguished faculty members.

The national academies consist of The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and Institute of Medicine (IOM).

The National Academy of Sciences, National Academy of Engineering, and Institute of Medicine are private, non-profit institutions that provide science, technology, and health policy advice under a congressional charter. New members are elected by current members of each institution.

Election to membership in the National Academy of Sciences is considered one of the highest honors that can be accorded a U.S. scientist or engineer. Academy membership recognizes those who have made distinguished and continuing achievements in original research.

Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional distinctions accorded an engineer. Academy membership honors those who have made "important contributions to engineering theory and practice, including significant contributions to the literature of engineering theory and practice," and those who have demonstrated "unusual accomplishment in the pioneering of new and developing fields of technology."

Election to the Institute of Medicine is one of the most distinguished achievements accorded to those in fields related to medicine and health, reflecting both an honor and obligation to work on behalf of the organization, its governance, and its studies. With their election, members make a commitment to devote a significant amount of volunteer time on a broad range of activities on health policy issues.

The universities with most members in national academies listed below:
================================================== ===

#1 Harvard (271 members in total, 157 in NAS, 15 in NAE, 99 in IOM)
#2 Stanford (260 members in total, 126 in NAS, 85 in NAE, 49 in IOM)
#3 MIT (236 members in total, 102 in NAS, 108 in NAE, 26 in IOM)
#4 Berkeley (209 members in total, 128 in NAS, 73 in NAE, 8 in IOM)

#5 University of California at San Diego
(107 members in total, 66 in NAS, 16 in NAE, 25 in IOM)
#6 Caltech (100 members in total, 67 in NAS, 30 in NAE, 3 in IOM)
#6 Yale (100 members in total, 64 in NAS, 5 in NAE, 31 in IOM)
#8 Princeton( 97 members in total, 70 in NAS, 20 in NAE, 7 in IOM)
#9 Columbia ( 92 members in total, 38 in NAS, 17 in NAE, 37 in IOM)

Other universities :

Cornell ( 62 members in total, 39 in NAS, 21 in NAE, 2 in IOM)

stanford is not an IVY League institution, please do not compare this. They nelong to PAC 10 leagur with Arizona, Oregon and WA,

94.<<<iv4me>>>
Stanford athletes are held to a higher standard when compared to other scholarship-offering universities (this does not include ivies). For example, for football, while the minimum SAT score for NCAA athletes is below 1000 (old SAT), Stanford's minimum SAT score is about 1200. Also, Stanford is the only D-1 A football school in the country that still requires its recruits to fill out an application. Stanford also does not take any CC or JC transfers.

95.<<<GentlemanandScholar>>>
iv4me, I think its probably safe to assume that Stanford's athletes are stronger academically then many of it peer (sports) schools, but what I disagree with is the way Sam Lee made it sound as if the athletes are on the same level as the rest of the student body, which is not the case. Even if athletes--and when I say athlete I mean the major sports--have 1200 SATs, (which is good for a bigtime football or Basketball player) they would still be at the very bottom wrung of SAT scores in comparison to the rest of the school. And what you said about athletes having to fill out apps is a crock. Yeah, maybe technically they still fill out apps, but do you really think they're thrown into the pile with the rest of the non-athlete apps? Would having a 3.5 gpa and 1200 SATs get you into Stanford if you couldn't throw a ball 70 yards?

96.<<<astaticsoliloquy>>>
Of course with stats like that, you're not going to get in, but not everyone can throw a ball 70 yards.

I start college in a few years and I want to become a psychiatrist I know that involves a medical degree then a specialization but I was wondering what school would be best for what I want to do.
My grades are really good and getting into schools really isn't a problem for me. I have done some research and I am thinking about applying to:
Columbia
Brown
Harvard
Stanford
Cornell
University of Chicago
The distance between the schools really isn't a problem because I will probably be living in a dorm no matter where I go
I want to know which out of these schools is the best for what I want to do and if there are any other schools you could recommend for what I want to do.
Thanks
