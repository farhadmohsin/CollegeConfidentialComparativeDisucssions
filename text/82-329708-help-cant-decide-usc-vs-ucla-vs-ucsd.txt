Okay, I've narrowed down my search to these 3 schools. I'm a chemistry major, but thinking about changing it to maybe biochem or neuroscience, and possibly minoring in history. I also really want to do study abroad, possibly in Scandinavia/England/Scotland/Ireland/France (?)/Italy. I love them all; I just can't decide!

2.<<<CATennisPlayer>>>
bump!! anyone?!!!

3.<<<phobos>>>
you're the first person that i've seen in a while that had the same exact choice in schools that i did...i've seen lots of USC vs. UCLA or USC vs. UCSD, but not all at once, and this was the decision that i agonized over, so much so that i didn't sent in my decision until the Sunday that they were due!

i chose USC. i'm in engineering, so each school was essentially on the same level. people can bicker over marginal differences in this ranking or that, but the difference really was negligible. what appealed to me was the fact that USC students, unlike those that i saw at UCLA or UCSD, were overwhelmingly well rounded people...compared to engineering students (arguably the most "niche" student type) at the UCs, USC students were much more outgoing and interested in doing things other than staying in their dorms. this was also really reflective of how you described that neuroscientist. every professor i've encountered and taken classes with, and especially for me in engineering, was surprisingly amicable, kind, and as expected, brilliant.

as far as minoring, again quite in stark contrast to the UCs, USC actively promotes the pursuit of a minor. as an example, the Renaissance Scholar program awards numerous grad school scholarships to students who excelled in two disparate fields of study, whether by minor or double major. even as an EE, i plan on minoring in music recording.

and perhaps one important thing that i'm almost sure the UCs don't have is mandatory student advisement for your entire undergrad career. before you're allowed to register for classes for the coming semester, you have to meet with your school (and later departmental) adviser to work out which classes you should take. as a freshman registering for classes, my meetings were often 15 or more minutes (which is more than enough), and they only get more in depth as you go along. at least in engineering, walk-in advising is usually available every week...actually, just this week i used walk-in advising times to get my adviser to give me a scholarship recommendation.

and add to the academic attention and rigor you get at USC, the student life is amazing. if you want, there are opportunities for it to be exciting (by going to parties, clubs, other kinds of soirees), and if you don't want to it's always easy enough to find people who just want to relax.

4.<<<CATennisPlayer>>>
wow! Thanks for the advice, phobos! I know the Honors program at UCLA does include advising, though not mandatory, but I felt that USC seems so much more personal and caring about developing my interests. I'm really looking into minoring in some really different field of study from my natural science major (whatever that may end up being). Can anyone tell me the benefits of the UCs and why their programs are supposedly so good?

5.<<<CATennisPlayer>>>
bumpy bump

6.<<<confusedlost07>>>
UCSD has a lot of medical companies all around san diego which is really good for internships if u want to go into biochem.

7.<<<CATennisPlayer>>>
can anyone attest to the strength (or lack of) in the science depts at UCLA/UCSD/USC? I really want to know if and why the UCs are surrposedly so strong in the sciences and USC supposedly is not so much. I would greatly appreciate it if someone can uphold or reject this claim. This is probably the major concern for me right now. I want a strong academic program in the natural sciences.

8.<<<QW553>>>
UCs have a long history of investment and emphasis in science research. UCLA is all around good science school, while UCSD gains its major fame from bio-sciences, which benefit from the closeness to Scripps and Salk. However, these shouldn't have huge impact on your undergraduate study, because most of resources there are for graduate program and faculty research.

USC science is catching up quickly by investing in its LAS and promoting academic research excellence. IMO, the average quality of faculty at 3 schools are roughly the same, which means you will get taught and exposed to the similar level of materials. Considering the personal attention and research opportunities for undergrads, USC can be quite attractive to some science students. Most of BAC/MD students enroll at LAS and they are all Ivy caliber students. Every year many students from LAS get placed into top graduate schools for their Ph.Ds. I don't think you need to worry about education quality at USC, at least compared with UCLA/UCSD. If you are driven, motivated about what you want to do, you will succeed at any school.

If you still consider changing majors, USC can give you great flexibility.

I am the one always saying the science departments are the weakness of USC. This is true mainly due to the stark contrast with its professional schools, which are mostly top 10 ~ 20 in the country. Part of the reason LAS are lower ranked than UCLA/UCSD is the small size of faculty at each of its department. And this probably won't change any time soon. It may take another 10~20 years, but I definitely see great potential here.

9.<<<UCLAri>>>
Congrats on getting into all three!

Don't let the music blaring really get to you. I mean, after all, people do like to have fun once in a while! After you get past your intro courses, there are tons of opportunities to take small, personal classes at UCLA. Both USC and UCLA actually are fairly similar in their class sizes to an extent, but I suppose you got to see how big a UCLA class can get! Don't worry, most aren't that way.

For study abroad, UCs are a <i>superb</i> choice. This is one thing that I think that UCs have over most privates! EAP (Education Abroad Program) is awesomely great! It offers you the chance to study almost anywhere at the same price that you'd pay to go to a UC! Not only that, you get full support from the UC and your home university.

Don't let my ebullient post fool you into believing that I have a negative opinion of USC. I don't. I just am not a USC alum, so I can't offer you a valid opinion. I'll let the Trojans do their best (worst? :p)

Good luck!

10.<<<jbusc>>>
Since you got into the honors programs at both USC and UCLA, you'll get a world class education wherever you go.

UCSD is particularly strong in bio/biochem/biomed engineering, due to the very large bio industry in SD, but I wouldn't think it was quite the caliber of UCLA/USC in most other respects.

11.<<<ucchris>>>
"UCSD is particularly strong in bio/biochem/biomed engineering, due to the very large bio industry in SD, but I wouldn't think it was quite the caliber of UCLA/USC in most other respects."

USC is no where near as well rounded across the entire academic sprecturm as UCLA. I actually feel USC is the least well rounded institution of these three. Its departmental strenghts are in the professional and arts fields, such as Film, Communications, Business, and also Engineering. It severely lacks solid departments in the sciences. It also lacks well ranked departments in the social sciences. UCSD on the other hand is very strong departments are in the sciences and some social sciences. These include Neurosciences, Biology (pre-med), Engineering, Political Science, and Econ. UCSD lacks high ranking departments in the humanities area. Neither of these two universities is strong across near as large an area as UCLA. And I am talking about departments, not sub areas of specific departments. Anyone can find random breakdowns in specific fields that USC or UCSD is good in. Im talking about departments. And UCLA has stronger departments across a much broader field than UCSD or USC. Period. I find it funny how the poster from USC above tried to lump USC with UCLA and say it was stronger across the board than UCSD. Hillarious. That is a ridiculous statement. USC is very very good at its strengths, but is lacking across the board. Saying it is better than USC is most other aspects is simply not true. And lumping it with UCLA in that matter is funny. UCSD is the same way as USC in the sense that it is very very good in its strong departments that its known for, but is not nearly as strong across the board as UCLA. I know this is something that both UCSD and USC are working on the become more well rounded universities, but neither is nearly as strong across the academic spectrum as UCLA. Im not saying neither has their random strong department in an broad area of study that they are not supposed to be strong in. But across the board UCLA is much stronger across a larger spectrum. Period. I dont know how someone could lump USC with UCLA in that regard and act like its education is somehow more "world class" than UCSD's across the board. Hillarious. USC is the least well rounded university across the whole academic spectrum out of these three.

"I'm a chemistry major, but thinking about changing it to maybe biochem or neuroscience"

If this guy is thinking about majoring in Chem and possibly changing it to Bio Chem or Neuroscience, how on earth could anyone tell him in good faith to be choosing USC over UCLA or UCSD. Come on. Neuroscience at UCSD is i believe the number one ranked program in the country and UCLA is also somewhat strong in this area. Chem and Bio Chem are also ranked much higher at UCLA/UCSD than at USC. USC is lower ranked than UCSD/UCLA in all of these areas the poster is interested in. I understand USC has its benefits, such as smaller classes. And this should be noted. But lets be realistic about these schools.

12.<<<CATennisPlayer>>>
Thanx for all your help! I was wondering, when ranking a specific school in a department, what are the criteria they are grading it with? What really makes the neuroscience department strong at UCSD? Thanks!

13.<<<UCLAri>>>
I'm going to have to somewhat depart from ucchris on this.

It's not the ranking of the department that matters. Most rankings are based on research and placement of grads. That's a somewhat meaningless metric to the average undergrad, who just wants to learn the basics. Look at how much better LACs are, on a per capita basis, at placing their undergrads in top grad programs. It sure isn't because of their great research! It's because their teaching is generally excellent.

14.<<<NextMikeSays>>>
Personally, I would go to UCLA. If you have in-state tuition, and the fact that you will have a great college experience there is unbeatable. UCSD has a slight edge academically, but with everything considered I would go to UCLA.

15.<<<QW553>>>
Tennisplayer,

The department ranking is mainly based on the research productivity, and graduate placement (did UCLAri say the same think?). It has little (not nothing) to do with undergraduate educational quality. This is what I know as a graduate student. UCSD's neuroscience is one of the top 5 in the nation because it gets so many researchers working in that area, not just from UCSD, but Scripps and Salk. However its PhD graduates can not compete with Harvard, Berkeley, Stanford and UCSF etc. And that's saying something. The great fame of UCSD bio-sciences came from a bunch of Nobel laureates during last 2~3 decades. But if you look into it, you will find they are all from their Medical school, Salk institute, Scripps etc, except for one or two from their departments. And those great faculty will not teach even graduate students.


Chris,

"Well-rounded university", that is a novel concept. I guess most of huge public schools are more well-rounded than small elite privates. How does that make sense to high school seniors choosing a college?


Mike,

"UCSD has a slight edge academically". That is something really great you discovered. Even UCSD people won't agree with it:)

16.<<<jbusc>>>
While UCSD holds the edge in bio, UCLA and USC honors programs are going to be overall "superior" to UCSD offerings (as best that word can apply to subjective criteria). That is all.

17.<<<NextMikeSays>>>
My point that UCSD has the edge academically was with REGARDS to the OP choice of majors. UCSD is a TOP 3 in neuroscience and has the edge on UCLA/USC in terms of life sciences fields. Yes, this also takes into consideration the proximity of the salk, scripps, burnham, etc because it ALLOWS students there to get top research experience from leaders in the field. When it comes to top graduate schools, it's a small field and people know who the top people in their fields are. An excellent letter of recommendation from a top PI who knows you well and can atest to your abilities holds disproportionate weight in getting you into top programs. At the end of the day, it all comes down to you but the opportunities are greater at UCSD.

18.<<<NextMikeSays>>>
[quote]While UCSD holds the edge in bio, UCLA and USC honors programs are going to be overall "superior" to UCSD offerings (as best that word can apply to subjective criteria). That is all.[/quote]

With regards to honors programs, the main advantage is the smaller size of the courses being capped and being with more ambitious students in general. I wouldn't say superior would be the word I use to describe it, but different, more LAC like in teaching with the reduced # of students.

19.<<<ucchris>>>
Where are you getting off putting USC with UCLA academically, especially in the sciences. Are you kidding? Do some research. USC is not academically on par with UCLA, especially in the sciences. Stop listing it with UCLA. I just find it funny that USC people are trying to explain why attending USC is somehow a good choice over UCSD is neuroscience. The very idea of this, honors or not, is just incorrect. And saying that a USC honors program is going to offer a 'superior' education is very subjective. Maybe superior in the sense of its easier to get good grades. Not in an educational sense, especially not in neuroscience. Describing something because it has smaller classes as 'superior' is not just subjective but also in my opinion ignorant, especially in the sciences. You also stated that USC would be better than UCSD is most others areas other than sciences. That is far from the truth. You are implying USC is more well rounded across a broader academic spectrum (by stating it is better is most other areas). Then i refute that and you state that UCSD only has better academic programs across a broader academic spectrum because it is a large public school. If you agree, then why were you stating before that USC is better in most other areas. That cannot be backed up by fact because it is false. USC is not exactly highly regarded academically, especially not in the sciences. And not even close to UCLA in terms of academics. So stop listing it with UCLA. If you love USC, great. But be realistic in your assesment of it, especially academically and in the science or neuroscience areas of study.

20.<<<UCLAri>>>
ucchris,

Is it really important for undergrads to be taught by superior academics? After all, one could argue (quite well, I'd say) that Brown, Dartmouth, and tons of LACs would provide a superior education despite their lack of research credential.

21.<<<jbusc>>>
Go back and read my post, I didn't even compare USC and UCLA at all - I was comparing USC or UCLA vs UCSD, and even then I conceded that UCSD has the edge in bio. I was comparing the overall programs, not limited to the sciences.

I also put "superior" in quotes because it's all subjective anyway. Maybe superior is a bad word to use, but I still think USC with thematic option honors+FSH etc is still an overall great education in most respects...

22.<<<ucchris>>>
"Maybe superior is a bad word to use, but I still think USC with thematic option honors+FSH etc is still an overall great education in most respects..."

I do not disagree with the fact that USC offers a great overall education. I couldnt agree more. Small classes, good faculty, etc. But a 'superior' one is where i had problems.

23.<<<ucchris>>>
"Is it really important for undergrads to be taught by superior academics? After all, one could argue (quite well, I'd say) that Brown, Dartmouth, and tons of LACs would provide a superior education despite their lack of research credential."

While USC is not Dartmouth nor Brown, nor Williams, nor Pomona, I do not feel academics necessarily make the best teachers, especially in humanities or social sciences. However in science, where cutting edge research and student opportunities often paralell the academics of the department or area, i would argue that the choice of neurosciences being located in La Jolla, where research companies are abundant, and with a top rated department located at UCSD, the choice is clear. Academically speaking this is. If you are looking at going to football games, joining a frat and getting an overall college experience, USC might then become the better choice. But deffiantly not academically in the neurosciences.

24.<<<papercuts>>>
sorry to interrupt someone else's thread but, between UCSD and USC, which school has a higher rate of students moving on to med schools? I'm majoring in bioE premed if I go to UCSD, and biology if I go to USC. UCSD seems stronger in the aspects of science but does that mean it would also be more competitive? I know that in order to go to med school the GPA matters a lot, and as much as I want good education I'm wondering where it would be relatively 'easier' to earn a higher GPA

25.<<<UCLAri>>>
papercuts,

Most of those statistics are poorly collected and usually not very telling when universities are so similar in terms of academic quality. I wouldn't worry about that as much as I'd worry about fit.

ucchris,

How many "average" undergrads are going to even get to touch cutting edge research? How many of them will even get to step foot in the top research organizations? Most people couldn't care less what Salk is doing at any particular moment, and who can blame them? Undergrads aren't cutting edge scientists. They're undergrads. They don't need groundbreaking research. They need someone to explain to them how things work at the rudimentary level. This is why LACs are so great, and why even in the hard and biological sciences, kick research universities' butts in terms of PhD program placement.

26.<<<ucchris>>>
uclari,
first of all USC is not a liberal arts university, so im not sure why we are even arguing this. Secondly, i never stated anything about large research schools being better than liberal arts schools in placement. i stated that UCSD was better in terms of academics in neurosciences than USC and also that UCSD's location offered more opportunities for neuroscience majors than does USC. if you disagree that is fine. but you would be mistaken and i believe this to be common knowledge within academia. thirdly, i personally know plenty of undergraduates at UCSD who do work in labs. hence the benefit of being located in an area such as la jolla. im not sure why you think few undergrads in the sciences at UCSD touch any sort of research as it is readily available if an individual chooses to pursue it, and i know lots of individuals who do choose to pursue it, both while in college and after graduation prior to grad school. fourthly, im not sure why you targeted me and stated in your email that the deffinition of a good education differers. i couldnt agree more. however you target me, when another poster clearly stated that USC offered a 'superior' education. then when i refute that and saythe deffinition of a good education is subjective, you target me. interesting.

"They're undergrads. They don't need groundbreaking research. They need someone to explain to them how things work at the rudimentary level."

I feel you are severely discounting undergraduates intelligence and intellect. Many upper-division neuroscience majors at top schools likely do not need things explained to them at the rudimentary level. While deffiantly not professional researchers, I think they do thirst for top level research. And an environment that can add to this is beneficial. Although if you dont feel so, we are all entitled to are own opinions. Im tired of you targeting me in this post. if you disagree with my opinions so be it. but if you state that a good education is subjective, try not to target those of us who agree with that, and target those who actually state one schools education is 'superior' to anothers.

27.<<<jbusc>>>
Which UC school do you go to?

Look, I never said USC offered a superior or even comparable education to UCLA in any area. I never said that UCSD wasn't the strongest of the 3 in bio-related fields (I said precisely the opposite). I never even said that USC in general was better in anyway than UCSD - all I said was, basically, UCLA and USC general ed honors are among the top in the nation, and that was their strength over schools like UCSD.

So if you thought I said any of the above, then clearly you read wrong. And the reason you're being targeted is because you attacked the <i>subjective</i> opinion of another poster first.

And I might point out that none of this debate actually helps the OP, so we should get back on topic.

28.<<<UCLAri>>>
ucchris,

USC isn't a LAC, that's true. But then again, neither are Dartmouth and Brown.

I'm not saying that there isn't great opportunity at UCSD, nor am I saying that undergrads don't do research. I never said that. What I said is that most undergrads are never going to touch the best stuff. That's left to grad students and PhDs.

I'm not denying that UCSD is excellent. Hell, I'm here right now. What I'm saying is that research is not always the best thing for an undergrad-- even those in the sciences. USC may not offer the labs that UCSD or UCLA offer, but it may offer more students an opportunity to actually get into <i>a</i> lab.

29.<<<ucchris>>>
I went to UCSD for my undergraduate studies.

"Look, I never said USC offered a superior or even comparable education to UCLA in any area."

No, you said it offered a superior education to UCSD. Here is your quote exactly:

"USC honors programs are going to be overall "superior" to UCSD offerings".

I then argued that this was incorrect.

You then stated that you had never stated USC was in general any better than UCSD. Although here is your quote implying that it was better in most other areas outside of sciences:

"I wouldn't think it (UCSD) was quite the caliber of UCLA/USC in most other respects."

So yes, that is exactly what you were stating.

"And I might point out that none of this debate actually helps the OP, so we should get back on topic."

I couldnt agree more. if i could get uclari to stop attacking me on random points which have nothing to do with this post, then we could move on.

30.<<<UCLAri>>>
ucchris,

I think that jbusc put the superior in quotes and qualified its use pretty clearly. He also made the point that it was the honors programs that were the important issue, and not necessarily the major itself.

31.<<<ucchris>>>
uclari, that is correct. he put superior in quotes and then stated that was the only way he knew how to describe it. that is exactly my point.

32.<<<UCLAri>>>
I'm not sure that I get what your point is, then. He said:
[quote]While UCSD holds the edge in bio, UCLA and USC honors programs are going to be overall "superior" to UCSD offerings (as best that word can apply to subjective criteria). That is all.[/quote]

He's not saying that it's the God-given truth. It's a subjective issue with an opinion based on some pretty subjective issues.

33.<<<ucchris>>>
no, before that remark, he stated:
"I wouldn't think it (UCSD) was quite the caliber of UCLA/USC in most other respects."
This is not the god given truth and I rebuked this by argueing that USC is not superior in most other areas. Hence he lumped USC and UCLA together and stated USC was stronger than UCSD is most areas. I dont believe this to be the case. Im still wondering why you failed to comment on that. i would prefer to move on with his post if you would stop targeting my posts and changing the subject to liberal arts colleges and their grad school placement.

34.<<<UCLAri>>>
Selective quotations are not always helpful...
[quote]UCSD is particularly strong in bio/biochem/biomed engineering, due to the very large bio industry in SD, but I wouldn't think it was quite the caliber of UCLA/USC in most other respects.[/quote]

This is not really that bad, and I don't think he really presents it as being 100% true. I didn't comment on it because it was wishy-washy and didn't seem to me to be presented as being a strong argument either way.

Besides, I do in some ways think that USC and UCLA offer better overall undergrad experiences, so there may be some bias creeping in.

35.<<<jbusc>>>
but my personal opinion(what I *think*) is somewhat different from what might be more generally accepted, even if both are subjective. I'm sorry if I didn't articulate that completely, but I maintain what I said before.

36.<<<ucchris>>>
selective quotes, come on. i did not mis-represent what he stated at all.

"This is not really that bad, and I don't think he really presents it as being 100% true. I didn't comment on it because it was wishy-washy and didn't seem to me to be presented as being a strong argument either way."

Seems pretty clear to me. Yet when i state something along the lines how their are more opportunities at UCSD in and around La Jolla for neuroscienes, you take issue with it.

"Besides, I do in some ways think that USC and UCLA offer better overall undergrad experiences, so there may be some bias creeping in."

We (jbusc and I) were talking about academics at this point in the posts, not undergraduate experiences. if you feel he was talking primarily about undergraduate experiences, not academics, read the prior posts again. The only time I or he mentioned the undergraduate experience was when i stated if you were looking at a more well rounded experience such as going to football games and joining a frat, then USC would likely be the better choice. Here was my quote:

"If you are looking at going to football games, joining a frat and getting an overall college experience, USC might then become the better choice."

Im not mad at at you jbusc and hopefully you are not mad at me. we are all entitled to are opinions and of course they are going to differ at times. its all good. i just am not amused by being targeted by uclari.

37.<<<nauidiver>>>
"USC is not exactly highly regarded academically, especially not in the sciences. And not even close to UCLA in terms of academics."

What did you base this comment on? Is this your opinion? I'm not a fan of the US news rankings, but USC is ahead of UCSD overall and I believe is at a level close to UCLA on the peer assessment ranking. I'll at least take that over your unsubstantiated opinion.

38.<<<dhl3>>>
Talking about ranking in this situation is stupid. Sure, USC is one or two places higher than UCLA/UCSD with the engineering dept, UCSD ranks one or two places higher than USC/UCLA for the life science dept, and UCLA may rank one or two places higher than UCSD/USC for the overall "well-roundedness", but are these small marginal differences really that big of a deal to put so much impact into one person's decision for choosing which school out of these three to attend?

All three schools are excellent schools. Just because you attend a school that ranks lower than the other schools doesnt mean you are not going to learn as much materials. The critical thing is the personal preference. It takes more than department rankings to finalize one's decision. It seems the the OP loved USC more than the other two for various reasons. Each school has their own style, strength and weaknesses, and it's up to the OP himself to do the evaluation on each schools to come up with the decision.

All these "USC ranks higher than UCLA" type of crap arguments holds very little value in this matter.

39.<<<cpthk>>>
I am very sure that saying academic USC is no match to UCSD/UCLA. my girlfriend is student in USC, I am student in UCSD, we major the same. But her courses are way easier than mine, even she admits that. Many USC students are rich students, they just pay to get in. They are not as strong in academic as UCSD/UCLA students. Also, USC does not have that many students, so it's not as competitive as UCSD/UCLA. But speaking education, sometimes smaller class could get more help from instructor.

40.<<<joeyshmowy>>>
I had to make a UCLA vs Cal vs USC choice in premed. I decided on USC. Here's why: first I = a premed measure--so in reality it doesn't really matter where you go to school at (as a matter of fact if your planning on grad schools it doesn't matter either). USC has smaller class sizes (by a lot) and you know people walking by the campus. At UCLA you are lost in a HUGE institution. Berkeley was intimidatingly smart anti-social crowd. My friend got into Cals Engineering program (currently has a 4.0) and wants to transfer to USC.
USC has a better class profile (don't quote on exact percentage): 30% asian 40% white, 15% hispanic---UCLA is like 44 % Asian 39% white-- Also at USC you get a lot more students from out of state and out of country with a variety of life experiences (your roomate also may be Governor of Cal's daughter so connections are awesome).
With smaller student classes and more access to professors / faculty one can do much better in class in regards to grades--more resources to do better ( + my buddy at UCLA--who hates USC because thats what all UCLA students do, haha jk (kinda)-- says that people in your class will tear up your notes and still your books to help the curve (thats unheard of at USC, if anything people help you out)
Oh yeah and 2 finish it off, Last year USC was ranked has having the #2 hottest student body out of all colleges-- So if your into REALLY hot girls, go to USC

In the end it doesnt matter where you go, go where you feel like you fit in more, explore all campuses and see which one gives you the best vibe. Thats what i did and i HATED USC b/c both my brothers went to UCLA--i gave USC a chance and shocked my family in my decision

+ UC's are so damn impersonal when you ask for help--USC was VERY helpful in all aspects of applying and orientation-- they still are very helpfull (and don't by the BS about the campus area being unsafe--if perhaps Californias hottest girls (and guys too--not gay but it is an attractive campus) can walk around in mini skirts @ 2-3am in the morning back home and feel safe doing it, its safe. We have like 100 DPS officers + a security guard on EVERY corner and its ALL USC students in like a 5 mile square block radius outside of the school.

Hope this helped

what the hell are you saying Erin's Dad? His post actually helped me out to choose between UCLA and USC. I am a biochem major and I got accepted into both.

also there is less shady people at USC as opposed to UCLA

i don't think UCLA's great representation at top med schools has anything to do with the caliber of students or quality of education received. i think it has more to do with the fact that UCLA simply has many more students aspiring to become doctors.

This line of thinking is flawed. Why wouldn't more talented students aspire for better degrees? Also, the gap between representation in the universities is so significant that I don't think any amount of "career-oriented mentality" could explain the difference. The fact that this extends not only to top med schools but law schools and business schools as well points to the fact that UCLA as a school in general does things better.

Does what better? I'm not trying to answer the question as you frame me to be doing. I'm not asserting that UCLA necessarily provides a better education or has better students. Perhaps UCLA is more "prestigious" and the adcoms arbitrarily prefer its students? Perhaps UCLA bribes top schools? Who knows or cares?

However, the ends is more important than the means and the fact that UCLA students are more successful professional school candidates cannot be brushed aside.
