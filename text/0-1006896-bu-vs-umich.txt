In our continuing search for (hopeful) safeties, can someone compare Boston University and U of Michigan? Academically and socially? Input appreciated. Thanks.

2.<<<IvyPBear>>>
Academics: about the same.

Social life: BU students have access to Boston. UMich students have opportunities to participate in a wide range of campus clubs and activities, but the closest big city is Detroit, which is not comparable to Boston to say the least. Ann Arbor itself does have vitality though, but it can't compare to Boston either.

3.<<<bclintonk>>>
Academics: Michigan is one of the world's greatest universities, with strength in almost every discipline imaginable. BU is clearly a step or two down from that level---no one would ever mention it among the world's greats. It does have some strong programs, but they're spotty.

Social life: BU has no real campus and not much campus life, but some people prefer to go to college in a big city, and as big cities go Boston is an interesting and lively one. Ann Arbor is one of the all-time great college towns. It's a matter of personal preference.

4.<<<Alexandre>>>
Academically, Michigan is slightly better than Boston University. Regardless of what rating/ranking you look at, Michigan will typically be ranked slightly above BU. The difference is not glaring, but it is worth noting. Of course, it all depends on your intended major. For example, BU is excellent in Biomedical Engineering and Communications.

Socially, you cannot compare the two. BU has a non-descript campus with relatively understated social/extra curricular activity. Michigan's campus, on the other hand, is very spirited and active. As far as the cities go, I am not sure I understand what IvyPBear is trying to say. Boston is not exactly a bastion of culture. It does not have an extraordinary art, entertainment or music scene, nor is it known for having major outdoors offerings. It is a pretty typical city, no different than say Denver, Philadelphia or Seattle. Ann Arbor is a mid-sized city and is very much centered around the university, making it a pretty typical college town.

Note that for OOS applicants, Michigan is seldom a safety, especially if you complete you application past the November 1 EA deadline.

5.<<<kobudnik>>>
My sister decided between these two last May and ultimately went with Mich. She's going into communications, and while enticed by BU's great program and internship opportunities, decided that Michigan's world recognition and alumni network along with school spirit was more "right" for her.

6.<<<cobrat>>>
Wow! Either BU has really ramped up its academics or there is some serious exaggeration going on. 15+ years ago, equating BU as on par with UMich for academics...or even one or two levels below would have prompted a serious ROTFLOL. Heck, even had a few teachers/college guidance counselors criticize BU as a place providing an average to mediocre state university education at an Ivy-league price.

Especially when from the high school I went to, anyone with a C-/C average and mediocre SATs(we're talking 1000s/1600 pre-1995) were able to get in whereas even B/B+ students with 1300s tended to struggle to gain admission to UMich.

Moreover, for employment opportunities from places that hire only from Ivy league/Ivy-level universities and colleges like.....UMich is usually included in the recruiting process....not schools like BU.

7.<<<warblersrule>>>

Judging by past posts, the areas of interest are classics and/or linguistics. They're pretty much comparable at the undergraduate level.


I personally prefer Boston to Ann Arbor, but I think a lively campus scene (i.e. Michigan) should not be underestimated. Why not apply to both? It's rarely a good idea to apply to only one safety anyway.

8.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
<i>In our continuing search for (hopeful) safeties, can someone compare Boston University and U of Michigan? Academically and socially? Input appreciated. Thanks. </i>


without knowing your child's stats and home state, it's really impossible for us to know whether UMich or BU are safeties for your kid. And, can you afford those schools. A school isn't a safety if you're not sure how costs will be covered.

Are you in-state for UMich?

9.<<<informative>>>
"Academics: about the same."

What? You are talking about the University of Michigan, right? Not Michigan State? There is no comparison between the University of Michigan and BU. UM is substantially better and much harder to get into than BU. These two schools are not really comparable.

UM is academically superior.
UM is a big state school with a beautiful campus in the suburbs. BU is a big private school in a large city with an urban campus (think NYU).
UM has a great athletics program. BU has a good hockey program, but lacks other programs.

You know I rarely disagree with you Alexandre, but I have to take issue with you on this one. Michigan isn't "slightly" better than BU academically. Michigan has better faculty, better students, and a better academic reputation in almost any discipline you can imagine. It's just not that close between these two schools. Here are a few points of comparison.

US News overall rank: Michigan 29, BU 56
US News Peer Assessment score (rating by peer institutions): Michigan 4.4. BU 3.4
US News ranking, Undergrad Business: Michigan 4 (4.4 rating), BU 42 (3.2 rating)
US News ranking, Undergrad Engineering: Michigan 7 (4.3 rating), BU 56 (2.9 rating)
US News ranking, Best Undergrad Teaching: Michigan 8, BU not ranked (not in top 12)

NRC 2010 grad program ranking, Classics: R-Ranking, Michigan 6-19, BU not ranked; S-Ranking, Michigan 5-16, BU not ranked. Michigan ranked 7th highest of all programs nationally.

NRC 2010 grad program ranking, Linguistics: R-Ranking, Michigan 11-32, BU 21-48; S-Ranking, Michigan 11-23, BU 29-48. Michigan ranks about 11th or 12th nationally, BU rather further down, probably around 30 though I haven't done the calculations.

Philosophical Gourmet ranking of philosophy programs: Michigan 5, BU 48

THES ranking, Worlds Best Universities: Michigan 15, BU 64
Shanghai Jiao Tong Academic Ranking of World Universities: Michigan 22, BU 77

Average HS GPA of entering freshmen: Michigan 3.8, BU 3.5

% of freshmen scoring 600+ SAT M: Michigan 89%*, BU 77%
% of freshmen scoring 30+ ACT: Michigan 46%, BU 27%
* Michigan doesn't superscore SAT, BU does. With superscoring Michigan's figures would be higher.

Average freshman retention rate: Michigan 96.0%, BU 91.0%
6-year graduation rate: Michigan 89.0%, BU 81.0%

BU is preferred by people who prefer a city to campus/college town life, and by some Northeasterners who prefer not to leave the Northeast. Especially for undergrads in business, engineering, or liberal arts honors, Michigan is clearly a superior choice academically. The difference may be slightly less clear-cut for non-honors liberal arts majors, especially those in popular majors. But I would argue that even for non-honors liberal arts students in smallish majors like Classics or Linguistics, the academic opportunities at Michigan will simply be much greater, except in the rare academic disciplines (and I haven't yet identified any) where BU has a stronger program.

11.<<<bclintonk>>>
[quote]informative wrote: You are talking about the University of Michigan, right? Not Michigan State?[/quote]

That's actually an interesting comparison. I'd say BU and Michigan State have a pretty similar profile in terms of how their faculties stack up, with lots and lots of programs in the #30 to #60 range, but far fewer in the top 10 or top 25 where almost all of Michigan's are. But BU's students are decidedly better than Michigan State's. Of all the Big Ten schools, BU's students are probably most similar to Ohio State's in terms of class rank and SAT/ACT scores--better than Michigan State, but nowhere near on a par with Michigan. But then again, Ohio State has a lot more top 25 departments than BU. So I'd say from a Big Ten perspective, BU has Michigan State's faculty and Ohio State's students---on both counts, well shy of Michigan's level.

For undergraduate work, I disagree about classics and in fact anything ancient-related. Linguistics is not my field, however, so you may be correct about that.

Academics -- Both have pretty good faculty, with some superstars and some not-quite-famous-yets; Michigan tends to have more of the former than the latter. Greek and Latin are offered every year at both universities, and enough undergraduate courses are offered that a student could easily take 10-12 interesting major courses. Michigan does offer several more language courses each semester, but that is only useful once one gets to the advanced level (i.e. 3 years or more of a language).

Museums -- BU has extremely close ties with the Museum of Fine Arts. The Sackler museum is also in the Boston area, as is the lesser known but equally important Semitic museum. The Kelsey is a decent teaching museum, but it's just not in the same league; Michigan's collections have always played second fiddle to the earlier and more comprehensive collections at Penn, the Met, the MFA, and a couple others, partly because it was not a serious player in classical archaeology until the late 1970s. Michigan does, however, have a very nice papyrology collection.

Journals -- BU plays host to ASOR as well as some of the major journals in the field (e.g. the American Journal of Archaeology and to a much lesser extent Arion). It's also host to a couple dozen research associates and their projects as a result. Michigan is host to no major journals in the field.

Lectures -- Lectures in classics and related topics are available at BU as well as other local schools with decent to strong classics programs (Harvard, Tufts, Brandeis). Lectures are also available through the MFA and the AIA chapter. Lectures at Michigan are limited to the university itself and the local AIA chapter.

Related offerings -- Both offer courses on Egypt, Mesopotamia, Turkey, and the like. Both offer Hittite, Akkadian, Sumerian, and a couple other ancient languages. Neither is the best for those areas, but they're more than adequate for an undergrad.


Now, a good classics program is great. The new NRC rankings support my long held belief that the programs at Duke and UNC mop the floor with most other programs, so I've experienced the benefits first hand. I'll be the first to admit, however, that a student in Boston/NYC/Philly has an enormous advantage over peers in other locations.

13.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
^^^Wonderful. Someone from Duke, which has nothing to do with thread, has to tell everyone his/her program is superior to the two schools that are mentioned here. The point that bclintonk was making is that overall Michigan is academically superior to BU.

I know this might come a shock to you IvyPBear, but public schools outside of the northeast can sometimes be very good.

[quote]rjkofnovi wrote: Wonderful. Someone from Duke, which has nothing to do with thread, has to tell everyone his/her program is superior to the two schools that are mentioned here.[/quote]
Oh, hush. I didn't make that claim, partly because I'm not sure it's true and partly because I really don't see what the point of such a statement would be.

I brought it up because while I haven't had the privilege of studying at Michigan, I've studied in a similar department in a similarly sized city -- and although I'm very fond of my alma mater, I would be hesitant to say that it has a lot more opportunities than BU for precisely the reasons I outlined above. Some of my friends and colleagues studied classics and archaeology at Columbia and BU, and being in a major urban location gave them a lot more opportunities than I had available.

Is it surprising that location can be a factor? Take Georgetown, whose political science program gets major attention almost entirely due to its location. You could also say the same for studying marine biology in Florida, film in LA, urban studies in NYC, or any number of other fields.

Unfortunately, this thread is getting somewhat off track, perhaps due to my detours. Apologies to the OP if classics is no longer a major area of interest. ;)

UCB,

You'll be happy to know that I think Berkeley was robbed in those lists, as I would put it #1 in the country in the field. I think UT Austin and UCLA also have strong grounds for complaint.

Alas, my opinion does not count for much! ;)


Oh, and to get back to the original topic -- It would also help to know whether your son is a NMF. Boston U makes scholarships available for such students, and Michigan may as well.

You are right. I confused BU with BC this time. If you are comparing BC and UMich, undergrad at either places would be about the same, with neither being superior to the other. However, UMich overall is a few steps above BU.

24.<<<bclintonk>>>
I lived in Boston for two years. I'm inclined to agree with Alexandre. I liked it OK, but IMO it's widely overrated as a city. The art museums are OK but a bit stuffy and not exactly world-class (though Bostonians almost universally think they are). Theater, not much; it's no New York or London, of course, but it's not even close to Chicago, and to be honest Minneapolis-St. Paul has it beat hands-down. No real indigenous jazz or blues scene; other local music, well, places like Seattle, Minneapolis (again) and Detroit blow it out of the water. Good seafood, though, and it has a certain liveliness, it's compact so you can get places (though traffic can be a nightmare), many neighborhoods are relatively safe. Better than Detroit? Sure, but on the other hand when I was in Ann Arbor I more often went to Chicago, about a 3 1/2-4 hour trip.
[quote]warblersrule86 wrote: The Kelsey is a decent teaching museum, but it's just not in the same league; Michigan's collections have always played second fiddle to the earlier and more comprehensive collections at Penn, the Met, the MFA, and a couple others[/quote]

Are you aware that the Kelsey just recently added a brand new exhibition wing that allows it to display 4 times as much of its collection, consisting of approximately 100,000 objects mostly from ancient Greece and Rome, Egypt, and the Near East? Not my field so I can't speak to the quality of the stuff.

25.<<<Alexandre>>>
"That is one of the single funniest thing I've ever read on CC; certainly it's in the top 5."

Vinceh, Boston would not make my top 5 cities in the US for culture, art, music, cuisine etc... Cities like Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, Los Angeles (which I don't like), DC would certainly trump Boston. Hell, for music and art, I would probably pick Detroit over Boston, although downtown Detroit is not nearly as pleasant as downtown Boston. My point is, Boston is a very nice large city, but it is by no means special.

26.<<<vinceh>>>
I have lived in half the cities you've named. Detroit does not belong in the same paragraph as any of them. The music scene in Detroit is decades dead save for Eminem, an accomplishment of questionable distinction. Detroit is incapable of keeping the doors open to it's Symphony and Ann Arbor has a better theater scene. Detroit barely functions as a city, to compare it to any of the cities listed, including Boston, is farcical.

27.<<<bclintonk>>>
^ LOL. I've lived in 6 of the 7 cities Alexandre named, all except LA. I, too, would put Detroit last. I'd put Boston 6th of the 7. But I actually kind of like Detroit, which is gamely making a bit of a comeback. Latest census figures show its white population is actually growing for the first time in four or five decades as empty-nesters and young professionals are moving downtown to be closer to a thriving entertainment, restaurant, and sports scene. Watch out, Boston!

Why would young professionals want to move to downtown Detroit? So they can witness the Detroit Lions go 0-16, see the Detroit Symphony Orchestra musicians go on strike and themselves get mugged/carjacked? Sounds like a wonderful city to live in.

Boston is an iconic masterpiece of a city. Its a living, breathing mosaic of the United States with its winding Charles River, historic Freedom Trail, elegant Old North Church, sumptuous seafood cuisine and distinct ethnic neighborhoods.

Interesting enough, Boston has been through many of the trials and tribulations that Detroit has but has come out on top while the Motor City has faded into oblivion. Read some articles by Harvard Economist Glaeser if you don't believe me.

29.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
BU is in Boston and U-M is in Ann Arbor. How Detroit gets into this conversation of which school is better to attend is beyond me.

30.<<<cobrat>>>
"You are right. I confused BU with BC this time. If you are comparing BC and UMich, undergrad at either places would be about the same, with neither being superior to the other. However, UMich overall is a few steps above BU. "

Even if you included BC, implying their undergrad academics are equal or even one step below would still prompt much ROTFLOL back when I was in high school in the early '90s.

Only similarity here is that that both were about as difficult to get into...though a large part of that was the fact there were many BC Eagles fans applying for their football team in the NE and it was a respectable school after Harvard, Tufts, Brandeis, etc. There are also certain departments which may be stronger (i.e. Religious studies focused on Catholicism)...but not across the board.

Moreover, when corporations who recruit exclusively from the Ivy/Ivy-level schools...UMich is always included whereas BC would never be included. Moreover, with the exception of certain fields, the UMich name also tends to carry more weight in academic and some professional grad school admissions. Frankly, with the exception of a few departments...they're not in the same league.

This is simply not true. They're considered peer schools and cross-enroll a similar quality student. The world clearly has changed a lot since "your days".

"This is simply not true. They're considered peer schools and cross-enroll a similar quality student. The world clearly has changed a lot since "your days". "

Not denying that they enrolled a similar quality student even if we're talking out-of-state for UMich as they were both equally difficult to get into "back in my time".

Only difference is the perception of the quality of the school's education among employers who prefer hiring from the Ivy/Ivy-type schools. For instance, I know of several topflight consulting firms which only recruit Ivy/Ivy-type graduates who always did on-campus recruiting at UMich....but not BU, BC, or even NYU.

As for grad school admissions, both schools have strong records though from chatting with faculty at various Ivy/Ivy-type grad/professional schools, the UMich name still seems to carry a bit more weight than BC. That, however, is not to deny the fact that BC undergrad education is well-respected. Just a matter of degree.

This is so completely inaccurate that it is beyond funny.

Art: Boston has the MFA and the Gardner, and you should throw in the museums at Harvard, since Boston/Cambridge are essentially the same city as far as students are concerned.

Music: Boston has the Boston Symphony, which is world-class. It also has one of the leading scenes in early music. It has two of the nation's major music conservatories, as well as the Berklee School of Music, which is jazz oriented. And of course there is the rock/club scene. All of these groups and institutions throw off an enormous amount of musical activity in numerous genres.

Theater, I would agree, is not Boston's strength.

In addition, Boston has a rich history, excellent restaurants, and a high concentration of highly educated individuals that leads to a vibrant intellectual atmosphere. There are several hundred thousand college students in the greater Boston area. I would say that Boston/Cambridge is perhaps the #1 college town in the US. The idea that it doesn't stack up to much compared to Ann Arbor or Detroit is laughable.

I agree that U Mich is significantly superior to BU.

There is no place more parochial than Boston (i.e., the "Hub of the Universe"). New Yorkers find that laughable.

Real estate prices are irrelevant. Boston is surrounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and on the other 3 sides by densely built 300 old towns (including beauties like Revere, Lynn, Brockton, etc.). Land is at a premium. Other than the Main Line, the suburbs of Philadelphia aren't as dense, there is no natural limitation and real estate is more available.

Recruiting presence doesn't indicate quality. For instance, I know of several topflight consulting firms which only recruit Ivy/Ivy-type graduates who always did on-campus recruiting at some Ivies (+Stanford, Northwestern, UVa)....but not UMich, Stern, or even other Ivies. Doesn't mean the Ivies that receive recruiters from those companies are perceived to be of higher quality than UMich, Stern, or other Ivies.

Monday night is the worst day in the week for restaurants in many cities. It is not usual to have them closed on that day. However, I find it highly unusual that you could not find a restaurant open in downtown A2 even on a Mon. night. Now if you were looking only near the North Campus where engineering is located, I could see your point.

Those are just a small sample of restaurants I can think of, but there are many more...and I am not including the dozens of small fast food/pizza joints that open until late at night.

Now I fully admit that for those of us with a more sophisticated palate, Ann Arbor does not offer much in the culinary arts. But then again, neither does Boston. I sampled several of Boston's supposed culinary spots (Clio, L'Espalier, Rialto, Radius etc...) and I must say I was not impressed. But to suggest that Ann Arbor does not have dining options at 8:30 PM is simply not accurate.

"Of all the Big Ten schools, BU's students are probably most similar to Ohio State's in terms of class rank and SAT/ACT scores--better than Michigan State, but nowhere near on a par with Michigan. But then again, Ohio State has a lot more top 25 departments than BU. So I'd say from a Big Ten perspective, BU has Michigan State's faculty and Ohio State's students---on both counts, well shy of Michigan's level."

Ageed.

Well.. if we are talking strictly 'academics,' Michigan vs BC imho is equivalent to tOSU vs BU at the undergrad level - overall, slightly better. However, at graduate level, tOSU would blow both BC &amp; BU out of the water. In fact, I believe Ohio State's annual research expenditure is equivalent to BC + BU.

Granted, Boston has Chinatown, Little Italy as well as various ethinicity neighborhood and fine dinnings at downtown area, they are not located on or around Common Wealth Ave. (besides the '88' Chinese supermarket down the block), most BU students would have to either take the 'T' or Taxi for true authentic dinning experience. Whereas Ann Arbor - the quintessential college down has everything within the walking distance.

*My favorite Japanese Restaurant in Ann Arbor - Miki
(I know the owner --> best California Roll in Michigan imho)

*My favorite Chinese Restaurant in Ann Arbor

Great Lake Chinese Seafood Restaurant 

(Known for authentic Hong Kong style dim sum (lunch hour) and chinese side-dishes during the night Karaoke hours on wkends).

The above two are the landmark Asian Restaurants in Ann Arbor, period.

P.S. In all fairness, I would not say that Beantown does not have its share of culture and theatres when compared to AA, check out its theatre district around Tremont St, where Wang and many other theatres are located. It is certainly a culturally vibrant city imho. Unfortuately, the notorious 'Big Dig' really put me off trying to navigate around the city when I was there...lol

This is pointless. The title of the thread is BU vs. UMich, not BU vs. the London School of Economics, The University of Tokyo or the Sorbonne. The OP is trying to decide between Ann Arbor and Boston, not the rest of the country or the rest of the world. To the Detroit defenders/apologists, if you want to move to downtown Detroit, be my guest, you'll find a lifetime supply of abandoned buildings and vacant lots to choose from. As for the apparently sub-par food in Boston, Detroit may actually be the better choice for a college student budget, at least in Detroit they'll be able to find an endless supply of that affordable pinnacle of Motown cuisine, the Coney Dog.

51.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
^^^The only people who brought up Detroit are the one's who are trying to compare Boston to Detroit, and not Ann Arbor. They are totally different cities and 40 miles apart. What does Detroit have to do with feedling college students in Ann Arbor? Your point was pointless.

Surprised this thread is still going. UM is significantly better than BU. There really is no debate. Not sure what happened with this thread.

54.<<<lesdiablesbleus>>>
This thread reeks of insecurity on both sides and has become rather pointless. There's a lot more to do in Boston than there is in Ann Arbor though. Also, Boston has some incredible restaurants so I'm not sure where Alexandre has been dining to state that he was "not impressed" with the culinary options in Beantown. If we're talking seafood, then Boston is leaps and bounds above any other city in the US in my opinion.

55.<<<Aniger>>>
I am the op, and this thread has really taken on a life of its own! I got the point though, that academically UMich is significantly stronger. We may keep BU as a safety though in any case as we do like Boston alot (sue me!) but it appears the academic difference is too great to ignore in this comparison. If anyone is still awake on this thread, thoughts on BU vs. McGill? My son is definitely in at McGill as it is purely stats based admissions. Montreal and BOston are both great (but cold) cities inmho, but does anyone have a feel for relative academics? thanks.

56.<<<informative>>>
McGill is one of the best universities in Canada. BU isn't even one of the best universities in Boston.

57.<<<cobrat>>>
As with UMich, McGill is considered on par with the Ivies by employers and grad school admissions officers.

BU on the other hand had been well-known among locals as an expensive rich kid's safety school for those rejected from Harvard, Tufts, Brandeis, BC, and the seven sisters. Kinda like NYU in NYC except with far less academic prestige, slightly better financial aid, less intellectually capable students, and a more jock/frat/sorority party school vibe. The first and last were reasons why I never bothered to apply there, especially after visiting the campus, chatting with friends who went there, and seeing what went on and around the campus.

In fact your comparison sounded similar to a younger cousin's struggle earlier this summer between going to BC or Vassar even though they're also not remotely in the same academic league.

Though she wanted the former for its Boston location despite the fact it is located just outside of it, everything else about her academic/creative artsy interests, her personality, not caring about sports/school spirit, and her preference for small intellectually stimulating environments meant that Vassar was a far better fit for her. Thankfully she chose wisely and will be attending Vassar this fall.

58.<<<IvyPBear>>>
"As with UMich, McGill is considered on par with the Ivies by employers and grad school admissions officers."

I would say UMich is a tier or two above McGill at the undergrad level. The quality of undergraduate public education in the US is superior to that in Canada.

59.<<<Aniger>>>
So everyone agrees UMich trumps McGill which trumps BU. My son is clearly in at McGill, so to me it doesn't make any sense to even to apply to BU. But one of my son's science teachers has many friends teaching at BU and is convincing my son that it is highly undervalued and that particularly in science it is very good. And my son does like Boston. Oh well, more choices are good.

60.<<<par72>>>
UMichigan academics probably comparable to Tufts in the Boston area. Michigan >BC or BU with much older acacdemic tradition with the Wolverines. BU, BC, and Northeastern are old rivals among themselves.

"I would say UMich is a tier or two above McGill at the undergrad level. The quality of undergraduate public education in the US is superior to that in Canada. "

Funny, I heard the exact opposite from Ivy/Ivy-level faculty, students who have studied at both institutions, and a college classmate who now teaches at UBC. The last in particular said with few exceptions...the teaching/intellectual level at Canadian public unis is far higher than most except possibly the top-tier publics like Berkeley, UMich, and UVA.

"But one of my son's science teachers has many friends teaching at BU and is convincing my son that it is highly undervalued and that particularly in science it is very good. And my son does like Boston. Oh well, more choices are good. "

First, the science departments at Brandeis, Tufts, and BC tend to be stronger than BU from what I've heard.

More importantly, is your son an aspiring scientist or pre-med?

One thing to be aware of is that most Boston area universities' science departments like the ones I listed above tend to be more oriented towards pre-meds. While this does not necessarily affect the quality of the education, it could negatively affect your son's college experience due to the cutthroat grade grubbing, greater unforgiving curves in intro science courses, and being around extremely "mercenary" students who aren't really interested in learning anything beyond getting high grades necessary for med school admission.

Comparatively speaking, UMich's science departments send their graduates to both medical and science PhD programs so there's a greater mix of students genuinely interested in science vs the pre-professional pre-med type students friends TA undergrad courses keep ranting about.

"UMichigan academics probably comparable to Tufts in the Boston area. Michigan >BC or BU with much older acacdemic tradition with the Wolverines. BU, BC, and Northeastern are old rivals among themselves. "

Overall, UMich > Tufts, Brandeis, BC, BU, etc. On the other hand, with a few exceptions, they tend to be a little below MIT and Harvard.

I've always found this line of reasoning somewhat difficult to follow. Would BU be better, perhaps, if it were magically transported to Montana? :confused: After all, it would be the best school in the state and perhaps the best in the Rockies region.

The other Boston schools are nothing to sneeze at, which I'm sure you know since you frequently recommend Northeastern; discounting a college because it is in the vicinity of Harvard but not as good is somewhat odd and smacks of insecurity.

It's best to simply say that McGill is stronger than BU in most areas, which is more succinct and accurate.

63.<<<sefago>>>
McGill is decent but its not as good as most people think it is at the undergraduate level. It would not be better than BU academics wise but if you care about perception then yes McGill is viewed as better. Even the BU vs Michigan discussion- I would wager that the academics at both schools are the around the same- all the Michigan pom-pom boys love overrating an decent public school at the undergraduate level into a super elite school. Its not as if the academic curriculum at Michigan is specially crafted by a God. BU would have a standard and I am sure its at par with most schools in the US.

McGill would be around the same as UMich but thats it- A top 30-35 US school at most. University of Toronto is even better than McGill, people should do their research better and stop focussing on "perceptions" or subjective judgement.

***, UMich>Tufts lol. You mean UMich's graduate departments are better than Tufts. Tufts is a rigorous LAC-type school which screws it up since most people only know famous research schools. I wonder what would be your view of Williams (a school whose departments cannot be ranked vs. UMich or Berkeley.

The quality of a typical public undergraduate education in the US is superior to the quality of a typical public education in Canada. There are very smart students at both McGill and UMich, but the overall quality of UMich is higher at the undergrad level. At the graduate level, the two are about equivalent in terms of research.

I agree with sefago. Undergraduate programs at UMich and Tufts are comparable; there are very smart students at both of these schools.

I'd place Williams far above UMich as Williams is more comparable to the HYPSM level of the Ivies. However, Tufts is certainly no Williams....

Moreover, UMich is strong in nearly every department at the undergrad level comparable to the lower-level Ivies whereas Tufts is very uneven in this regard. For instance, its science departments are overwhelmingly oriented towards pre-meds rather than aspiring scientists and their engineering school can't hold a candle to either UMich or McGill at the undergrad level.

They do have IR/poli-sci due to their ties with the Fletcher school, but other than that, they're not that much different from any other SLAC below the lowest rungs of the Ivy level.

Rhodes Scholars by school. UMichigan 25, BU 8, Holy Cross 5, Tufts 4, Brandeis 2 , BC2. With only 2800 undergrads at Holy Cross vs Michigan's 26000, BU 18000, BC 9-10,000, Holy Cross does a great job.

"lesdiablesbleus, Michigan and Tufts are not comparable. Both are excellent in their own way, but Michigan's peers are Cal, Cornell, Northwestern and Penn, whereas Tufts peers are Emory, Georgetown, Rice and Vanderbilt. "

Subjective assessment. I personally dont consider UMich equivalent to cornell or NW. A tier below them. I subjectively consider Rice for example to be at par with Ivies and such schools but not UMich. I consider peers of UMich at the undergraduate level to be around USC/Tufts/WFU.

Considering the fact that students at Emory, Georgetown and Rice are statistically better than UMich, I wonder what makes UMich better or special at the undergraduate level than these colleges.

Not sure the number of Rhodes Scholars per school is a good metric as there may be a fair amount of academic/institutional politics involved. Knew a few classmates who ended up being screwed because one of the interviewers was a retired military officer with an open bias against institutions he perceived as too favorable to GBLT students. Granted, this was more than a decade ago and I hoped that interviewer has been replaced for the sake of subsequent Rhodes candidates.

"I'd place Williams far above UMich as Williams is more comparable to the HYPSM level of the Ivies. However, Tufts is certainly no Williams...."

Why do you think so? You think UMich is better than Tufts probably because it has better graduate/NRC departments. But there is no way for you to compare Williams to UMich except by your subjective opinion. It follows that rigorous LAC schools like Tufts who have the misfortune of having a few graduate schools placing them in the USNWR section would be seen as subpar because they dont shine at the graduate level despite providing their students with training possible superior to Mich or berkeley.

You are downplaying Tufts, Brandeis based on one factor while excluding that factor when you are comparing Williams to UMich. Doesn't that look a bit weird . . . you are not performing a uniform comparison.

Durhhh....Emory, Gtown and Rice are a fraction the size of Michigan. Expand Emory or Gtown to Michigan's size and I doubt they'd have stronger student averages.

Michigan offers many more great academic program variety than Emory, Gtown or Rice...all of this in a fine college town instead of a mega city with big college athletics. That is what makes UMich better at the undergraduate level. Different strokes for different folks.

74.<<<informative>>>
Michigan v. Tufts:
Hard to compare. Both are excellent schools, but this is apples to oranges.

Brandeis:
Has a decent business school, but not much else. Often discussed as a slightly overranked school.

Williams:
It is hard to compare Williams to a giant national university, but Williams (and Amherst) are still the cream of the LAC crop, and they are significant universities. Unless you are looking at a hard science degree, Williams (and amherst) are going to be better on most levels than any of the large public universities, including the great ones like Michigan.

Holy Cross:
Holy Cross is a good school, but by no means is it even in the sam epicture as Tufts/BC, let alone Michigan, and definitely not even in the same world as Williams. Not sure why that guy brought it up, as it is not even being discussed.

75.<<<cobrat>>>
"You are downplaying Tufts, Brandeis based on one factor while excluding that factor when you are comparing Williams to UMich. Doesn't that look a bit weird . . . you are not performing a uniform comparison. "

I'm sorry, but while Tufts and Brandeis are highly respectable schools, they are certainly are not ranked at the lowest rungs of the Ivy-types based on academic quality across the board. I already outlined the unevenness of Tufts' overall academic quality in two areas.

As for Brandeis, other than English, history, math, and Near-East studies and their sciences which is also overwhelmingly geared towards pre-meds and not aspiring scientists....the rest of their programs are so-so.

Moreover, I had one friend who transferred from Brandeis with a 3.7+ college GPA with advanced coursework there who ended up struggling with C/C- level grades and even failing a few courses before floundering to graduation two years behind schedule with barely a 3.0 cumulative GPA from Oberlin.

76.<<<par72>>>
Small liberal arts schools like Williams, Bowdoin and Holy Cross offer small class size,most if not all classes taught by full-time Profs. vs graduate assistants, and alumni networks with giving rates exceeding most Ivies. Michigan and CAL are huge by comparison with extensive graduate offerings.

77.<<<sefago>>>
"Durhhh....Emory, Gtown and Rice are a fraction the size of Michigan. Expand Emory or Gtown to Michigan's size and I doubt they'd have stronger student averages."

Expand Gtown, Emory, and Vanderbilt's faculty size to make them research intensive. Find ways of spending more $$$ on research and these schools would have graduate standings at par with Mich/Berkeley. Michigan and berkeley get a significant part of their reputation from their size.

But Emory, Gtown and Rice or Vanderbilt were not set up to cater for large students- they are primarily liberal art type colleges with some professional schools and a bit of research. If their professors are dedicated to rigorously training their students as opposed to to conducting the same level of research as Mich/Berkeley- what says thats wrong.

78.<<<sefago>>>
Thats not the point of my argument though. I am just pointing out that opinions are subjective and usually unbalanced. For example Williams has no famous department except maybe art history, but everyone in " the know"knows its a great school. However the standards for comparison change quickly when you shift to tufts- which is a similar LAC. Does not make sense. Dartmouth has very few top 10 departments if any at all, but never have I heard Dartmouth being called academically below UMich before. Neither does Brown have anything distinguishable. The only thing special about them is that they are Ivies. Rarely have I heard the argument that Michigan's or berkeley's academics are superior to these schools. However people are quick to berate Rice/Vanderbilt and Emory which have several better ranked departments than Brown or Dartmouth.

So really I am confused and I would pose this question again and again on CC- why can people not stick to one uniform definition of academics?

Michigan and CAL are huge by comparison with extensive graduate offerings. "

Regarding graduate offerings, keep in mind that the close faculty student interaction combined with high academic standards at the topflight small LACs means that many upper-level and even some intermediate undergrad courses at such institutions may be comparable to graduate courses at Research I universities.

A reason so many friends from my LAC thrived in graduate school...including many Ivy/Ivy-types like Berkeley and MIT compared to those who graduated from larger research 1 universities including many Ivies.

80.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
[quote]why can people not stick to one uniform definition of academics?[/quote]
Because people study different things...prefer different things, etc.

There are only a handful of schools that offer tremendous depth across the entire range of academic disciplines.

81.<<<sefago>>>
^ Still not getting my point- why would Alexandre for example create a tier which suggests that Brown and dartmouth are stronger schools than Rice when most of Rice departments are on par with Brown and superior to dartmouth? Then switch the metrics when comparing UMich to Rice, and start discussing how the graduate department at Mich are better than Rice (forgetting the fact that Mich's faculty is several times larger). If you analyze rice carefully on a per capita basis of faculty research putput and not on subjective opinion- most people would be aware that its as top as it gets.

82.<<<par72>>>
Top LAC's with strong alumni giving rates(>50%)-Amherst, Williams, Davidson, Holy Cross, Bowdoin , and Colgate are able to offer good financial aid and help in job placement. With weak/poor economy, most public universities face budget cuts.

^ I don't know. Rice is great...no question. I especially admire its engineering and might personally prefer it over a Dartmouth (never been to either). There are historical and geographical factors in play too...not saying it's right or wrong, but Texas (particularly Houston) doesn't get much credit. This is gonna shift the thread into an entirely different discussion as we're discussing topics debated here continuously:
private vs. public, research university vs. LAC, Ivy vs. non-Ivy, coastal biases, liberal elite bias...etc...

Oberlin must be one of the most rigorous schools in the US then lol . . . considering the statistics of the people that get into Oberlin, and from your anecdotes that Harvard was easier, I think its safe to assume that 80% of the students at Oberlin must be failing. Or grew significantly smarter and more hardworking while in college.

Your opinion on UMich being greater than Tufts is because of its graduate departments since there is really no way for you to compare both schools academically. It follows that people's opinion here that UMich is better than Boston U is based largely on the graduate departments of UMich rather than any real knowledge of what happens at BU. If I was to use the same method of comparison in which you compare Tufts departments to Mich, I should confidently be able to assert that Mich are academically superior to Williams. But you assert the contrary.

Most people here just spew academics but when you ask them to qualify it they start floudering like a fish caught in a hook

I think its a bit related. If we can all agree that we know nothing about the academics of BU and most of the schools we rank, I think it would give the OP some fresh air. People are working on their perceptions- I personally think for example that all publics are just decent at the undergraduate level (but I am pretty much aware that this perception is based on my bias and anecdotal views)

Obviously, you ignored the part where I said Tufts' undergrad engineering program cannot hold a candle to UMich's and their science departments are overwhelmingly geared to pre-meds at the expense of aspiring scientists...a common complaint among friends who were non pre-med science majors at Tufts whereas UMich's science departments cater to both groups well. UMich also has more strengths across the board in the humanities and social science departments.

As for BU....I am still wondering on what basis you feel BU and UMich are equal academically for undergrad? That's certainly not the experience of many Boston area locals who considered it a "rich kid's safety school" for kids who were rejected from Harvard, Tufts, BC, and the seven sisters. In fact, I witnessed one local advising an NEU student who was hoping to transfer up by telling him to not undersell himself by considering BU as it wouldn't be much of an improvement.

They are separate schools. You should be extremely proud of yourself kb10 for going to GRADUATE SCHOOL at Michigan because it is one of the 10 greatest overall graduate schools in the world.

Why would you would want to associate yourself with an undergraduate program that is not even top 25 in the country?

Also, if we were to include graduate schools, something crazy like 1 out of 10 Americans are technically "Michigan alums". What would be then so special about being part of an alumni network where everyone and their mother is already a part of? What's the incentive for a Michigan employer to look out for a Wolverine when there are 5 other Michigan grads applying for the same position?

"Also, if we were to include graduate schools, something crazy like 1 out of 10 Americans are technically '"Michigan alums"'.

I find that statistic a little hard to believe. Is there a source for that? While I agree that Michigan is a big school, and that it might be getting too overcrowded, I still don't feel that it's the diploma-mill factory that many people make it out to be. And rankings are subjective.

As to the original topic of this thread, I can't really tell you which is a better school. While I personally love UMich and the town of Ann Arbor, Boston is probably even larger and very well might have more to offer as a city. I've never been there though, so I can't really speak from personal experience.

Why would you would want to associate yourself with an undergraduate program that is not even top 25 in the country?"

No they are not. Michigan is one university and most of its alums do not attempt to differentiate. Michigan's graduate progams are ranked among the top 10 because there aren't as many graduate programs as undergraduate programs. Just because one ranking with a methodology that favors smaller private universities does not rank Michigan undergrad among the top 25 does not make it so. There are so many excellent undergraduate programs in the nation that there is no clear cut top 10 or top 25 university. Let us face it, outside of the HYPSM fivesome, there is no real difference between the top 25 or top 30 universities. That is not the case with graduate programs, where there is a clear cut top 10 or top 15.

"Also, if we were to include graduate schools, something crazy like 1 out of 10 Americans are technically "Michigan alums". What would be then so special about being part of an alumni network where everyone and their mother is already a part of?"

1 in 10 huh? How do you figure? 450,000 living alums (350,000 living in the US) out of a population of 310,000,000. If my math is correct, that's more like 1 in 700. And if having a large alumni body somehow dilutes the brand of a university, would you say Harvard is not respected? They have 320,000 living alums. Columbia and Penn each have about 300,000 living alums.

"What's the incentive for a Michigan employer to look out for a Wolverine when there are 5 other Michigan grads applying for the same position?"

As many alums and recent graduates as Michigan may have, their extremely diverse interests generally ensures that not many apply for similar positions. I have not often had to compete with another Wolverine for the same job.

91.<<<Alexandre>>>
sefago, Tufts is not a similar LAC to Williams. Tufts isn't even a LAC. Tufts has 9,500 students (over 4,000 of which are graduate students), making it 3 times large than the larger LACs and 4-5 times larger than most LACs. I agree that Tufts is a quasi-LAC, like Vanderbilt or Emory, but it is not a LAC.

And I never said Michigan was superor to Tufts, I said they are not comparable. They are too different.

92.<<<nemom>>>
BU is far stronger than it was in the past. It's been ramping things up for years and the effect is obvious. Some departments are stronger than others. Classics , math , theater are some of the strongest.
BU is in Boston. There is a lot to do and see. Theater district is small but very strong, and the music scene is excellent. It's a city full of people who actually read, make music, and art. The BU campus is in the middle of it all and you can walk to Fenway - the best ball park in America. There's great food , much of cheap too. If you like NE skiing, it's a day trip.
I don't know much about Michigan. It's got a huge campus and lots of sports.

93.<<<informative>>>
Actually, most have the sentiment that BU has really fallen off since the 90s. The admin has increased the size of the university to the point where there is no campus identity or school spirit, classes are usually lectures style seminars and the degree does not have much cache anymore (likely due to it being considered the go-to safety school due to its easy admissions). The grade deflation issue (google it) is a significant concern for most people I speak with regarding BU, especially if graduate school is something you are interested in.

Do you think NYU is one the same level as Columbia? Do you think Tufts is on the same level as Caltech? Do you think Wake Forest is on the same level as Penn? Do you think Michigan is on the same level as Dartmouth?

I've never really understood the separation you make between HYPSM and the next 25 universities on this site. Duke is a lot closer to Stanford statistically than UNC is to Duke for instance. If you want to be this elitist, then the conversation starts and ends with Harvard. Why include Yale, Princeton, Stanford and MIT in the same class? Harvard has better selectivity, more financial resources, a higher endowment, significantly more fellowship winners (Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, etc.), better faculty, etc. etc.

Here is the list that was agreed upon by all my college friends who are scattered across various top universities in the US:

Tier 1
Harvard

Tier 2
Yale
Princeton
Stanford
MIT
Caltech

Tier 3
Brown
Duke
Dartmouth
Chicago
Penn
Columbia

Tier 4
Cornell
Georgetown
Northwestern
JHU
Emory
Vanderbilt
Wash U
Rice
Notre Dame

Tier 5
UNC
Michigan
Berkeley
UCLA
UVA
USC
Wake Forest
Tufts
CMU

Either admit that all top schools are virtually the same or separate universities more vigorously like in the manner I prescribed with the above example Alexandre. No one in the professional or academic world agrees with your HYPSM and then "the rest" arbitrary tiering system.

95.<<<Alexandre>>>
Yes, Michigan is at the same level as Dartmouth, albeit in a very different way. Your tiers are completely inconsistant. Cal, Cornell, JHU, Michigan and Northwestern are in the same league as your tier 3 schools. Furthermore, the remaining tier 4 and tier 5 schools can all be lumped together into one tier.

Lesdiablesbleu, you should learn about universities before you post such incorrect information. I have 15 years more experience than you (and far more knowledge about universities than you do) and I hesitate to state my opinion half as freely as you do.

96.<<<lesdiablesbleus>>>
Alexandre,

What does experience have to do with anything? If a 50 year-old Nobel Prize winner were to suggest to me that he thinks Wash U is better than Harvard, then I would still think that he's wrong. This isn't theory or speculation; my ranking systems are based on perceptions of prestige that are corroborated my plenty of data and statistics.

Dartmouth has a better professional and academic reputation than Michigan. This isn't a matter that is debatable. Top firms in virtually every industry like The Parthenon Group (management consulting), Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (retail), the Gehrson Lehman Group (expertise) and SIG Susquehanna (proprietary trading) recruit at Dartmouth while they don't recruit at Michigan.

Name one TOP COMPANY that recruits at Michigan but doesn't go to Dartmouth. I doubt you could find one.

A key question: what are you likely to learn in a UMich classroom that you couldn't learn in a BU classroom? I'd guess the answer is not much. Keep in mind that for many academics, the Boston area a great place to be; the idea that Michigan's faculty is superior in any way that would significantly impact an undergrad is putting way too much faith in rankings.

98.<<<sefago>>>
@Alexandre

I know its rude to interrupt posts so I would first apologize then:

I think lesdiablesbleus is talking about undergraduate education especially as seen by most people in college right now. Michigan is not even close to Dartmouth in terms of reputation. Do not quote the academic scores of USNWR because the graduate schools cause a bias in the results. Dartmouth is at least a tier more solid than at the undergraduate level than UMich. Alexandre, i think no matter how you rank on CC, thats never going to change the actual perception. Also no offence, I find it hard to believe you know what is currently happening in undergraduate college in the US right now since you are currently in Dubai. Most of your knowledge would be based on online analysis, meeting and discussing with past alumnis from those school at best.
[quote]Lesdiablesbleu, you should learn about universities before you post such incorrect information. I have 15 years more experience than you (and far more knowledge about universities than you do) and I hesitate to state my opinion half as freely as you do.[/quote]

Alexandre, you have been posting your tier system consistently and I doubt people have argued that you have posted incorrect information. Most have said you post biased information which might be true. Lesdiablesbleus ranking reflects a Northeast bias though- I would bet he is from the Northeast. I dont know if it is right and neither do i care.

Nevertheless, I dont think you would know about a university just based on observation and researching. You need information from people who have experienced the education of the school. Lesdiablesbleu's tiering reflects how schools are currently viewed by students now in the school. These students are even more likely to judge a school than the academics who really have not being in the undergraduate system for more than 15 years.
[quote]And I never said Michigan was superor to Tufts, I said they are not comparable. They are too different.
<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">
Even further you claim that Mich is comparable to Dartmouth but not Tufts. The undergraduate education at Michigan is not in the i same league as Michigan. At the graduate level and on a departmental basis Michigan is better than Dartmouth in nearly every department. So in what way are they comparable exactly?

Oh I forgot, Dartmouth is ivy league and a top 10-12 university at the undergraduate level so it would be great to link Michigan to it. But Tufts, a university quite organized like a liberal art college just like dartmouth but not that highly ranked is "too different." Just looking at the student size at Tufts does not tell you that. Interacting with Tufts student does. Tufts is very much a liberal art school- it has around 5000+ undergrads.

Sefago, if you re-read the first line of post #95, I clearly state that Michigan is very different from Dartmouth. And why are you so defensive about Tufts? I also said Tufts was excellent.

At any rate, when I say Michigan (and Cal, Cornell, JHU and Northwestern) is as good as Dartmouth (or Brown, Chicago, Duke or Penn), I am also referring purely to undergraduate education. At the graduate level, Michigan would rank between #4 and #8 in the US and is superior to half of the schools that lesdiablesbleus placed in thier 3. That does not mean that those schools are all interchangeable, and I admit as much. If you want to compare universities according to likeness and not quality, Michigan's peers are Cal, Cornell, Northwestern, Penn, UCLA, UNC, UT-Austin and Wisconsin. Michigan shares some similarities with Chicago, Columbia, Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Michigan has virtually nothing in common with Brown, Dartmouth, Duke, Princeton and Yale.

No offense Sefago, but anybody who does not count Michigan among the top universities in the nation is ignorant. There is no clear cut top 10 or top 25 university, but no educated person with true experience would claim that a school like Dartmouth is superior to Michigan. And this is not a recent development either. Michigan was considered among the academic elite (arguably among the top 5 universities in the US) in the late 19th century.

Lesdiablesbleus, I will not compare on-campus recruitment at Michigan to on-campus recruitment at Dartmouth...for the sake of the latter, not the former. Dartmouth would find itself on the losing end of that battle. Suffice it to say, virtually every single BB IBank and Management Consulting lists Michigan among their very short list of strategic campuses and recruit Michigan students very aggressively. Smaller and highly exclusive boutiques, like Allen &amp; Company, BlackRock, Blackstone, Evercore, Greenhill, Lazard and Moelis also recruit at Michigan.

I am sure there are a couple of major financial and consulting firms that recruit at Dartmouth and not at Michigan, but I am just as sure that there are a couple such firms that recruit at Michigan and not at Dartmouth. But when you get past those two industries, the number of major firms that recruit at Michigan far exceeds the number of major firms that recruit at Dartmouth.

But there is no proof of this. The best I can go by is the quality of undergrads at Michigan and at michigan is not impressive. And this is way below that at Dartmouth and company even in science and engineering classes.

And these "academic elites" are not judging the undergraduate program at UMich- they are judging the whole university. Considering the fact that a large number of academics would have done graduate school/post-doc at Berkeley, UMich or have collagues who have done so e.t.c its pretty easy to see the obvious bias.

In all fairness to Dartmouth- Michigan is close to 6.5-7 times its size.

Also the numbers of Dartmouth ppl at MC and Ibanks would be larger than Mich more likely even by raw numbers alone

I think personally I have been offtopic myself. Back to topic though

"Because your criteria for comparing universities is not clearly defined."

Actually Sefago, my criteria have often been laid out. Quality of faculty, quality of facilities, breadth and depth of curriculum, academic reputation in academe and professional recruitment on campus. On a more abstract level, academic versitality and diversity, research activity and intellectual vitality on and off campus play a part.

"The best I can go by is the quality of undergrads at Michigan and at michigan is not impressive. And this is way below that at Dartmouth and company even in science and engineering classes."

That is a single criteria Sefago, and although Dartmouth does edge Michigan in this regard, the edge is neither significant, nor meaningful. That is not to say that the quality of a student body is not a criterion in determining quality of academics offered at a university, but it is not the only one, nor does it outweigh all other factors, individually or combined. I also find it pretty arrogant when somebody is not impressed by the quality of the Michigan student body. There are literally thousands of undergraduate students of the highest caliber enrolled at Michigan at any point in time. Since 1993, Michigan has produced more Fullbright scholars (350) than any university in the US save Harvard, Yale and Cal. I think Dartmouth produced 80 or so, which is also impressive considering its size. In that same period, Michigan has enrolled more students into top graduate programs than all but 4 or 5 universities in the nation. Even as a ratio of the total student population, Michigan (which has a higher ratio of non Arts and Science students than most elite universities) would rank among the top 20 universities (LACs not included as we are talking about national research universities). But in terms of absolute numbers, Michigan would definitely be among the top 10 and arguably among the top 5. How can that be if the students were truly not "impressive"?

"No offense taken. I still dont count Michigan in the top 20 at least for undergraduate education, excluding liberal art colleges. Dartmouth is superior to Michigan, period. I dont think much can be done to convince me otherwise- I have seen enough of Michigan to form my own conclusions."

Fair enough.

"I am sure the period you are talking about is the US NEWS academic peer rating. And these "academic elites" are not judging the undergraduate program at UMich- they are judging the whole university. Considering the fact that a large number of academics would have done graduate school/post-doc at Berkeley, UMich or have collagues who have done so e.t.c its pretty easy to see the obvious bias."

Not really Sefago. I am fairly certain that a very small percentage of the people behind the Academic reputation rating attended Michigan or Cal or have loyalty to those institutions for whatever other reason. I am surprised that you accuse people who think highly of Michigan of being biased. And even if it were so, aren't those who think highly of other universities also biased?

"In all fairness to Dartmouth- Michigan is close to 6.5-7 times its size. Considering the fact that Dartmouth students want to stay in the Northeast as opposed to the south/midwest (where most engineering firms are located), it would be a waste of time and money for most companies to come to Dartmouth. Also the numbers of Dartmouth ppl at MC and Ibanks would be larger than Mich more likely even by raw numbers alone."

Do you have proof to back your claim? I would say that the placement rate (qualified students applying for such jobs who actually get offers) for Michigan students is as high as it is for Dartmouth students, but I have no figures to validate this claim. I do have raw placement figures for Ross students (which enrolls the lion's share of Michigan students interested in such careers), and they are pretty impressive, but as long as Dartmouth does not publish placement figures, we will never know how it stacks up against Michigan. I actually ran a quick comparison between Ross and Wharton from 2006 until 2010 just a couple of days ago. I looked at the placement numbers into 9 large IBanks (Barclays since 2009, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutschebank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers until 2008, Morgan Stanley and UBS) and 4 major Management Consulting firms (Bain, BCG, Booz and McKinsey). Over that 5-year period, 30% of Wharton students were placed in those 13 companies, compared to 20% of Ross students. I doubt Dartmouth had higher placement numbers into those companies than Wharton, which means that their placement figures were probably not much more (if at all) impressive than Michigan's.

"A key question: what are you likely to learn in a UMich classroom that you couldn't learn in a BU classroom?"

The same thing could be said for virtually any school in this country with that simplistic statement. Certainly Boston College would be included in that same train of thought..........

105.<<<IvyPBear>>>
My college friends would agree with lesdiablesbleus's list. Tier 4 and tier 5 can be merged though. I don't completely understand why people when went to school 1 on this board act like they just got slapped in the face when people post something like the average student at school 2 is smarter than the average student at school 1. Either they don't understand that top students at most of the top 50 schools are about the same in terms of smartness and feel the need to defend their own school, or they were average students (and so did get slapped in the face).

"I looked at the placement numbers into 9 large IBanks (Barclays since 2009, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutschebank, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers until 2008, Morgan Stanley and UBS) and 4 major Management Consulting firms (Bain, BCG, Booz and McKinsey).

I doubt Dartmouth had higher placement numbers into those companies than Wharton, which means that their placement figures were probably not much more (if at all) impressive than Michigan's."

Alexandre - I don't think you really understand what makes undergraduate programs at Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, Stanford, and MIT special. Yes, there are very smart people at top flagships and top privates, but the concentration of smart people is a lot higher at schools like Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, etc. Your placement numbers are misleading (or incomplete to say the least). First, it doesn't say whether the students were placed into front office, middle office, or back office. Second, since you use banks and management consulting firms as the criteria for success, I don't think you understand that the very top students gun for elite buy-side firms like Bain Cap, Blackstone, Bridgewater, Citadel, etc. Investment banks and management consulting firms are usually the plan B for student at Wharton, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, etc. Top employers (which is the best measure of percentage of students going into certain firms) at Wharton, Harvard, Princeton, Dartmouth, Columbia, Duke, etc. are Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, etc. Can the same be said of UMich and other top public schools? No. And, don't give me the "students at UMich aren't as interested in making money" argument. Don't misunderstand me, the top hundred or 5-10% of students at UMich are just as capable as the to 5-10% at any Ivy. The average student at UMich isn't as smart as the average one at Columbia, Dartmouth, Brown, etc.

106.<<<IvyPBear>>>
I went the #3 law school in the US (sometimes #2), and I'm not ashamed to say the average student there is not as smart as the average one at Yale Law School, although the top 10% at both law schools are about equal; it's just the truth. Same goes for colleges.

107.<<<sefago>>>
^ true. However, I also think a major problem comes from people not knowing what goes on in a school and are quick to rank it. I am sure Alexandre had a great academic experience in UMich to place it so highly. Other students at Emory or Vandy or tufts might feel too that they got a rigorous education and deserve to be a tier above certain schools. But sometimes you have to avoid bias in forming opinions.

Tier 4 and tier 5 can certainly being merged, with Northwestern, JHU, Berkeley and Rice (A school of 8,000 with a huge research citation impact) being the strongest in the group.

108.<<<SpringForever>>>
I agree with IvyPBear. I attend Dartmouth, and I won't hesitate to admit that the average student at Harvard is smarter than the average student at Dartmouth. The top 10% of the students are very much comparable though simply from the fact that they usually end up at Harvard Med, Mayo, Yale Law, HBS (straight from undergrad), Wharton (straight from undergrad), Blackstone, Bain Cap, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, Stanford statistics PhD, etc. You can replace "Dartmouth" with "Columbia," "Princeton," "MIT," "Penn," "Duke," "Berkeley," "Williams," "UMich," "UVa," "Rice," etc. and the statement would be just as true.

109.<<<IvyPBear>>>
I'm sure Alexandre is a smart person and had a great experience at UMich. My comment was not referring to UMich specifically. I think the most obvious example of what I was saying is Cornell. Whenever someone insinuates that the average student at Cornell is not as smart as one at Columbia. A frenzy starts, and defenders pops out from everywhere to point out how Cornell CAS has SAT comparable to Columbia, how Cornell engineering is the best in the Ivy League, how the president of Czech Republic is an alum, and other facts irrelevant to whether the question of whether the average student at Cornell is as smart as the average one at Columbia.

It might be a "simplified" way to look at it, but that doesn't make it irrelevant. In fact it's about as relevant as it can get. All of this hand-wringing over which school is better academically (not just Michigan vs. BU, but all the other comparisons on cc), and you concede that there really isn't a significant difference in what someone could learn at Respectable College X and Respectable College Y? That's the house of cards that collegeconfidential is built upon...that you can actually learn something in the classrooms at Cornell that you can't learn at Kansas State.
