Hello everyone!

2.<<<Darkfeind>>>
Btw apologies for my username it was supposed to be friend and not feind.

3.<<<Senior2016M>>>
Firstly, HUGE congratulations on your acceptances to both of these schools as an international! That is an extraordinary achievement, and just goes to show what a wonderful person you must be. I know you will succeed at either of these colleges based on what you have said, so I wouldn't worry about making a 'wrong' decision here - you really can't.

For the areas of study you have described, Harvard is arguably the stronger of the two, given the more economics/humanities focus you have outlined above. In general, Stanford is more STEM oriented than anything else, which is not to say that it doesn't have excellent offerings in the humanities or anything, but is just a sort of cultural element of studying in the silicon valley. Regarding the freedom of courses, both institutions have comparably structured curricula to my knowledge - not as open and free hand as Brown, nor as prescriptive and core-centric as UChicago, but just somewhere in the middle, maybe toward Brown on the spectrum.

Lifestyle is a big one here, and it's really a matter of who you are. I think my Stanford friends have a better work-life balance than do my Harvard friends. There is a more "school pride" sort of culture at Stanford with sports etc. but ultimately I think a noticeable plus that leads to 'happier' people at Stanford is the weather. Boston is COLD. Like, SERIOUSLY cold, so unless you love snow and winter and ice, you may find the winters quite unbearable at first (depending on what sort of climate you're used to in your home country). But a good winter jacket solves most of that so certainly don't make your decision based on it, but weather and lifestyle are notable considerations for four years of your life.

Either school will give you an amazing education and prepare you for the next chapter and help you grow as a person. Job prospects and the like are also identical between the two - both well known, both brand name diplomas that will catch someone's eye and help push you forward for opportunities. So whatever you decide, know that it's the right decision! Because you absolutely can't go wrong. Good luck!

Stanford is the future; Harvard is the present.

5.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I'd generally agree with @Senior2016M - both are great, you won't go wrong with either, Harvard probably has an edge in the subjects you're interested in, Stanford has better weather. One other thing to consider is, since you're planning on returning to your home country, how the relative networks of each school compare there. I would guess you might find that among the people you're going to want to work with / get to know, there may be more with Harvard connections.

I wouldn't base my decision on evidence-free statements like "Stanford is the future; Harvard is the present". There is no wrong choice here.

6.<<<Darkfeind>>>
Thank you for the response!
Generally speaking, Harvard is more well-renowned in my own country as compared to Stanford. However, school name and prestige doesn't matter to me that much. An overall educational experience which aligns better with my interests is definitely my priority.
As far as the weather is concerned though i don't know if i should base my decision entirely on it. It has admittedly been a concern of mine as i don't like cold weather(particularly if it's cold AND wet). I've heard Boston winters can be brutal, and where I come from the weather can get pretty hot(>40 C) in the summers and can go as low as 0 C(minimum) in the winters.

Why did you apply to Stanford? And why did you apply to Harvard? The reasons may still be the same for choosing one of them. Pick one and don't look back. You will never know "what if".

8.<<<jym626>>>
Please tell us more about the full ride for an international to these schools.

9.<<<Darkfeind>>>
Well to be very honest with you, as an International applicant asking for a lot of aid my choice of colleges was limited. Even among them i never thought I'd get into either Harvard or Stanford let alone both so i never really considered this question up until i got into Stanford, and now that i have to make this decision about how and where to spend the next four years of my life I thought i'd seek help from those better informed than me so that i have more information before making this decision.
As far as the aid is concerned I have to pay for health insurance and my travelling expenses at Stanford which is ~5k $ p.a. and nothing at Harvard.

My son had to decide between Stanford and Harvard (and a few other top schools) a couple of years ago, and the choice between these two particular schools wasn't hard for him. Although Harvard arguably still has, in the world at large (and in non-tech fields) a bigger name, the undergraduate experience struck us as less desirable. Aside from obvious differences like the weather and immediate surroundings, Harvard just seemed less friendly and less interested in making the undergraduate experience great (and fun). My son wanted a top-notch education at a school where undergraduate life was a priority and where he'd have a reasonably good chance of being happy on a daily basis. He struggled a lot between Stanford and Yale, but Harvard was always beneath them in his rankings. He ultimately chose Stanford and hasn't regretted his choice. That said, I think it really depends on the individual. Harvard has a lot to offer, and some people prefer the atmosphere (and even weather) there, which is very different. On the surface, it seems more dynamic; Cambridge is definitely a more crowded, urban, and stimulating place than Palo Alto, and its access to Boston is much easier than Palo Alto's is to San Francisco. But both schools attract similar students and professors, so intellectually you should be able to find what you want at either. Weather wasn't a huge factor for my son when he made his decision, but it's a big one for him nowhe loves Stanford's climate and now complains when there's prolonged rain, which there was for a while this year. Since he's been to the East Coast many times before in the summer and winter, he has a real basis for comparison on that score. Good luck with your decisionboth Harvard and Stanford are great schools with big names and extensive alumni networks, so you really can't go wrong either way.

12.<<<potterfan>>>
I'm also an international student who had to make this decision last year. Ultimately, I chose Stanford and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. It's true that Stanford is more STEM oriented, bur it also has an amazing humanities department. The people are friendly, the weather is nice (I thought it was hot, but it's not), there's tons of olympic athletes (I love sports, so I really take pride in Stanford's athletics) and the academics are World renown.
I'm obviously biased towards Stanford, but maybe making a pro and contra con list would help. If you need any help, don't hesitate in asking me.

13.<<<potterfan>>>
Wow, I just realized hiw many typos I had. Sorry, I was on my phone.

14.<<<websensation>>>
Just visit and go to one you like better.

15.<<<Chrchill>>>
Harvard grad here, and I say Stanford.

16.<<<sbballer>>>
Yes Boston can be brutal during the winter.. but there can be a lot of rain in the winter at Stanford so keep that in mind.

It's not all palm trees and sunshine:)

And I would absolutely visit both campuses and talk with the students.

17.<<<Darkfeind>>>
Unfortunately, I will not be able to visit either campus since I am an international and live really far away.

18.<<<DHMchicago>>>
Degrees from both, interview for Stanford. I recall recently reading about an obscenely high proportion of Harvard grads going to Wall st jobs. That says something. I am in STEM, fondest memories of Stanford were humanities, but long ago (70's). Good people at both, edge to Stanford.

19.<<<mamaedefamilia>>>
Congratulations on your acceptances! Academics are going to be superlative at both. I am going to speak broadly to location and quality of life issues.

Do you prefer urban or suburban/rural? Boston is very dense and public transportation can get you anywhere within the city and points beyond. It is relatively easy to access the eastern seaboard of the US by train. Stanford is more suburban. Public transportation can get you to San Francisco and the airport (about an hour away). If you like the outdoors, there are hiking and biking trails within an easy distance of the Stanford campus

Stanford campus is large and sprawling; Harvard is more compact

Travel: have you looked at the time and money involved in traveling from your home country? Depending on where you live, it might be easier to travel to one coast vs. the other with respect to plane changes and layovers.

Both schools draw diverse regional populations from all over the US and internationally.

Is the $5,000 per year difference meaningful for your family?

Best of luck and do let us know what you decide.

20.<<<TiggerDad>>>
Harvard has a bigger name at my native country, too, and if there is a direct correlation between the bigger name brand AND your career, then you should go with that for practical purposes. If there's no direct correlation, then it's a toss up.

21.<<<dongrae>>>
Both are amazing schools, you won't regret whatever school you choose.

22.<<<gr8pl8>>>
Ten, five or even three years ago it would have been Harvard. Now looking at the progressive way technology is changing our daily lives and is affecting the lives of people that don't even know it is affecting them, Stanford would be a great choice. Either choice will be great and can't go wrong. Choose Harvard because someone we know has been waitlisted at Stanford...lol.

23.<<<websensation>>>
It makes so much difference how the weather was when you visit the campus. When we visited Harvard campus, weather was gloomy, cold with slushy snow, with many tourists going around and impeding my hoped for slow in-take of 400 years of history and contemplation. I couldn't even touch the feet of that FAMOUS statute -- DARN IT! -- due to tourists milling about the statute. I had to stand in cold for 15 minutes if I wanted to get a iPhone shot of me and my kid standing next to that famous statute with stupid grins on our faces. Alas, the only souvenir we could get was some red Harvard hoodie from their student store.

Harvard campus definitely went down in our estimation after the visit from the image created in my brain from watching the Love Story movie, whereas Stanford kinda stayed the same. I personally prefer the old East coast 300 years old type of buildings but . . . . I personally prefer Cornell campus over Stanford campus but Stanford campus was very good also: I could have rolled my body around and around on that sun-drenched lawns across the campus and that would have taken all day. Even though there were many tourists, since the campus was so big, they were less noticeable.

24.<<<sushiritto>>>
The Stanford campus is 8,000 acres and gorgeous, mall next door with rolling hills made for running and bike riding. Different architecture than Harvard, but no less beautiful. Boston is a big city. Stanford/Palo Alto is a suburb between San Francisco and San Jose.

Tough decision and wish you the best of luck.

25.<<<dongrae>>>
Choose whatever school your heart goes on, my d chose Stanford over Harvard and MIT. Whatever school you choose, it won't be wrong.

26.<<<websensation>>>
My kid didn't even apply to Harvard after getting into Stanford REA mainly to avoid this kind of tough choice. If he wanted to attend Harvard, he would have applied Harvard Early Decision. I would make my choice based on whether I prefer the East coast style of life or the West coast style of life. Or just flip a coin.

I just saw this thread's name and realized it's an issue I'll never have (lol). My honest opinion is Stanford for STEM and Harvard for humanities. I would choose Stanford if it was up to me. But it's honestly up to personal preference because both schools are absolutely amazing.

29.<<<websensation>>>
JamesVanC must have gotten denied by Stanford. lol I got rejected by Harvard but I still have a high opinion of Harvard.

30.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
It all comes down to fit. Two kids (my D, included) from my D's school had that choice (and a few other choices) to make. One chose Stanford, the other Harvard. Another kid in the same class chose Princeton over Harvard.

There are no bad choices here.

31.<<<EquestrianCEO>>>
Silicon Valley- innovation, entrepreneurship, tech. Very "California", more lively and futuristic as @Chrchill said.

If you're interested in econ/business, I'd say Stanford is the way to go :) You'll be surrounded by opportunities in the bay area.

32.<<<thehalalpaki>>>
harvard

33.<<<DadTwoGirls>>>
For STEM except for straight Math this would be a no-brainer, Stanford wins big. For Math both are excellent and very similarly ranked. For other subjects they are both excellent and as @LoveTheBard says "There are no bad choices here". I also agree with his statement "It all comes down to fit". I haven't looked at either school's offerings in the subjects that you want to study.

The weather in Boston (or Cambridge, just across the river) varies enormously. There is a saying "if you don't like the weather in Boston, wait a minute". Some days will be beautiful, some will be cold and rainy with strong winds. Summers will get hot with a lot of sun but some storms. There is something we call a "northeaster" here where a low pressure system is centered just off shore so that the eastern part of the low can draw moisture from the gulf stream while the western part of the storm deposits that moisture on the citizens of Boston, with a lot of wind as well. Winters are mild by my standards, but I grew up about 300 miles to the north of here. It can rain at Stanford, but compared to Boston there is hardly any weather in Stanford, mostly a lot of warm (rarely hot) sunny days. Occasionally Stanford will have a drought and go for a few years without any rain at all. Occasionally Massachusetts will have a drought and go for a few weeks with only an occasional thunderstorm. There is probably more outdoor activity at Stanford if only because the weather is so much more conducive to being outside.

Stanford is close to a small town (Palo Alto). Harvard is close to a city (Boston). In terms of things like bars and restaurants Harvard has the edge, although we are quite strict about enforcing the drinking age here in Massachusetts so in terms of bars both might be a complete "nothing". As one example when my 22 year old daughter goes out to dinner with us if she orders a glass of wine they *always* check her ID (even when the waitress was a good friend of hers who had recently attended her 22nd birthday party).

Personally I have thought of Stanford as more welcoming, but this might be a matter of personal experience. I have met more pretentious students at or graduates from Harvard compared to Stanford. I don't recall this being an issue at all when I was at Stanford. In terms of "the students value their academics" both are excellent.

34.<<<Penn95>>>
Humanities: Harvard probably has slight edge.
Social and Natural sciences: there is no difference.
Engineering/tech: Stanford has a very big edge.
Weather: Stanford wins
Sports: Stanford wins
Campus: Stanford is way more gorgeous, but Harvard is in the city

35.<<<Data10>>>
One important consideration that is often ignored in such discussions is where you'd prefer to live/work after graduation. Stanford is in Silicon Valley and many key SV companies were founded by Stanford alumni/students and have related networking/internship connections, strong presence in job fair, including smaller startups. I grew up in upstate NY. I currently live in CA, largely because of the large presence at Stanford job fairs, and because I enjoyed the CA area while at Stanford. If you want to live/work/internship in the SV or CA area, Stanford has a strong edge. Similarly, the Boston/Cambridge area has a strong college presence and a large number of area companies with special network/internship areas. If you want to live/work/internship in Boston or the general area of the northeast, or want to work within IB/Wall Street, Harvard has a strong edge.

Another important difference that has not been well discussed are the difference in majors and degree programs, in particular Stanford's greater opportunities for interdisciplinary type studies and combined degrees. 2 of the 4 most common majors at Stanford are the interdisciplinary majors Human Biology and STS. The remaining two are CS/engineering fields in which ~40% of students pursue at co-terminal masters, which involves simultaneously pursuing a BS and MS, and some do CS+X as well which is an interdisciplinary combination of a CS and humanities major. I was in a program that was setup to foster tech entrepreneurship by combining a BS in engineering with Master's in engineering and business related fields. I doubt I would have done this type of program had I gone to most other colleges, and without it, I doubt I would have started a small Internet company. Harvard also has a good number of similar programs, but it's my impression that there are fewer opportunities that are pursued by a smaller portion of students.

As far as the programs in the majors themselves, they are almost all excellent and highly ranked, with great reputations at both Harvard and Stanford. However, one big difference is the percentage of students pursuing the relative majors. As touched on above, a much larger portion of students pursue tech majors at Stanford, particularly CS; and a much larger portion of students pursue social science majors at Harvard. This isn't necessarily good or bad, but different students have different preferences about size of intro classes/departments, portion of dorm members are in same/similar classes, etc. The time required to graduate for equivalent programs and number of opportunities to take out of major electives may also vary due to differences in DE/AP credit transfer. It's my impression, Stanford is more favorable. I was able to start with a year's worth of credits, allowing me to finish a BS+MS in slightly under 4 years.

36.<<<websensation>>>
@Penn95 I visited Stanford campus around 4 times, and I don't find Stanford campus all that beautiful. I mean, it's very nice but it doesn't have the variety of landscapes or buildings. I can understand why some say Stanford campus has that glorified Taco Bell look to it. The best location is that flowers garden spelling "S" and the church square area. I would say the campus is huge, nice and functional. Cornell, Wisconsin at Madison, Oxford -- now, those are beautiful campuses.

37.<<<Penn95>>>
@websensation Sure, it is rather subjective. Personally, I find Stanford the most striking campus in the US, followed by Princeton and Yale. But then again I like the uniformity of the architecture across campus and the fact that you feel like you are in a completely different world.

In general I think most people find the Stanford campus much more beautiful than the Harvard campus. I have never heard a person describe the Harvard campus as gorgeous.

38.<<<sushiritto>>>
[quote]In general I think most people find the Stanford campus much more beautiful than the Harvard campus. I have never heard a person describe the Harvard campus as gorgeous.[/quote]

I'm local to Stanford, so I'm biased. I run or bicycle the campus a lot and find some of the buildings on campus awe-inspiring. And then there's the golf course, the Lake Lagunita, the Dish, SLAC, etc. on the western side too. Harvard was OK. I also loved Princeton's campus. I'm sure there are more beautiful campuses, but between Harvard and Stanford, I agree with @Penn95 .

39.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@websensation - I have to disagree. I find Stanford's campus to be quite beautiful -- I like the Spanish style architecture, the many courtyards, outdoor sculptures, fountains and green spaces. It's very different than the traditional neo-Gothic style architecture of a Duke, or a Princeton, but it's not un-pretty.

In San Diego we have a beautiful park with Spanish-style architecture that was built to house the 1915 Panama-California Exposition. When my daughter took one look at the Stanford campus, her first reaction was "Wow -- I feel like I'd be living in Balboa Park!" She also thought that MemChu (Memorial Church) was so beautiful it makes one want to convert (she said the same about the Sainte-Chappelle church in Paris).

That said, some of the engineering and science buildings on the west side of campus near the Medical Center are not quite as attractive as those around the Main Quad or the Oval, but, overall, I think Stanford has a lovely campus. And, compared to UCSD, for example, it's paradise.

I can't comment on Harvard's campus one way or the other, but D decided that it was going to be too urban for her taste (Yale already had too many city streets running through it and she had heard that Harvard was even more urban than Yale).

As for DE/AP credits, D didn't fare quite as well, I'm afraid. No biggie, she's not in a rush to get out of there -- there are too many amazing classes she wants to take!

40.<<<Rivet2000>>>
lol, I find that I disagree with both @websensation and @LoveTheBard ...

First, I think that the Stanford campus is beautiful. The green spaces, gathering areas, and gardens all very pleasant. The ability to hike the Dish enables students to immediately change their surroundings. So disagree with @websensation and agree with @LoveTheBard.

Where I disagree with @LoveTheBard is when it comes to the engineering buildings (quad I assume) and Med center. I think that Stanford has done an excellent job in bridging original Spanish style architecture to a more modern look. They've managed that newer look while echoing the many of the features in original buildings: roof lines, color pallet, arches, etc. Well done.

41.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@Rivet2000 - I think I'll reserve further comment until I get to know that side of campus better. Right now, there's a lot of construction going on, and I only got to see those buildings either in a drive-by or from a distance. The first time was right before move-in when we took a wrong turn from the Cantor and started to see a lot more glass and metal and a lot less sandstone that we had remembered. My daughter started wondering if she had misremembered how pretty she thought the campus was; the second time D had a medical appointment and the buildings lacked charm in my view. Again, maybe I wasn't looking at the architecture in context or getting the overall gestalt.

I will say, however, that some of the other new construction (the Bing, the McMurtry Art building, etc.) are pretty cool looking, so perhaps they are doing something right on that campus architecturally speaking.

42.<<<TiggerDad>>>
I found Stanford to be quite beautiful and pleasant, definitely compared to Harvard. However, Stanford is beautiful in a hygienic and sanitary way, i.e., boring. The combination of balmy weather and the uniform Spanish architecture made me feel like I was in a sprawling sanatorium for the wealthy. Harvard, on the other hand, is ugly and disjointed yet with some character; certainly never boring. If someone were to offer me an all expense paid trip for a week to either, I'd choose Harvard without any hesitation.

43.<<<andsometimesY>>>
How did this thread get going again? The OP that started this thread was a supposed international student that hasnt been back since April 11th and shouldve already committed to and be attending one of these schools. Consequently, were just debating amongst ourselves. If this person does exist it would be nice to know where they finally attended and if any of the supporting arguments on here made a difference.

44.<<<sbballer>>>
Harvard architecture looks like it came out of the Preppy handbook circa 1970... Sperry docksiders, polo shirts.

now frankly a lot of the architecture looks outdated and backwards.

Stanford's architecture could use some variation and agree it can be too uniform.

However the quad and church along with the oval and mile long Palm drive are magnificent and definitely the center point for the campus. You will not find a grander entrance of any campus in America.

45.<<<websensation>>>
@LoveTheBard I agree Stanford campus is definitely not un-pretty; I just don't find the entire campus very beautiful. Yes, some parts of the campus is beautiful. I would give it a 7 out of 10, with Cornell and Oxford being 9 or 10. I just meant it lacks variation and reminds me of a grander version of Southern CA shopping center. Lol I admit that for those who are not familiar with Southern CA buildings, they might find the Stanford campus very beautiful. I have to say that SF architecture is very beautiful.

Overall, I would put UCLA campus on par with the Stanford campus. Stanford campus is better than all other UC campuses including Berkeley campus. I would rate Berkeley campus a 5. I would choose Harvard campus but only during summer, definitely not during winter. Stanford, given their land size, definitely could make their campus a lot better imo. Many dorms and cafeteria food should be better. Not saying they are bad at all; they could be better. Tressider Union definitely could be a lot better. The main library is beautiful though.

46.<<<websensation>>>
@Rivet2000 I agree with you regarding the engineering and medical building; I actually liked them a lot for the variety they offered. And they did not disrupt the flow imo. As for hiking in the Dish, I hiked there but did not find the area at all beautiful. The hikes near me are actually a lot prettier, where as the Dish hike trail felt like many small hills with horse hays. lol I then understood why they call Stanford the Farm. Frat houses leading up to the Dish hike trails looked very pretty to me.
