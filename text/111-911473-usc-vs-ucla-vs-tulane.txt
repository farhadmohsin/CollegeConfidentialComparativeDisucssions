1.<<<xxabii>>>
So I'm down to these 3 schools.

2.<<<xxabii>>>
Anyone? =\

3.<<<californication9>>>
hey im actually considering these 3 schools too!

out of the 3 i like ucla the best personally, but im out of state so it's different for me

im from ny and have zero interest in a ny state school because i dont wanna be with all nyers so if i was you i probably wouldnt consider ucla

usc is also a awesome school but what i dont like about it is that even though its in a city it feels so isolated. like i feel like u cant just walk off of campus and find something to do like you can at ucla

tulane is also a great school with a beautiful campus, my main reason for not considering it is b/c i dont wanna go to school with my brother lol
also when i visited everyone i talked to seemed to party everyday and werent really doing as well in school as they had been in hs

so i guess if i was you id go to usc or tulane...usc is ranked higher but tulanes honor program sounds good (im in it too!) and being guaranteed a scholarship each year is nice!

The most important question related to your undergraduate education is this:

Do your parents have the income to make sure that you have very little debt or none at all when you graduate?

If the answer is no, then, I wouldn't consider any of the three; I'd head directly to the nearest community college and enroll there instead, and try to get into a TAP if they have one, or generally an honors program.

As much as I'm about UCLA, I realize that future MDs have to be completely cognizant about their costs and debt because being in serious debt after a four-year degree would be fatal w/ med school ahead of them.

If the answer to the question above is a resounding "NO!," then I would go to the nearest community college, graduate from there, and reapply to the nearest UC near you and try to commute to school to save room and board.

One of the advantages of the smart pre-med rich-kids around UCLA's neighborhood is, they get to stay at the comforts of home, go to SMC or go straight to UCLA, then UCLA Med, and spend relatively little once they complete med school, despite their being rich. As one kid said, "I get to complete all eight years of my college education at institutions just a few miles/blocks from my home." Seems in a way wrong, but that's how life is sometimes.

If your parents have great cash flow even after planning for siblings' educations and paying the mortgage and planning to pay for your pre-med and medical educations, then let it fly with at whatever school you feel best and most comfortable, because you're going to spend most of your time studying.

The reason why I said you might want to commute is because you'll be prone to getting sick studying so much; I hope not, that you're in good health and stay that way.

UCLA has one of the most competitive pre-med programs in the nation, and typically leads the nation in applicants to med school, <a href="http://www.aamc.org/data/facts/applicantmatriculant/table2-race.htm" rel="nofollow">Table 2: Undergraduate Institutions Supplying Applicants to U.S. Medical Schools, by Applicant Race and Ethnicity - FACTS - AAMC</a>, so if competition scares you off, then don't consider going to school there.

Next, at whatever school(s) you attend, make sure you have a fall-back. Neuroscience sounds like a great major, but if you can sneak into an engineering program, and do the pre-med curriculum concurently or a little belatedly, that might be better option, employment-wise if med school falls out of the picture.

Anyway, I hope some of these ideas might help you out and best of luck at whatever school(s) you choose.

5.<<<vociferous>>>
UCLA the best and the cheapest (Tulane doesn't belong in the conversation IMO)

6.<<<fallenchemist>>>
vociferous - then you absolutely don't know much about Tulane. Why exactly would you say that? Because Tulane students are not at the same level academically? No, that cannot be it since Tulane students have average test scores moderately higher than UCLA and moderately lower than USC (well, identical ACT scores to USC actually). Add to that the OP is in the Tulane Honors Program, which is their top 10% of matriculants and have average stats that blow both USC and UCLA away. Because they are not as selective? No that cannot be it since they all have roughly the same acceptance rate. Because it is out in the sticks somewhere? No, it is in the most upscale part of town in one of the most unique cities in the world. Can't say that about USC.

Obviously you are welcome to your opinion. It would just be nice to know the basis for it.

To the OP - They are all great schools, clearly. You just need to decide which fits you better, since cost is roughly equal at all. UCLA is large and rather impersonal, and will definitely feel the effects of the California budget crisis. USC is bigger than Tulane, has a great sports scene, and has a lot of plusses. It is not in the nicest part of LA by any means though. You are at that stage where you just have to go with your gut. There really is no factor we can tell you without knowing a lot more about you. Certainly if you have questions about Tulane, PM me and I will answer them as honestly and objectively as I can.

7.<<<vociferous>>>
UCLA is a top 5 public and the most applied to school in the country. Tulane is a fine institution with some fine programs, but overall there is no comparison. How many Tulane Ph.Ds are teaching in major universities around the country? I would say its not 1/10 of the number that are out of UCLA. Although in that regard USC and Tulane might be pretty even. Again Tulane is a great place, but its not on par with UCLA.

8.<<<fallenchemist>>>
That is comparing grad schools. On that basis LAC's would never be in the picture. We are talking undergrad. As one who has done both, I can absolutely tell you that is apples and oranges. However, if you were to look at Ph.D.'s teaching at the university level now I bet UCLA beats Tulane 20:1 at least. But that has nothing to do with the OP's decision, he is not going for a Ph.D. And the quality of the grad school has little to do with the quality of the undergraduate experience. I could even make an argument for a negative correlation, because high powered grad programs often mean more undergrad classes taught by TA's, profs that are too busy for undergrads, harder for undergrads to do research, and other factors. That may or may not be the case at UCLA, but it does go to show that talking about Ph.D. programs at the least has nothing to do with choosing an undergrad school.

9.<<<vociferous>>>
"I could even make an argument for a negative correlation, because high powered grad programs often mean more undergrad classes taught by TA's, profs that are too busy for undergrads, harder for undergrads to do research, and other factors."

This is highly relative and quite frankly I would put some of the TA's at these places up against some of the burnout Profs I have observed at "teaching" schools. They are more cutting edge and really care about their students. But again, its relative.

10.<<<fallenchemist>>>
No argument there. I have seen very talented TA's and very awful professors when it comes to teaching. But since that is very iffy and random, it still has nothing to do with comparing Tulane to UCLA other than I can almost guarantee that 95 out of 100 students and parents want professors teaching the courses, not TA's. Tulane, even though they do certainly have Ph.D. programs and therefore grad students in many areas, have 100% of classes taught by regular faculty, which in Tulane's case means either tenure track professors, visiting professors, or what they call Professors of Practice, which is someone like James Carville who has taught a Poli Sci course at Tulane and I believe is scheduled to again.

Bottom line, if the OP had asked which school was better for getting a Ph.D., with the exception of a handful of particular subjects it would be UCLA. For undergrad, it is far more about what environment the OP is looking for, since these schools are academically similar on the whole yet otherwise quite different.

11.<<<KY Crusader 75>>>
Where do you think you'd achieve the best "fit"? That will give you your answer when you are comparing schools that are pretty much on the same level academically. UCLA is 94% Californians, so you might ask if that would make you more comfortable or if you'd rather follow a different path at Tulane where only 35% of the students are from Louisiana--and presumably just a few percent from California. As you say--you'd have a hard time getting away from your HS classmates at UCLA.

As I help my daughter look at colleges, the TA issue is a big factor for me. I can't understand why someone would want to sit in a huge class and be taught by a 25 year old, instead of in a small class and be taught by an experienced PHD--but to each his own.

12.<<<fallenchemist>>>
Totally agree with you KY Crusader. Just a minor clarification. The percentage of full time undergraduate Louisiana students at Tulane is just a hair under 16%, not 35%. Here is the link:

<a href="http://www.tulane.edu/~registra/archive/figs/ensu/093/enftf093.shtml" rel="nofollow">2009 Fall First Time Freshmen Profile</a>

While this is for freshmen only, the previous year was almost identical and the year before that just slightly higher. I could not find the stats for this year's senior class, but they wouldn't vary enough to change it. So at most about 18% of the full time students are from Louisiana.

Just strengthens your point, actually. The higher percentage comes from counting the School of Continuing Studies enrollment, which is virtually all Louisiana because that is the night/weekend school. The typical freshman hardly ever interacts with people attending these classes (not that it would be a bad thing! Just the reality) since they live in their own homes, not on campus and attend in the off hours out of neccessity.

It is confusing. Tulane shows undergraduate enrollment at 7200, which I couldn't figure out at first sine the incoming classes are about 1500. The difference is, of course, these part time students. Just a little nugget to clarify things. In fact, Tulane has more students from 500+ miles away than any other US university, apparently.

13.<<<juillet>>>
Also, the number of PhDs that are teaching in major universities around the country is directly proportional to the number of PhDs they actually turn out. UCLA has a huge graduate population (over 13,000) whereas Tulane's is much smaller (just under 5,000).

Are those total costs, or per year costs? If those are total costs with loans factored in I say you can't go wrong with any of them, and in that case you should select based upon your heart. If those are just what your family would have to pay out of pocket I say recalculate based upon what your loan burden will be in addition to what your family will pay out of pocket and compare that. (In the unlikely event that those are per year costs, I say scrap them all.)

Personally I'd eliminate USC (it's not the cost, it's just the school itself - something I don't like about it, although it does have great majors including Health and Humanity and select between UCLA and Tulane. Being an East Coaster with a familiarity with New Orleans and the South I'd be partial to Tulane, also in some part because it's smaller - still bigger than my it-got-too-small-by-junior-year LAC, but still small enough to warrant some attention and development and the feeling of a somewhat cozy campus. But honestly, part of me really wanted to experience huge-university life and all the resources and advantages that come with that. So honestly, I think fit and feel is going to be the determining factor here.

<hr>

I know your reply is based on vociferous post. But lets be fair here: UCLA accepts people based more on class rank and gpa, or as a UCLA administrator stated, how the student best performs in his/her classes at his/her high school. And surely test scores are a large consideration.

Someone from an underperforming high school could be admitted with a 3.8/3.8 unweighted/weighted gpa -- the u-w gpa being approximately the same because some high schools dont have much or any AP -- along with an 1,800 SAT score. UCLA is first and foremost a public school that needs to be true to its land charter and educate the poor as well as rich.

Just because Tully and USC can cherry-pick those kids with middling class standing but have families with the funds to acquire tutors to coach them up 300+ points on the SAT, doesnt mean that higher test scores are in anyway reflective of how good a student is at least potentially. Besides UCLA has a building specifically there to help these disadvantaged students obtain that potential, and many of these students do attend med school.

Per your apples and oranges statement earlier, which would apply to you, why dont you research what Tulanes placement into med school is? And assuming the originating poster wants to attend med school near home, how good Tulanes placement is into CA med schools?

UCLA, because of its budget concerns is trying to increase its profile of out-of-state students and internationals, who pay full tuition. Neither Cal nor UCLA will have problems in this regard. So that 94% from CA stat wont be true for this frosh class, with maybe at or around 20% non-Californians. People tend to create pathways around residency laws, and that 94% was probably never nearly right in the first place.

Per your second paragraph, at UCLA it is sink or swim. But I would think the research ops at UCLA would be greater than those at Tulane. Just as being at a large school of 26k-undergrds like UCLA will have its disadvantages, it will certainly have its advantages too for those extremely motivated self-starters.

15.<<<drax12>>>
Why would you assume that your liking New Orleans would translate to the originating poster?

To some it is a vibrant city, but to others it's just a dirty, run-down mess (not my thoughts).

Yeah, we have romantic notions of the city, with its jazz clubs on Bourbon Street, but that's a small area; many people will get its fill within weeks/months.

The great thing about LA is you can go west down Sunset to teh beach, or east on that same boulevard to the all the clubs on the three boulevards, athough I wouldn't take Sunset for either.

But regardless, a premed major will probably be locked in his/her room perpetulally studying, so the sights and experiences of each of these cities may never be visited by said poster.

This is why I recommended a re-evaluation of his/her plans and go local; certainly because of the costs as you mentioned.

16.<<<DunninLA>>>
with regard to UCLA's and Berkeley's CA resident %:

The real question is, I assume, cultural diversity. Why do we care where the students hail from? We are looking for a diversity of opinion, culture, race, religion, ethnicity, when we ask that question.

Because California is a melting pot of cultures (e.g. Los Angeles County lost its white plurality some 15-20 years ago), the IN-STATE students at UCLA and Berkeley are more diverse than schools that are georgraphically diverse (by student home state). California geographic diversity is global more than US -- most countries in Asia (including India), most countries in Latin America, lots of eastern Europe, etc. Thus, you find that the combined Asian and Latin American/Latino populations at UCLA and Berkeley top 50%... bringing with them their foods, religions, views on family roles, connections with their native countries, etc.

Beyond that, most CA-resident students at both these schools have parents or grandparents NOT born and raised in CA. CA's real population boom started in the mid 1930s when Texas, Oklahoma and neighboring states suffered a multi-year drought smack in the middle of the Depression. There are very few 4rd generation Californians, and few 3rd generation, so I'm not sure what it even means culturally to say a person is a "native Californian".

The CA in-state issue really is an irrelevant one if your concern is diversity.

17.<<<fallenchemist>>>
drax - you are very funny. My apples and oranges statement was clearly directed strictly towards being an undergraduate and being a graduate student. As far as your test score vs. gpa/class rank comparison, at least the test scores are on an exam that is standardized for everyone. High schools vary quite a bit in their grading and policies from state to state or even high school to high school. That whole matter can easily be argued both ways, but it is a very facile argument on your part to suggest that the reason Tulane test scores are higher than UCLA's is because of coaching. You cannot possibly have any proof of that. If you want to promote UCLA (which you really don't need to) or run down Tulane and USC (which is classless and ridiculous), at least don't do it with baseless assertions.

I certainly wouldn't even know where to research Tulane's placement into CA med schools, although there is no basis for assuming that the OP wants to go to med school in CA in particular. Most people are happy just to get in. But I do know Tulane's success rate for med school placement in general is very very good, and among Honor's Program student's nearly 100%. Your comments about New Orleans show that you obviously know very little about the city and even less about Tulane's involvement with it.

You really would be better off sticking to talking about the good points regarding UCLA and not talking at all about schools you clearly know little about.

18.<<<fallenchemist>>>
DunninLA - I largely agree that the diversity issue is mostly about ethnic diversity. However, one should not ignore regional diversity as well. People from Maine really do grow up with a different experience than those from Missouri, which are different than those from Colorado, which are different than...well you get the idea. Both kinds are good if you can get it.

19.<<<drax12>>>
as you stated in quotes:

"drax - you are very funny. My apples and oranges statement was clearly directed strictly towards being an undergraduate and being a graduate student."

But you violated that tenet yourself by referring to apples-and- oranges situations yourself.

Besides, why couldn't he have meant those UCLA undergrads attending grad schools for their PHDs?

"As far as your test score vs. gpa/class rank comparison, at least the test scores are on an exam that is standardized for everyone."

It's a point of fact that wealthier kids can be coached up through SAT prep schools, or if they're more wealthy, by private tutors. As one administrator put it, "the SAT is no longer a standardized test because there is a very high correlation between wealth and higher scores."

"High schools vary quite a bit in their grading and policies from state to state or even high school to high school."

Undoubtedly...

But at least with gpa and class rank, the latter is probably most important to UCLA, these represent a prolonged achievement rather than a one-shot ephemeral one over a few months of cramming.


"...but it is a very facile argument on your part to suggest that the reason Tulane test scores are higher than UCLA's is because of coaching."

I'm just going on Tulane's private-school status, associating that with wealth.


"If you want to promote UCLA (which you really don't need to) or run down Tulane and USC (which is classless and ridiculous), at least don't do it with baseless assertions."

Typical...

You run down UCLA to promote Tulane, and you accuse me of the like wrt your school. You're so blind with rage, you fail to see this.

The only thing I said or inferred was that UCLA is bound by charter to accept those from a certain (generally, top 10% rank), but those from USC and Tulane, being private, aren't restricted by such.

Are you going to tell me that Tulane doesn't dip into the second and maybe third quintiles of high-school classes?

And why is this so offensive to you? There should be college spaces for those who graduate lower in their high-school classes.

"I certainly wouldn't even know where to research Tulane's placement into CA med schools, although there is no basis for assuming that the OP wants to go to med school in CA in particular."

The originating poster is from NorCal, I believe. Yeah, I was projecting a bit, but, would this be wrong based on CA med-school spots are among the nation's most prized?

"Most people are happy just to get in."

Undoubtedly....

Most UCLA grads will be attending med school outside of CA, and maybe some on foreign soil.

"But I do know Tulane's success rate for med school placement in general is very very good, and among Honor's Program student's nearly 100%."

Big whoop, and I did intend to mock on this one...

Heck, if we took the top 10% of the 737 UCLA applicants to med school from 09, I'd say that there was 100% acceptance from that set also.

"Your comments about New Orleans show that you obviously know very little about the city and even less about Tulane's involvement with it."

Yeah, there are plenty of people who swear by New Orleans, and I congratulate Tulane for helping rebuild and improve the city, etc.

Where did I denigrate the city? ...besides it being small or at least smaller in comparison to LA?

"You really would be better off sticking to talking about the good points regarding UCLA and not talking at all about schools you clearly know little about."

Likewise...

20.<<<fallenchemist>>>
I have no idea what half of what you said even means. What apples and oranges did I do? Also, 3/4 of the Tulane students are on FA of some amount or another. You are making generalizations without having specific knowledge. And btw, Tulane accepts all Louisiana high school grads that meet a certain criteria, but it is hard to compare to UCLA's. However, it is a 28 ACT and a 3.5 GPA, so hardly cherry picking the very top. Again, you have no idea what you are talking about. You just assume things because they are private.

Oh, and he couldn't have meant those UCLA undergrads that went elsewhere for their Ph.D.'s because no one tracks that kind of thing. When you see a professor's pedigree, often they only state where they got their Ph.D. And besides, as was pointed out, it would be meaningless anyway because UCLA is just so much larger.

You show me one quote where I ran down UCLA. You cannot. About the closest thing I said that could be construed that way is that it is rather impersonal, and many many UCLA posters have said the same thing. All large schools are to some degree. I didn't say very impersonal.

I am blind with rage?? That is hysterical. You really are something else. I won't debate this with you any longer. Anyone that speaks reasonable English can read our posts and decide for themselves who is more coherent and logical.

One more thing before I depart:

Try to keep up. The reason that made perfect sense is that the OP already stated he was in the Tulane Honors Program. That isn't the top 10% of med school applicants, it is the top 10% of Tulane students. Therefore his chances of getting into med school if he chooses Tulane, based on past performance of HP students applying to med school, are extremely high, including into CA med schools. If you can't keep track of the facts, don't get involved in the discussion.

I'm sorry I portrayed you as such, 'blind with rage'; I just thought I noticed a bellicose tone in answering vociferous' post, and equally for which I thought I noted in your response to mine.

You seem like someone who is enamored of Tulane, and your defense of the school -- though I didn't think was needed in your original tone -- shows forth. This ardor is a good thing, and I hope you don't lose it.

I was just hoping that the originator of this thread does show up to read the thead to see if we might have helped him or her in some ideas in how to approach his or her college decisions, despite your and my tiff.

I still stick by my advice of him or her attending a community college to save money becuase debt at the end of college is a killer, with med school's debt looming in the future. It would be a double whammy (and also assuming it is a $30-35k/year cost).

Take care...

25.<<<drax12>>>
... the subtle thing is, it sounds like you're already handing him/her his/her degree.

In other words, "if you come to Tulane, and since you're in the honors program, I guarantee you a spot in medical school."

I'm sure there are very precise and very high performance standards to being in this program, and people fall out of it quite often.

THe person's individual initiative will determine if he or she stays in the program and is subsequently admitted to med school.

Take care...

PS - Truly, truthfully, duly noted on the quote-thing

26.<<<JTulaneD>>>
I'm from the west and also applied to the UC system (specifically UCLA, UCSF, UW, UO etc.) and I chose Tulane.

I am very happy about my decision. USC is in a very very rough part of town and UCLA is half beauty half cement.


While UCLA may look good on paper, I found my visit to be lost with the droning footsteps of 30,000 other people. If you want a big school go UCLA but if you want to make the connections with important people and have the chance to stick out... go roll wave. :D

27.<<<fallenchemist>>>
drax12 - I appreciate the more congenial tone. As far as the honors thing, I suppose it is a bit of a circular argument. Not quite, but I don't know what to call it. The reason I say that is that it isn't being in the Honors Program at the start that ultimately counts, it is being there in the end. And to stay in, you have to maintain at least a 3.6 (magna cum laude level). So as you can imagine, there is a very high percentage of that group that get into med schools, law schools, etc. if that is what they want. Now it is also true that there is a very high percentage that start out in the program that stay in, and others earn their way in. So my statement is still consistent, but no I am not trying to say he has a guaranteed spot in med school. I am saying that if he maintains his grades to the point where he stays in the program, his chances are obviously good. This really isn't a surprise since the students going in were extremely bright to begin with, even compared to just "normally bright" students, lol.

As far as the community college suggestion, I suspect he won't consider it, but it is an option for sure, especially if money an issue. He never did come back to clarify that, did he? If it isn't an issue, then going straight to 4 year school probably makes more sense, I think.

28.<<<alamemom>>>
JTulaneD, I am curious about this statement:
[quote]I'm from the west and also applied to the UC system (specifically UCLA, <b>UCSF</b>, UW, UO etc.) and I chose Tulane.[/quote]
Did you actually apply to the UCs listed? The reason I ask is because your posts indicate you are an undergraduate, and UCSF is a graduate-studies-only campus and does not accept applications from freshman applicants. Are you saying you applied to the listed schools for graduate studies?

29.<<<xxabii>>>
Thanks for everyone's input. First of, I'm a she, not a he. Lol. Just for clarification. Secondly, while financially going to a 4-year institution is a huge burden for my family, my parents insist that I do not go to community college, so that is out of the question.

I'm kinda confused as to what stance people have on these universities as majority of the thread is argument...not to be rude or anything, just merely pointing it out.

I also just received my acceptance to U of Delaware Honors Program, and my scholarship will be coming in the mail shortly, so based on how much they give me, it will definitely be a school I consider.

Does anyone know about UDel, a public school, in comparison with UCLA?

30.<<<alamemom>>>
Were you accepted to USC's Thematic Option?

31.<<<fallenchemist>>>
xxabii - LOL, sorry about both the gender mix-up and the arguments. But on the latter, if you cut through some of it and read them carefully, a lot of it does really relate to your situation regarding the "personalities" of the various schools. If that helps at all.

Certainly UCLA is far better known than UDel, but that probably shouldn't matter too much to you. But to try and compare two schools like that without a more specific question being asked is impossible. You really need to give people some specific factors to compare.

32.<<<alamemom>>>
xxabii - in addition to not listing things that would appeal to you in a university, you also list several schools in your threads : UCLA, UC Berkeley, USC, Tulane, Rochester, Drexel, U Delaware... Can you really not eliminate ANY of those at this late date?

A narrower list and more info on your preferences would be helpful.

33.<<<drax12>>>
I did refer to you, the originating poster, as 'he or she,' and 'him or her.' ;)

So my community college recommendation is out, but it does sound like your parents will help you keep the debt low at the end of your first four-year educational stint. This is very important.

And as I stated before, UCLA in general, and especially UCLA premed is very compeitive. But if you can withstand this, and with research ops on hand, you may find the school your calling.

Then again, if there's one school tugging at your heart-strings, by all means go there. Best of luck...

34.<<<JTulaneD>>>
It was just a typo :) lose the C.

I applied to these schools undergrad

35.<<<xxabii>>>
Well as of now I have narrowed it down to UCLA, USC, and Tulane.
Both Rochester and Udel I have not received financial aid from so for now, I have eliminated them from my potential school list.

As for USC, I just applied to Thematic Option a few days ago as I missed the first two deadlines, and I won't hear back till after May 1st. Fortunately, because I am a Presidential Scholar, I have a good chance of getting it, or so admission says, even with a late application. I am also planning to submit my UCLA Honors application in the next few days, although I have heard that it is a waste of time.

Thanks for everyone's feedback. As for what I like in school, I'd prefer a smaller school, much less than LA and USC. Also, I don't want a crazy competitive enviroment but as a pre-med major, I do need a school with a rigorous undergraduate curriculum to stand out as an applicant for med school. I love New Orleans and LA, but the cons of both places is that in NO it's humid and the weather is much nicer in LA. Downside of LA is that I was very intent on going out of state, and many of my classmates are going to those schools too. Hope this helped.

I completely agree with ThisCouldBeHeaven that UCLA is so large that the chances of you seeing your high school friends is minimal and even if you do, so what? It will be overwhelmed by the number of new people you meet. I somewhat disagree with the last comment though. Sure, go to office hours. But the spirit of that comment was that you get to connect with your professors on a much more frequent and personal basis at a school like Tulane than one like UCLA. that really isn't a knock on UCLA. Heck, you get to connect with your professors more at an LAC than at Tulane. The smaller the school, the more this is true, usually. And Tulane is so very undergrad oriented. Go to the Tulane threads and read some of the comments about how much time the professors have spent, often with zero notice, with visiting applicants. Also note the comments about how happy all the students seem.

You are right that the weather in LA is tough to beat, but the heat and humidity of New Orleans is not true most of the school year. the first 30 days can be pretty warm, and the last week or so during finals in May. In between it is much more moderate, it even gets pretty chilly sometimes. And it rains a lot more in New Orleans, although you had some of that in LA this year, lol. But don't worry much about the heat, it won't be a factor 85% of the time.

It really does sound to me from what you say, "I'd prefer a smaller school" (=Tulane) added to the fact that you want strong pre-med preparation (=both) but you seem to want a new experience (=Tulane) that Tulane is the best choice for you. But only you can decide what intuitively feels best. Given that all of these will provide a great education and a great experience most likely, you really do have to go with your gut.

If you are accepted to Thematic Option at USC that might make it perfect for you. The classes are 9 - 24 students, and the atmosphere is much more discussion-based and collaboartive than competetive. TO writing classes include individual tutorials with your writing instructor. It is too bad your application was late and you won't know until after you have to commit. The reason they can not tell you yet is that they will wait until after May 1st to see if there is any space left after commitment deposits are received from students who applied by the priority date and are already accepted to TO.

You make some good points, fallen...

But the research ops at UCLA would probably be > Tulane's, if this is what the OP desired. Bigger school = more impersonal, but bigger school = greater opportunity for various avenues to add to one's resume' or application to med school.

But for those who need a more hands on approach, usually those from underrepresented backgounds educationally, there are those (mentors, tas) who'll able to assist the student 'even in organic chemistry' as one put it, to help the student succeed.

Well, I had two publications from undergrad research at Tulane, and both were in American Chemical Society journals, the leading publications in chemistry. Not sure how much better an undergrad research experience can be that that. My point is that as an undergrad, there is much less time for research than as a grad student. This shouldn't be a major factor in the decision because of that. In fact, at some major research universities, science undergrads have a tougher time getting to do research because the labs are full with the grad students. They are relegated to washing dishes or its equivalent. I am not saying UCLA is like this for chemistry or biology and related areas, just that it is true in other places.

Now grad school is the complete opposite. UCLA blows Tulane away for the level and diversity of research opportunities in the physical sciences. But that is not what were are talking about here. Tulane actually "depends' on undergrads doing research, especially in their junior and senior years. UCLA obviously does not.

41.<<<drax12>>>
There are excellent chances for undergrad research at UCLA, and not washing dishes. The person would have to be a star, but it sounds like this might be the case wrt the OP.

42.<<<fallenchemist>>>
That's good to know. UCLA's chemistry graduate program is one of the most highly thought of in the country, and Berkeley's might well be the best.

43.<<<drax12>>>
... that would shine forth on the undergrad program if that's what you're intimating by your statement.

Btw, do you know where I can find the syntax where I can nest links in my text instead of having them stand alone? I like doing that better than how I have been linking. I know this site is different from html which uses "&lt;" instead of brackets or "[" as is done here.

44.<<<fallenchemist>>>
No, actually there is no "halo effect" (that is the term for what you mean) from the grad program to the undergrad. In fact it is sometimes the opposite unfortunately. This I know quite well and I have to say is indisputable. The pressure of keeping up a large research team and writing grant proposals and publishing many papers, not to mention the ego that often infuses these professors that are vying for honors and recognition and big consulting $$, means that undergrads are often an annoyance to them and that TA's (grad students and post-docs) are often given that duty. Certainly any individual professor might be an exception, but in aggregate it is a true statement. Even if they are the nicest people in the world (and unfortunately many are not), world-class researchers just do not have the time, there are so many demands on them. Ah well.

Here is the list of codes, see if it helps you. <a href="http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/misc.php?do=bbcode" rel="nofollow">College Confidential - BB Code List</a>

... the "halo effect."

But the better grad progams would undoubtedly bring in better students, and this would seemingly show forth a halo effect, ;), on the undergrad program, as they TA them.

And as someone stated, this might bring forth more cutting-edge methodology in the classroom, which might lead to a more "with-it" group of undergrads.

Is it better to be taught, at least somewhat indirectly, by someone who's intently publishing and trying to break new ground in his/her field, or be taught by someone, more directly, who might even be going through the motions, tenured, maybe older, maybe set-in-his ways, etc. It might not be so cut and dried, wouldn't you think?

I know that besides publishing, Dr Cram at UCLA, Nobelist, who also did his undergrad at UCLA, would teach undergrad classes to keep himself grounded, etc.

I understand what you're saying, and big-headed academicians would be a problem anywhere, probably as you said, more so at research-based universities.

But what we're saying here may be moot, probably is, because the OP will probably major in something other than chem. Given the odds, it would seem that way, unless there's a post of hers I missed. And I don't know how we got on the whole chem thing, other than we know you're a chemist.

Anyway...

Thanks for the link.

46.<<<fallenchemist>>>
No problem about the link. And you are right, I use chemistry as an example because I know it well (although <b>was</b> a chemist is the more correct phrasing), but the physical sciences, and many other areas as well, are all pretty similar in this regard. BTW, Dr. Cram is exactly who I had in mind when I said there are individual exceptions. He is a great chemist and a very nice guy.

I understand none of this helps the OP. At this point it is just a discussion. In that spirit:

This is a tempting arguement that I knew you would make and I almost preempted it in my last post, but decided to wait and see if you made it. It is partly true, but mostly not, for the sole reason that grad students in the sciences go to a lot of classes themselves in the first couple of years, while trying to TA and do some research, and then are expected to spend at least 12 hours a day in the lab <b>besides</b> being a TA. It is a slave labor system, make no mistake about it. So they are stretched pretty thin too. However, many of them do love to teach and some are very good at it. I certainly won't deny that. But I still get back to the fact that no matter how poor a teacher a full professor may be and how good a grad student may be, people are paying big bucks for a university education and they want professors teaching as often as possible. That is just a reality.

As far as cutting edge methodology, that made me chuckle. There isn't a lot of cutting edge you can bring to freshman chem, Organic chem and PChem courses, they are pretty set with material that takes 2 semesters to cover and haven't really changed much in 40 years at least. The same would be true for intro classes in other science areas. I will grant you that a couple of courses senior year might benefit from being taught by a Dr. Cram or someone else of his caliber (more or less), but I wouldn't base an entire decision of where to attend undergrad on that. You would pick up the same course by attending UCLA for grad school.

Been there, done that with all the above. It always comes back to the same thing. There is the big school, high level research school experience like UCLA, and there is the smaller school, not so grad school/not-so-research oriented school like Tulane, at least not research in the same manner as UCLA. Just two different worlds, and people need to pick which one suits them best.

47.<<<drax12>>>
There were only so many directions one could take in arguing these points.

Thanks for clarifying your expertise in them. But if I may say so, you seem a bit jaded at least in the whole process, certainly of research, and of 'slave labor,' etc.

As you said:
[quote]There isn't a lot of cutting edge you can bring to freshman chem, Organic chem and PChem courses, they are pretty set with material that takes 2 semesters to cover and haven't really changed much in 40 years at least.[/quote]

I did say, '<i>more</i> cutting-edge methodology,' not complete, or such that these students would become master chemists as sophs. But better grad students might be able to convey some ideas, in at least a fresher approach, and would be closer to being peers of these students, which might help.

And the way you described the whole process of frosh chem, it didn't sound as though it really mattered if these underclassmen were taught by a TA or a prof, since these materials 'haven't really changed in the last 40 years.' Does this make sense?

What is it about a prof that might help these kids to learn better, material that is so basic that grad students would certainly know as much as him or her? I found from my experience that the question of being able to convey things across to me the student would be the instructor's knowlege of the materials at hand.

Or is your thrust that these profs are being paid for such; therefore they <i>must</i> teach, or should teach?

And later, it didn't sound like even as upperclassmen, that things would even matter much but 'for a couple courses,' even if they were be taught by Dr Cram.

Nonetheless, thanks for clarifying and giving your opinions. Maybe someone can learn some things from your posts about the whole process.

48.<<<fallenchemist>>>
Well, I am having trouble imagining <i>any</i> cutting edge methodology one could bring to these courses. But under your theory, they should only let grad students teach the courses, since they will always be "fresher" and closer to being peers of the students. For better or worse, there is an expectation that a professor that has finished his PhD and taught for some amount of time will be better, or at least more knowledgable, than a TA. There is a big difference between the material not substantially changing for a long time and being experienced in teaching it. A certain operation might be routine and unchanged for decades also, but I sure don't want a 2nd year med school student doing it. No matter how you slice it, I don't go to college <i>wanting</i> to be taught by TA's. It might be a reality in many cases, but it wouldn't be my <i>a priori</i> choice.

What I meant about the upperclass level courses is that most undergrads will only have time in their 4 year schedule to take one or two of these. They are great to take, but would I base a decision on where to go undergrad on that? No.

Oh, and I am not jaded at all. It is just the reality of the system, and has been for decades. The "slave labor" comment was just normal conversational hyperbole. There was one professor where I went that scheduled his group meetings on Monday nights for the express reason that he knew that otherwise the grad students would be watching Monday Night Football (there were no Sunday night or Thursday night games then). A minor but typical example of the mentality.

49.<<<drax12>>>
... Professors should lecture, and TAs should lead discussion and lead labs.
[quote]For better or worse, there is an expectation that a professor that has finished his PhD and taught for some amount of time will be better, or at least more knowledgable, than a TA.[/quote]

I don't doubt that's true for, say, a humanities class. Because no matter how much one studies Shakespeare's Sonnets, there's going to be something the prof doesn't know about and therefore the TA probably wouldn't either; or that the prof would know about and for which the TA wouldn't, say, some oblique reference to such-and-such stanza or passage. (Btw, no I wasn't an Engilsh major, a lot because of English 10 series.)

So someone can approach the prof and ask a question he/she wouldn't be able to answer. 'I'll have to get back to you on that one, later.'

I don't think it would be as critical as, say, a prof not knowing about something in chem, when a student has approached him/her about it.

But then as you say, chem frosh year would be so rudimentary, that one wouldn't expect a student to approach a TA or prof with a question that he/she wouldn't be able to answer. Most likely said student would approach the TA or prof with an even more rudimentary question than the level of the class with questions of understanding.

I think classes in the sciences tend to be more perfunctorily led exercises that could easily led by a TA if needed (of those science classes I did take, not much): A -> B -> C -> D, etc. This is why one has textbooks in the sciences, rather than a ton of books, all at the prof's discretion in the humanities, etc. And even then when papers are due, the student will reference many other books.

We always hear about, 'prof just teaches from a textbook." This wouldn't be said of a science prof for the most part because where else is he going to teach from unless it's research?

Go ahead an answer, and then maybe we can put our conversation to bed. I do like conversing with you, but for the sake of the OP, maybe we should end this.

Consider it ended. Nice chatting with you.
