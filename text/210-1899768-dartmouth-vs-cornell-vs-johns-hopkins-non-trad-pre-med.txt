Hey everyone,
I was blessed to be accepted into Dartmouth, Johns Hopkins, and Cornell. For Cornell, I was accepted into Biometry and Statistics in CALS (since Cornell CALS allegedly accepts by major). I want to do pre med, but I want to major (or double major) in either Economics or Computer Science. Can anyone shed light on any of these schools for this type of track. Grade Inflation/Deflation? Research/Internship Opportunities? Social Life? Prestige? Pre Med to Med School success rates?
btw…which of the colleges is the most prestigious (ik its a stupid question, but my parents seem to think this is important)

2.<<<ezbreezy8022>>>

3.<<<jw1112>>>
Generally Hopkins &gt; Cornell = Dartmouth for prestige. Hopkins is amazing for premed and has amazing opportunities for research. Dartmouth is probably the most grade inflated of the three and has a great undergrad econ program. Since you were accepted to Cornell CALS, I don’t think you can double major in computer science or economics there since those programs are in CAS or COE. I would go to Hopkins if you want to focus on premed or Dartmouth if you are really interested in premed+econ.

4.<<<xDFFmp3>>>
imo for general prestige it’s Dartmouth &gt; Cornell &gt; Johns Hopkins, but you should pick the school that fits you the best at this point. The differences in prestige are small.

5.<<<ezbreezy8022>>>
how tough would it be to major in Econ + CS and do pre med (while maintaining a high GPA)

6.<<<ezbreezy8022>>>
at darmouth @xDFFmp3 @jw1112

7.<<<Consolation>>>
I believe that Econ is a very competitive major at Dartmouth, since many go there hoping to find an IB job afterwards.
JHU always had the rep of being cut throat for pre-med.
At Cornell, the problem might be the difficulty of taking classes across schools and majors, or of transferring internally.
YMMV. You might want to contact the pre-med adviser’s  office at each school and ask some questions.

8.<<<jw1112>>>
According to usnews, Hopkins &gt; Dartmouth &gt; Cornell, although the differences are small and they are very similar in terms of prestige. Doing econ+CS+premed will be tough anywhere, but I don’t think Dartmouth would be significantly harder than other similar schools (unlike MIT or Caltech, which are known for grade deflation).

9.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
how tough would it be to major in Econ + CS and do pre med (while maintaining a high GPA)
&lt;&lt;&lt;
Why would you want to do this?
You’re already going to have to add all the premed prereqs to your primary major.
What will your primary major be?
Don’t trip yourself up by adding unnecessary classes if your goal is med school.  Med schools don’t care about double majors, etc.  They won’t give you a break if your GPA suffers due to extra classes.

10.<<<xDFFmp3>>>
US news rankings really don’t mean much at this level because 1) the rankings can be easily manipulated by the colleges 2) The rankings change every year. Prestige doesn’t really change that fast.

11.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Economics + pre-med should not be difficult to fit into your schedule.  CS + pre-med may or may not be difficult, depending on how many requirements the CS major has (engineering-based CS majors tend to have more non-CS science requirements, though some may overlap with pre-med courses).  Economics + CS + pre-med would likely be difficult to fit without overloading your schedule, which can make it harder to keep a high GPA.
Pick one primary major that you like well enough that you are likely to do well (earn A/A+ grades in), add the pre-med courses (earn A/A+ grades in those courses as well), and use whatever remaining elective space for desired courses in other areas of interest (earn A/A+ grades in these as well).

12.<<<Arwen1>>>
For whatever it’s worth, I’ve heard recurring stories over the past 10 years about how cutthroat and competitive Hopkins premed is.
One of my Hopkins undergrad friends said that some student posted a sign on a door saying that a science final had been rescheduled or relocated (forget which), when it actually hadn’t been.
Some people thrive under competition though, so it’s personal preference.

Isn’t that true of pre-med everywhere?  (also, biology majors at schools with lots of pre-meds would have this issue)

14.<<<Arwen1>>>
No, there’s huge variation in campus culture. Anecdotally Hopkins has always been an outlier. At my undergrad university, I genuinely felt like there was a spirit of collaboration or we-were-all-in-this-together. Sure you had some individual people who were noxious, but not a general culture.
I think something to consider would be grading systems at different schools. With schools with grade deflation or who hew really closely to a bell curve in the sciences to “weed out” people, it’s going to encourage anxiousness and competitiveness.

15.<<<ezbreezy8022>>>
@mom2collegekids
most likely im going to be a CS major, econ minor, with pre med (i want to do ibanking if not med school), What would be the school that i could do this and end up with the best opportunities/highest chance at getting a good GPA

@ezbreezy8022 Hopkins has severe grade deflation. Also Cornell is a bit grade-deflated too but nowhere near as bad as Hopkins. Grade inflation/deflation is a important consideration for pre-med student. GPA can literally make you or break you in med school admissions. Personally my first choice would be Dartmouth and second Cornell and I would then apply to Hopkins for med school.
All three schools are more or less similarly prestigious, probably Dartmouth and Cornell a bit more for undergrad because of the ivy league tag.  For medical school Hopkins is more prestigious.

18.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
GPA can break you for med school…even at a name-brand school.  A parent here on CC was shocked last year when her DD didn’t receive any interview invites with a 3.5 GPA and strong MCAT …she was at a top 5 school.

These mean nothing to you.  Students with poor/borderline stats don’t get in.  Students with strong stats, an appropriate app list, apply in June, and have good medically-related ECs will likely get in…no matter where they went to college.

19.<<<stevensPR>>>
I would go to the visitation days.  There is a lot of false hearsay on this thread alone.  Case in point @Penn95
Where on earth are you getting the deflation stats?  JHU’s average GPA across the campus is a 3.35.  Is that major grade deflation?  Is Cornell’s “nowhere near that bad”?  Where do you pull this stuff.
As for prestige, I would argue JHU over both (I chose Hopkins over Cornell but did not apply to Dartmouth). But that is subjective as well.

20.<<<stevensPR>>>
As for the competition part, see here:
https://blogs.hopkins-interactive.com/2016/2013/03/is-hopkins-cutthroat/
I can also attest students are pretty collaborative at Hopkins.  The “Hopkins is rampant with competitive premeds” is all spammed BS from the 80s and 90s that is still spread by ill-informed people today

21.<<<stevensPR>>>
You can compare average GPAs here for frats:
According to this, JHU’s average GPA across campus is now a 3.38:
https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/FSL/wp-content/uploads/sites/39/2015/07/Grade-Report-Spring-2015.pdf
Cornell’s is below:
https://dos.cornell.edu/sites/dos.cornell.edu/files/frat-sor/documents/Frat-GPA-Fall-2014-Final.pdf
https://dos.cornell.edu/sites/dos.cornell.edu/files/frat-sor/documents/Frat-GPA-Fall-2014-Final.pdf
They are both around a 3.35 for average GPA.  Hopkins’ GPA for sororities is actually HIGHER.  Nowhere near this “Hopkins has severe grade deflation. Also Cornell is a bit grade-deflated too but nowhere near as bad as Hopkins” alternative fact from @Penn95

22.<<<Penn95>>>
I was speaking specifically for pre-med not overall. The reputation of Hopkins being brutal for pre-med has for some reason persisted. Maybe it is not true as you say,  but I a far from the only one with this perception. Personally I have a few friends who did pre-med at Hopkins and they felt it was rather brutal. Also they food the physical environment rather stressful.
Cornel and Hopkins definitely are more grade deflated and rough than Dartmouth though. The advantage for Hopkins as a pre-med is that you could also get involved in some great research as an undergrad and boost your med school application.
As for the prestige point, definitely it is rather subjective, but for undergrad Hopkins has a lower yield rate (40.6%) than both Cornell (52.7%) and Dartmouth (51.4%) and tends to lose the cross admit battle with both. While this is not a perfect measure of prestige, it does reveal desirability to an extent. There is not a big actual different but Cornell and Dartmouth probably benefit because they are ivies.

23.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
Since you’re a JHU undergrad, can you share more about your perspective?  Are you premed?
we do hear that premed is a grind at JHU, but maybe it’s not worse than any other school.
Whether a school is known for grade deflation or grade inflations isn’t really relevant except if the student is premed.  Schools that have grade inflation still heavily weed the premed prereqs.

24.<<<stevensPR>>>
@penn95 you of all people coming from penn know that yield can be manipulated if hopkins were to take the same proportion of people ED (especially if they took more than 50% ala Penn). I too have friends that did pre-med (and are still there) at Hopkins as did my roommate, so I’d think being closer to the vest is more reputed than your third hand assertions.
Cornell selectivity is also not quite apples to apples since they have a CALS division.
What’s also clear is that Hopkins is enrolling more academically accomplished students (similar to what Northwestern began doing in the past) - while still maintaining yield, which makes the lower yield more impressive than Cornell or Dartmouth.  Hopkins also isn’t just taking high scorers with potential lower rank ala vandy (with 87% ranked in top 10%)
SATs of enrolled freshman:
Hopkins:
SAT (M+V old scale):1420 to 1570
Freshman in top 10%: 94%
Cornell:
SAT (M+V old scale):1330 to 1520
Freshman in top 10%: 90%

25.<<<stevensPR>>>
@Penn95 Again, show me Cornell is more grade deflated than Hopkins for premed based on facts and not alternative facts like your alumnus trump.

26.<<<monydad>>>
It’s funny, for a while, some years ago,  they were publishing average grades at different schools. Dartmouth’s average GPA was lower than Cornell’s. FWIW.
Who really knows where it’s tougher, if they haven’t been to the other schools.

27.<<<stevensPR>>>
@mom2collegekids
At the end of the day, premed comes down to tests that are curved.  My roommate went to tons of parties and still did well enough to get into Columbia med with a 3.7 GPA from Hopkins.  Some of it is intelligence - another is time management.  In no way are students going out of their way to not help one another.  People know Hopkins is tough - but this fosters camaraderie since people have the same common goal.  The acceptance rate to Harvard med is like 3% - do people have much to gain by not helping their fellow man when 2 minds are better than one? I personally was not premed, but I was 1 bio course and 1 orgo course away from being one, and I did fine.
The only people that complain and moan about premed at Hopkins are ones that did not go there or had a tough time collaborating (luckily these are in the far minority).

28.<<<Penn95>>>
@stevensPR
Overall yield can be manipulated, sure, but RD yield cannot. Btw Dartmouth nd Cornell accept a % of their class ED that is similar to Hopkins.
For the class of 2020:
Hopkins RD Yield: ~27.5%
Dartmouth RD yield: ~37%
Cornell RD yield: ~40.9%
(Penn RD yield: ~50%+, only since you mentioned Penn manipulating yield - it does but still has a high RD yield)
Saying that Hopkins admits more academically accomplished students is just not true.
Dartmouth SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020: (670+680) - (780+780)
Cornell SAT (V+M) middle range (old) class of 2020      : (650+680) - (750+780)
Comparison to Cornell is not apples to apples since Cornell has some non-tradiditonal program that attract students with lower scores. Even that small difference does not suggest a actual difference in student quality. As for Dartmouth, it has slightly higher stats on paper.
Also many top schools do not solely focus on scores and GPA, they dont mind admitting some special students who have created a company or have done something else out of the box but have lower stats.

29.<<<stevensPR>>>
@Penn95
You’re pulling the wrong SAT scores:
See here:
https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/cornell-university

30.<<<stevensPR>>>
@Penn95   Even from the range you’re citing, you can see Cornell’s SAT 25th range is 1330, far lower than Hopkins’ 1420.

31.<<<stevensPR>>>
@Penn95
And RD can definitely be manipulated via waitlists and greater student profile refinement - every school does modeling on applicant demographics and subcategory yields - Hopkins could do the same if they wanted but they have not.  Chicago’s significant yield increases with no ED dependency is not something that is organic.
What you haven’t shown is defacto data (even from an article that shows Hopkins would lose versus Cornell or Dartmouth (similar to a duke article a while back) and not some garbage database like parchment or outdated revealed preferences survey.  I can believe it loses significantly as would penn to HYPSM, but it is unclear if it does so with Cornell or dartmouth)

32.<<<Penn95>>>
Pulled the data directly from the cornell and dartmouth websites for the class of 2020. So i don’t think they are wrong.
Also the link you provided gives a range of 1390-1550 for Cornell. The verbal range provided is 650-750 and math is 680-780, which are the same as the Cornell website.

33.<<<stevensPR>>>
@Penn95
You’re not looking at the SAT before March 1, 2016 tab.  I would have expected more from a Wharton grad…=).  Regardless, how the 1330 to 1530 range suggests Hopkins (with a 1420 to 1570 range) is admitting and enrolling a more selective class.  Not sure how your argument holds water.

34.<<<Penn95>>>
@StevensPR RD yield cannot  be greatly  manipulated through waitlists. Also how are you so sure that Hopkins does not engage in student profile refinement as you call it? Every schools does that, but still this can only go so far. You cannot predict what choices an RD applicant will have and you cannot predict which applicants will for sure choose your school of admitted. Chicago’s yield has increased because it has managed to maintain a top 10 USNews spot for quite some time now, it is generally high ranked, and has revamped its undergrad to attract a wider audience. Still Chicago is a more niche place relative to the ivies so it tends to be a bit more self-selected.  RD yield is not at all as easily manipulated as you make it to be.
Why is Parchment garbage? It is not 100% accurate but they jut track revealed preference. there are no 100% accurate verifiable sources for these sort of things anyway.
The difference is RD yield between Hopkins and Cornell/Brown, the other Ivies is not due to the fact that these schools have some amazing yield protection techniques that somehow Hopkins doesn’t use.

35.<<<stevensPR>>>
See here:
http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/university-chicago/1557409-does-u-of-chicago-send-everyone-lots-of-unsolicited-mail-or-just-me.html
http://www.personalcollegeadmissions.com/getting-in/the-great-success-of-the-university-of-chicago
Chicago increased yield from 30% to 66% through effective marketing and more granular selective student admission.  It absolutely can be done.
Hopkins has not participated in the mass spam game aka Chicago or Vandy or Wustl.

36.<<<monydad>>>
re#29, so at Cornell it should be easier to get the needed grades, if your fellow students in curved pre-med classes are dumber. Thereby making it the best choice.

37.<<<Penn95>>>
@stevensPR  Oh but yes I am looking at that tab. Only thing is that you cannot simply add the math +verbal when given as separate ranges. this is why i rote down verbal and math separately  (I guess i paid attention to my stat class at Wharton after all…)
As I said before Cornell has a few schools that attract people with  in general lower SATs. If you took just the liberal arts, business and engineering students (leave out agriculture, hotel etc) then there would not be much of difference.
Besides, these differences in scores do not show a difference in academic accomplishment. any of these schools could have an entire class with perfect or new perfect scores.  Just means they are willing to admit non-traditional student that have something special but not top scores.
Example: Yale and Chicago have higher scores than Stanford. Does this mean that they admit more accomplished students? of course not. It is just that they focus is slightly different.

38.<<<stevensPR>>>
@penn95, there is a statistical difference between the following:
Cornell 25th percentiles vs Hopkins for Verbal: 650 Verbal vs 700.
Cornell 25th percentiles vs Hopkins for Verbal: 680 vs 720
Keep in mind those are enrolled stats, you’d see similar or greater disparities for the admitted students
ACT: 32 to 35 for Hopkins.  Cornell: 31 to 34.
Maybe you weren’t awake during your stats class.
As for Yale and Chicago versus Stanford:  Did you also forget that Stanford admits DI athletes?

39.<<<Penn95>>>
@stevensPR and you seem to keep ignoring that cornell cannot be directly compared to JHU because it has many different nontraditional schools?

40.<<<stevensPR>>>
@Penn95 and yet similar differences exist for Dartmouth and JHU at the 25th percentiles, what’s your point?

41.<<<stevensPR>>>
@penn95 And here you go, since you can’t seem to do the research yourself
https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/admissions/undergraduate/firstyear/class_profiles.cfm
Cornell engineering with higher scores than the other colleges within Cornell has an admit profile roughly equal to that of Hopkins’ enrolled profile (which includes the lower scoring Arts and Sciences division within Hopkins in addition to engineering).

42.<<<Penn95>>>
@stevensPR The small difference could very well be explained by Dartmouth’s stronger athletics, strong legacy tradition and the fact that it is probably be more willing to accept very unique candidates with something special but not super high scores. Such an applicant is more likely to apply/attend at an ivy+ school than Hopkins.
yet it still doesn’t mean that somehow Hopkins students are more academically accomplished.

43.<<<stevensPR>>>
@Penn95 Cool, more conjecture grounded in quicksand than fact

44.<<<Penn95>>>
@stevensPR Superior athletics and stronger legacy ties are facts not conjecture. As is the fact that unique applicants tend to flock more to ivy+ schools. Besides  what are your facts?  that 10-20 point differences in SAT scores make for a more academically accomplished student body? haha ok.

45.<<<stevensPR>>>
@penn95 or you know 50.  But hey, I’m not the one that slept during stats!

46.<<<Penn95>>>
@stevensPR We are talking about dartmouth here, not Cornell (Cornell can’t be directly compared, remember? ) Even if the difference is 30-40 points though it still doesn’t mean much out of context.  Different schools have different priorities and can afford to admit more unique student with lower stats.
You don’t seem to understand it do you? Focus on just scores does not mean a more accomplished student body. It means a school wants to accept more people with high scores to improve their rankings. Vandy does it, Hopkins does it. Other schools have no need to do that and are able to accept a more balanced student body.
Not saying that the student body at Dartmouth or Cornell is more accomplished than the one at Hopkins. But saying the opposite is also not true.

47.<<<ezbreezy8022>>>
wow lol @Penn95 @stevensPR
overall, which choice should i select if I want to major in CS, minor in Econ, and complete pre reqs with the most ease and highest chance of getting a high GPA. Which college would put me in a better place in terms of med school/Wall Street placement. I know it’s going to be a lot of work, but I’m willing to do that because I would like to enter finance if med school doesn’t work out. I would also like to select the school that can allow me to conduct research/join a few clubs and still have a solid social life.

48.<<<Penn95>>>
@ezbreezy8022  hahah i know we are both too stubborn 
Regarding med schools and wall street i personally believe Dartmouth is the best choice. For Wall Street Dartmouth has the biggest tradition and representation (%-wise) of the three and is in general targeted more by wall-street for recruiting.
Also in general it will be easier at Dartmouth to get a higher GPA (necessary for both med school and wall street recruiting) and it is also a less stressful, more intimate environment than the other two.
Both Dartmouth and Cornell have good social lives (people do have fun outside of studying) and the campuses are beautiful.
One plus i can think in favor of Hopkins is that it would provide you with research opportunities at one of the best medical schools/hospitals in the world, which could help your med school apps. You will have biomedical research opps at both Dartmouth and Cornell but more limited compared to JHU.
Overall i would personally go with Dartmouth.

49.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
Can we stop the #!*%-measuring contest and get back to the OP’s concerns?
@stevensPR What% of JHU frosh do you think are premed?

50.<<<stevensPR>>>
@ezbreezy8022 if your interest is wallstreet, go for Cornell due to proximity and placement.  If your interest is pre-med, go to hopkins.  Dartmouth for CS is a complete waste.  In terms of difficulty, GPA at Hopkins for CS/Econ would be easier than Cornell and harder than Dartmouth.

51.<<<stevensPR>>>
@mom2collegekids  I would wager 25% at JHU is premed, probably 33% enter as premed.  But similar to most colleges, some drop it due to changes in interest or lack of grades.  Still, a low GPA from Hopkins isn’t necessarily a killer since schools know its rigor.
https://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/even-with-a-very-low-gpa-3-3-dont-lose-hope.991724/

52.<<<stevensPR>>>
@mom2collegekids and this isn’t to say premed or Hopkins in general is heavily grade deflated (it’s not) - but rather there is no ridiculous grade inflation.  it is comparable to Cornell.

53.<<<CT1417>>>
@ezbreezy8022 – I will only respond to your question about where to major in CS at Cornell.  The CS major is offered in both the College of Arts & Sciences and the College of Engineering.  Econ is also housed in Arts & Science, so your best bet would be to transfer from Ag into A&S.  Transferring within colleges is relatively easy at Cornell, with the exception of Engineering and Architecture, Art & Planning (would be difficult to graduate on time).
Best of luck.

54.<<<stevensPR>>>
You can also see the med schools accepting 5 of more JHU students a year:
https://studentaffairs.jhu.edu/preprofadvising/pre-medhealth/medical-school-application-trends-outcomes/
You have the usual suspects of Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Columbia, Duke, UCSF etc etc.  This is more than some schools like Berkeley or UCLA (with way larger pre-med applicant pools) have:
http://career.ucla.edu/Portals/14/Documents/PDF/MedStats/2014_Medical_School_Admissions_Statistics.pdf_042516.pdf
In some cases, you don’t even have a single admit for Harvard or Stanford med from the entire UCLA student body.

@stevensPR
Historically, the “grade deflation” reputation  at Hopkins has been tied to the fact that they (as well as MIT) used to take pride in the “rigor” of their curriculum and promote the fact that grading freshman year needed to be pass fail so as to allow students to adjust to the harsher grading policy. (MIT has a freshman pass/fail grading policy as well).
More recently, Hopkins has has tried to shed their “cut-throat” reputation in an effort to broaden their appeal (and rise in the rankings), but until recently they were never willing to drop the pass/fail freshman grading as proof (which made some people skeptical).
Most recently, Hopkins voted to drop the freshman pass/fail grading policy (starting this fall). It will be interesting to see what happens going forward, but at a minimum, this makes it difficult to compare current average GPA’s with other schools.

[quote]
Johns Hopkins University adopted a covered grade policy in 1971 to help undergraduates transition into its rigorous academic environment, which at the time lacked many of the student services now available. The Academic Council, a faculty governance body for the faculties of arts and sciences and engineering, reassessed the policy in 2011 and voted to repeal it; the change was just recently announced as taking effect in the fall of 2017. Current undergraduates and those beginning in the fall will still receive covered grades for their first terms.
