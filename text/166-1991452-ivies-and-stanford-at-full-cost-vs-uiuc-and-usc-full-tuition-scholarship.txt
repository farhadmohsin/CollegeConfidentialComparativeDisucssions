My graduate has been accepted to a few of IVYs and Stanford but based on EFC calculator will receive no financial contribution from these schools.  Also accepted at UIUC and USC with full tuition scholarship.  We want the best education but finding it hard to pass up a full tuition scholarship.  Any thoughts appreciated.

2.<<<MA2012>>>
You should have financial aid offers already. Did you run NPC calculators last fall to check on needs based aid from Ivy’s/Stanford?  Full tuition is a nice offer.
Does your child have a major in mind?
USC is a good school. UIUC is very good for some majors.

3.<<<menloparkmom>>>
OP,
my DS was in the same situation a few years back. Got into Chicago, Dartmouth, Brown as well as some great LAC’s.
He chose USC , graduated with honors and was one of only 10 students who received Discovery Scholars 10K awards for grad school.
He just received his PhD from CalTech, the most prestigious grad U in the world, also at no cost.
His intention all along was to go to CT for grad school, and USC helped make that happen.
He never regretted going to USC. He found his “peeps” in the small Honors Science and Humanities classes, was able to do funded research all 4 years, and  he wants to go back to be a professor.
You graduate will be treated like Gold at USC.
And there is Nothing like being able to wear shorts and sandles all year long, lol!

4.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
What major?

5.<<<happymomof1>>>
Lots of students who can’t easily afford Stanford, etc. end up at their home-state Us, or at places that give them big merit scholarships every single year.  Don’t feel bad about this.  If UIUC and/or USC work better for your family, send your kid there and don’t look back.  Students with the capabilities to do well at Stanford, etc. can find their peer group wherever they land.

6.<<<mom_2022>>>
Economics.

7.<<<mom_2022>>>
Agree.  We are lucky to be able to pay for college but still trying to be practical.  Wondering if in the real world having a Harvard or Stanford degree is going to help him land a job.

8.<<<mom_2022>>>
Congratulations, you must be very proud!
USC business school is a top school just don’t know if a degree from Harvard or Stanford will open  up more opportunities for him.

9.<<<menloparkmom>>>
On the West Coast either a USC or Stanford degree will be equally helpful.
I say that because the Trojan Family Alumni net work is very strong in the west.
Harvard is Harvard, and a degree there is known everywhere.
But neither a Stanford or Harvard degree is worth $300000 more than a degree from USC.
If he is going to major in Economics then save the $$ for an MBA, or a MS in Economics.
Both will cost you a LOT.

10.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
For econ, I think USC and their network would beat UIUC so I would eliminate Illinois.
So it comes down to whether full-tuition scholarship at USC beats out being full-pay at Stanford/Harvard.
He can definitely get a job coming out of USC. That’s a pretty low bar. But Stanford and Harvard are still more target schools for some industries than USC. So it really depends on what he is aiming for, how much being full-pay would hurt, etc.

11.<<<mom_2022>>>
No financial assistance offered based on  EFC calculator.  He plans to major in CS or economics.

12.<<<privatebanker>>>
USC isn’t a good school. It’s a spectacular school. It is subjectively not as prestigious as Stanford or the Ivies.  For free it is like hitting a 300k scratch ticket.  Don’t throw the ticket out and pay 300k more to find another ticket.

13.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Also, that money, invested for 40 years with (fairly conservative) 5% real returns, will be about $2M by the time he retires.
So it really comes down to whether you have money to burn or not. If you have, say, 8 figure liquid net worth and he will inherit millions anyway, then sure, the quarter million or so difference in cost probably shouldn’t matter much to you.

14.<<<USCWolverine>>>
Firstly, congrats to your child for gaining asmission to so many excellent universities.
As to OP’s Q, that’s easy:  USC with that MAJOR scholie by a mile.  We only had a 12.9% acceptance rate this year.  Many SCions with amazing stats were denied.  USC is a fantastic school, and in every major.

15.<<<privatebanker>>>
Also as a small factoid. USC is #4 in the number of billionaires that have graduated from the school out of all schools in US.
That’s what I call real prestige.

16.<<<simba9>>>
I got my grad degree at USC and used to work at Stanford. I personally would pay about $10K-$15K per year extra to go to Stanford over USC.  If I’m getting $50K a year more from USC, it’s an easy decision.

17.<<<nollagam>>>
Even for the same price tag, there’s some compelling reasons to pick USC over Cornell, Dartmouth, and perhaps, also Brown.

18.<<<rocket88>>>
USC with full-tuition scholarship.  Easy choice.

19.<<<PeaceOfMind>>>
OP’s question is whether Stanford or Harvard would confer an advantage over USC or a top public ivy such as UIUC in terms of post graduation job prospects. I believe the answer is maybe in very few scenarios such as for investment banking and consulting and by firms such as Goldman Sachs and McKinsey which target a few schools for recruiting. A
nd maybe one can argue that Stanford’s proximity to Silicon Valley’s ecosystem would confer some advantage for graduates interested in tech start-ups. Yes, high tech firms recruit all over the country, but the informal ways to connect with venture capitalists, founders, etc. is undeniably richer in Silicon Valley.
Also, in some rare situations where the employer is a foreign country-backed (particularly China) organization looking for employees with internationally prestigious education credentials, Harvard and Stanford would offer an advantage by virtue of their reputation internationally.
These are all very rare situations.
For the majority of career fields, no there would not be meaningful difference.

20.<<<mom_2022>>>
I am interested to hear your reasons why USC over Harvard, Stanford or Duke.  TY.

21.<<<mom_2022>>>
So would you pick Stanford over Harvard for undergrad given location?

22.<<<PurpleTitan>>>

Alumni network is arguably stronger (or at least as strong).
Much cheaper.

I’ll put it this way: If my family had 8 figures net worth, I’d pick Stanford. If 200K is actually real money to me, then I’d take the big scholarship to USC and invest that 200K.

23.<<<mom_2022>>>
Unfortuantely not the case… We don’t want the choice to be only about cost after working so hard to get the chance to go to some elite schools.  But USC is a top school for business which makes this decision so difficult.

24.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
^What isn’t the case?
And your kid also worked very hard to earn that full-tuition scholarship to USC. It’s not like they hand those out like candy. Only a handful are given out by USC each year. Let me put it this way: There are fewer full-tuition merit scholarships given out by all the top 25 schools all added together than there are freshmen slots at any one of HYPSM.

25.<<<ewho>>>
Stanford does not have undergraduate business major. The closest one is MS & E. Some of the strongest kids switch to CS once they are in. And many will get internships at the top tech companies after 1st year.
If you initially planned or worked all the way to what you have now, maybe you should stay with your original plan.
Parents need to be able/willing/ready to pay to make it happen.

26.<<<privatebanker>>>
USC is elite. Honestly and politely  I am not sure how much more needs to be said.  2.2 million students per year in US plus thousands of international student apply to us schools each year.  If there are 40k spots in the top 25 for the US portion of the pool  that’s means only the top 18 percent get in. And now take out legacies athletes and urm it’s even a smaller pool. USC is in that pool.
The other big names definitely rank higher and have higher prestige among the people in the pool with them. But very few people care but the other people in the pool with you.
USC is 70k per year times four years.
They are giving you a free house.
He has earned the great reward. Enjoy it.

27.<<<CU123>>>
There is only one chance to go to Stanford or Harvard for undergrad school. but if you can’t afford it then…

28.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
^ Yeah, but

Life doesn’t end at undergrad. The fetishization of undergrad (vs. grad school or HS or anything else in life in your 20’s or later) by some on here is odd, to me.


I'm far from convinced that undergrad at Harvard/Stanford beats undergrad at USC + $200K (which, even with a fairly conservative estimated growth rate of 5% a year becomes $1.5M in 40 years).


29.<<<privatebanker>>>
@PurpleTitan couldn’t agree more
I will mention again and for  @CU123
USC has produced the 4th most billionaires of any US university   I don’t think Stanford or Harvard would have been worth it for them. Not even considering the full ride.  And their amount of alumni giving is mentioned in the press as astronomical compared to other schools
So if I was a football star and was offered a full ride I should say no and play football for Harvard or Stanford and pay them 73k a year after taxes for the privilege of doing so.  Just so I could impress my boss neighbor or someone at s cocktail party
If it were revenue neutral I would pick h or s of course.  But this whole conversation is silly.
He is smart enough to get s full ride and into h and s. He is smart enough to finish top of his class at usc and go to hbs or hms or Stanford law.
And can you think of a more pleasant climate

30.<<<ewho>>>
The OP said that at USC it is a full tuition scholarship , which translates into about $50,000/per year in saving…
Nothing pays 5% for 40 years and no gain is without being taxes. If this is true, OP, put another $200,000 aside on this investment and the problem is solved.
Your kid is smart enough to get this far, he/she should know what the right decision is.

31.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@ewho, actually, the stock market (S&P 500) has averaged 10% annual returns over the past 90 years. And over every 40 year period in that timeframe, the average annual compounded returns for a 40 year period have ranged from 8.9% to 12.5%. I picked 5% to be extremely conservative. And sure, you’d have to pay taxes. You have to pay taxes on anything. That still doesn’t change the fact that if you take $200K and let it compound instead of spending it, you’re going to end up with a ton of money. Millions. I don’t know about you, but I’d rather have millions and pay taxes on that than not have millions.
And certainly, if the OP has so much wealth that they just have another $200K (or multiple $200K’s) lying around that they could let compound, then why not splurge? Like I said, if you have 8 figures in liquid assets, feel free to do whatever you like with that money.

32.<<<ewho>>>
^ if it is this simple, everyone should borrow $200,000 at current 1-2% and hold at stock market for the next 40 years. It is actually even cheaper than 1-2% if you sell options to against the underlying securities.

33.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@ewho, please let me know who’s lending out for a 40Y term at 1-2% interest without need of collateral or other backing.
I would most definitely be interested in such an opportunity.

34.<<<USCWolverine>>>
I’m not familiar with UICI, but I’m sure it’s an excellent school.  That said, it’s been referred to as a “public ivy” in this thread.  Previously I’ve only heard of schools like Michigan, Cal, UCLA, and UVA referred to as public ivies, and rarely at that.  Perhaps I’m misunderstanding the term?

35.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@USCWolverine, well, like any term like that (“Southern Ivy”, “Little Ivy”, etc.), the definition may vary, but at least one book lists UIUC as a public Ivy: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Ivy
They have a pretty expansive list, though.

36.<<<USCWolverine>>>
I gotcha, PT.  Mind, I’m one of those guys that literally cringes when I hear Marines, sailors, and/or airmen referred to as “soldiers.”
But as I recall, the Ivy League features only 8 schools, and the easiest one to get into is Cornell.  What’s Cornell’s acceptance rate?  10%?  For me, to call more than a handful of public universities “public ivies” would have no meaning whatsoever.  Is San Diego St. (35% acceptance rate) often referred to as a public ivy? You get my drift 
Again, to be absolutely clear, I’m sure UIUC is an excellent school.

37.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@Momof2022 - What does your son/daughter want? What criteria did you give him/her when applying to schools in terms of what you were willing/able to contribute? What are her social/intellectual/academic wants and needs?
Yes, conventional CC wisdom will tell you to take the money from USC and run. But conventional wisdom doesn’t always provide right answers in every case.
My daughter had to make the same choice last year: she was offered full tuition scholarships at USC, Vandy, and Wash U (and others) and had also gotten into HYPS and UChicago (UChicago gave a decent merit and FA combination; HYPS gave very little FA (under 10K) and, of course, no merit.
The most important criterion my D had was that she wanted to be around really, really bright kids. Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.
USC was not a good fit for my D, despite thinking that it had some interesting programs and seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her – she would NOT have been happy there). Among her full tuition scholarship options, she liked Wash U. the best.
My D, with our unwavering support, chose Stanford and could NOT be happier. To us, it is worth every penny.
That said, she is our only child, so we don’t have any more tuitions to pay. We drive old cars and don’t take lavish vacations. My D is not seeking an education as a means to an end – the only return on investment she seeks (and that we hope for her) is greater knowledge. She will likely end up in a PhD program in the humanities. She loves what she is studying, has had some absolutely amazing and supportive professors, enjoys her fellow students, and finally feels like she has intellectual peers (something she did not have in HS).
She has truly found her tribe there and is absolutely, positively 100% certain that she made the right choice. My DH and I are too.

38.<<<simba9>>>

[/quote]

My sister went to Miami of Ohio, which was one of the original “Public Ivies.” My mother never lost an opportunity to mention that to friends and relatives. Now so many schools are tagged, “Public Ivy”, usually by alumni and parents of alumni, that the term doesn’t mean much anymore.

39.<<<ewho>>>
PT, I can do it in my trading  account by selling options and then buy index fund to experience what you said. It is free of interest.  You need some money to make more.

40.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@ewho, 40Y term, as I said. To sell options, you already need capital. So again, say you have $280K that you spend all on college by emptying out your trading account. Where would you get more capital? Can you sell options if your trading account is empty?

41.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@LoveTheBard, I agree that USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body and that WashU would have the most out of USC/Vandy/WashU (I would have picked the U of C, BTW, but anyway, that’s a different discussion). The OP will have to decide if that matters. From a purely ROI perspective, turning down the full-tuition scholarship to USC is tough to justify.

42.<<<rickle1>>>
Take money out of the equation for a second. No financial concerns where would you go, Harvard, Stanford or USC? And why?
Now add finances back tot he equation. Assuming Harvard / Stanford is the choice, can you make it work without significant hardship on your lifestyle, retirement, etc? If so, great. If not, USC (which is also great)
Big difference between “should I pay vs. could I pay?”  If you’re fortunate enough to be in the “Should I pay” group, really think about the “why”. If it’s meaningful, pay, if not, don’t.

43.<<<privatebanker>>>
@PurpleTitan @LoveTheBard
USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body.
OP. Everyone has their own view on things but this is only personal opinion. There are many doctors researchers professors and other really smart and successful grads that come out of USC. If someone preferred to go to Stanford it’s understandable. But a candidate from USC could easily be in the same PhD program post grad with them and would be very intellectual indeed.
Will there be kids at USC that didn’t have the stats to get into hyps or even Chicago. Sure. But they might be just as smart and turn it on in college or they aren’t but they work hard and e d up starting the next Twitter.  Who knows.
But a blanket statement that usc kids not being intellectual is just silly imho.

44.<<<MYOS1634>>>
What did you tell your child when he prepared his list? Did you say “if you get into Harvard or Stanford, we can pay for it” or did you say " you can choose" or “you must walk away from Harvard or Stanford if you don’t get scholarship money?”
In other words, are you thinking of pulling the rug from under your child’s feet* or are you all hesitating, with your son and active participant in the discussion?
(* Yes parents do that in March or April every year.)

45.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@privatebanker:
“There are many doctors researchers professors and other really smart and successful grads that come out of USC.”
That is definitely true.
“But a candidate from USC could easily be in the same PhD program post grad with them and would be very intellectual indeed.”
Yes, some USC grads do go on to get PhDs, but a far smaller proportion of the student body than at HYPSM or the U of C.
And yes, it’s an overgeneralization, but I think you’d find that a significantly smaller portion of the USC student body go there mainly or solely for the pursuit of knowledge. It’s definitely a pre-professionally focused student body, and there’s nothing wrong with that, nor do I think that’s bad for the OP, who seems pretty pre-professionally focused, but my impression is that a smaller proportion of the kids at USC go there to live the life of the mind compared to at the U of C or HYPSM.

46.<<<privatebanker>>>
I agree to the fine distinction you are making. But broadly saying USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body is not accurate in my opinion.  They may not be as intellectual as Stanford in totality.  Agreed.
But Didn’t tiger woods go there.  Not sure he’s up for a nobel in physics  
Op. The hyps schools are the most elite and broadly speaking, the smartest.
Good luck and let us know what you decide

47.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@privatebanker, you mean Stanford?
Yes, both USC and Stanford would have several types. The proportions would differ.
BTW, I’m not using “intellectual” to stand in for “successful” or even “smart”. You can be both without being intellectual. Nor do I consider it to always be a positive (those who pursue the life of the mind may also be derided as eggheads). In any case, I’m not sure this even matters to the OP, who seems much more pre-professionally focused than interested in pursuing a PhD, anyway.

48.<<<privatebanker>>>
Ok. I understand. Yeah tiger woods went to Stanford before he went on to oxford as a Rhodes scholar  
But I totally agree with your statement about people fetishizing undergrad and assigning this type of labeling seemed to fly inter face of that statement.

49.<<<mdphd92>>>
I would like to gently take some issue with the notion that students at Stanford are “really, really bright” or “brilliant” or “qualitatively different” from those at other top schools.  I speak as someone who attended Stanford, albeit a few decades ago.  I also served as a freshman advisor at Harvard College for many years, and got to know my students’ academic performance quite well.
At these schools, I found relatively few students that were truly brilliant.  They were generally hardworking and motivated and had generally done well in the context of their local high school, or were likable enough that they could get A’s from their high school teachers.  They obviously knew how to do well on standardized tests.  Many had excelled in some particular activity, although typically at a local level, not at a state or national level.  But I often wondered what the admissions office had seen to let some of these people in.
I was not particularly struck by students’ intellectual curiosity either.  A large proportion of students were premed or prelaw or pre-business, which meant they wanted a high grade more than anything else, and often looked for the easiest courses they could take in order to achieve their goals.  There were many recruited athletes, who were not always there for their intellect.  Many students struggled with their course material.  Dinner conversations were generally about mundane, everyday topics.
I don’t know how things are at other colleges, but I do know that at my medical school, some of the most accomplished people and those that received the highest scores on our tests came from places like USC.  Also, the Dean of Stanford Admissions has said that they could have picked a second or third set of people that were equivalent to the set they admitted.  I would imagine that the second or third set of students probably went to other top schools.
Anyway, I just wouldn’t put the student body on some sort of lofty pedestal.  The students at these colleges are just like the people at your school like yourself who got accepted recently and are considering them now.  You can use that as a basis for comparison.

50.<<<privatebanker>>>
@mdphd92  Thank you. And with your direct knowledge very important.  Do you mind if I direct quote your post occasionally on other threads?

51.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^ be careful when you use these comments: post 47 applied to the 80s and 90s, when when acceptance rates were triple what they are today, the competition wasn’t truly global, and no one had heard of either helicopter or tiger parents. That post is less true of the 21sr century and especially not of the past 10 years.
In addition, because she/he’s only been in contact with Stanford and Harvard students and now works at a med school, the poster has very little basis for comparison among teenagers, since she/he’s always been in contact only with tippy top students.

52.<<<privatebanker>>>
Ok.

53.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
^ I was going to make the remark that decades ago, Stanford’s student body was what USC’s is like now in it’s characteristics (and the Stanford students of that period haven’t done too badly–even though I wouldn’t have characterized the Stanford of back then as intellectual; heck, even now, I don’t see Stanford or Harvard undergrad as among the most intellectual student bodies).

54.<<<privatebanker>>>
We aren’t totally sure the date range. I didn’t see that in the post. and as a Stanford grad perhaps she gets back there and interacts. Our subjective analysis on things hold the same exact weight unless you’ve been a student there recently. And if you have it’s still a singular perspective.

55.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
So here’s the thing, @MYOS1634:
The competition to get in at the top has gotten a lot stiffer, but if you ask profs at those schools, they don’t actually see a significant improvement in the academic prowess of undergrads at those schools on average (some improvement, I think you would find some say, but not orders of magnitude different). It could be that a significantly greater percentage of hooked applicants are now let in (making it much harder for the unhooked pool) or adcoms aren’t selecting much for academic prowess (well, OK, we know that’s partially it under holistic admissions).

56.<<<privatebanker>>>
Very true @PurpleTitan
OP let us know what  It decide. It’s an exciting set of opportunities.
Cheers to all!

57.<<<USCWolverine>>>
@PT, USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body? Really?  Could you please expound on that for me?
@LovetheBard, did you also opine that USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body?  I missed that from you, but if you did say it, I’d also like to hear more details from you on this insight.
I was busy rubbing gravel into my head and referring to my son’s accelerated math program as “pretty neat”(he’s learning about equations and stuff, in addition to something they call pre-calcium–thought that would be part of chemistry, but who knew?!) when I saw @PT’s post.  Later I’m going to go watch some Big Time Wrestling and drink Bud with a few of my USC homies.  We’ve all known each other since we met at our internship senior year at Troy–a local meat-packing plant outside Newport Beach.
Glad I was able to check in on CC first, right after shooting a few more rats with my bibi gun out in the back yard…

58.<<<socaldad2002>>>
Note for USC, he got full tuition not full ride or about 200k, not the 300k noted above. Still an awesome deal, and the one I would encourage my kid to take unless full pay at H/S was no hardship at all.

59.<<<observer12>>>
In terms of schools having an “intellectual student body”.
At many no-name high schools all over the country, the seniors most likely to get into Harvard and Stanford are the recruited athletes.  Are they smart?  Sure.  Are they intellectual?  Maybe or maybe not, but that has nothing to do with why they would get in and many smarter and more intellectual students would not.   Often the middle class intellectual students are those who decide to take a merit scholarship.   They are overlooked by the Ivies because being an intellectual does not necessarily translate into an outstanding college application.
Some, like LoveTheBard’s daughter, are so brilliant they easily stand out and are admitted to those schools.  Most don’t stand out nearly as much as the wealthy student from the connected private schools who regularly send a significant number of students to those schools.
“Brilliant minds that are intellectually curious and that want to make a difference in the world. She saw a qualitative difference between the kids at HYPSC and those at the other top schools.”
It’s a bit like the blind men touching one part of the elephant and being certain of its shape based on the part they touched.
A family member went to Stanford and it is not “intellectual”.  It has many students who ARE intellectual and it has  students who are not and are very career focused.  As does Harvard.  As does U. Chicago.  As do Wash U., Duke and USC.  A student can choose to seek them out or not.
Making a difference doesn’t always mean starting a foundation with your family’s money or the connections they have to help you start it. It doesn’t mean developing an app that someone will pay you millions to buy. Making a difference may be those “dull” serious students working hard for As to get into medical school and be the doctors who save lives.  Making a difference may be those “dull” scientists sitting in their labs examining some tiny aspect of mitochondria that will eventually lead to a cure for some disease.
Making a difference is not always an earnest “intellectual” student who loves to talk about ideas and even write about them.

60.<<<USCWolverine>>>
I’m going to post later (real names excluded, of course) a few stats of two AMAZINGLY BRIGHT hs seniors who each got rejected to USC this cycle.  After reading this thread, I now know USC evidently rejected them bc they were too intellectual (and  in one case, her USC alumni MD parents, must also be too intellectual for a place like Troy…As the couple are both extremely intelligent, hard working, and respected doctors, perhaps USC should consider retroactively rescinding their respective medical degrees?  Don’t want overly intellectual USC-trained physicians running around now, do we?!).

61.<<<CU123>>>
Whether or not you become a billionaire has  VERY little (I would say nothing) to do with which college you attended…

62.<<<socaldad2002>>>
There is no such thing as a “public ivy”, it’s really a marketing ploy and/or rationalization for the non-ivy colleges and students to justify attending their schools. Let the ivies be who they are.
I remember an top athlete (softball pitcher) being recruited by Loyola Marymount University (CA) and ultimately verballed. She stated the reason she chose LMU was that it was an ivy of the West!  Lol.

63.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@USCWolverine, it seems as if some here are conflating “intellectual” with “smart” when I don’t see it that way. For example, I wouldn’t consider Penn or even Stanford to be all that intellectually-focused considering that a greater proportion of their student body are career-focused compared even with other top privates.

64.<<<privatebanker>>>
@cu123 It’s just a data point of reference when someone is overly concerned with prestige or intellectualism debate.  My point  being only that usc is plenty tough and intellectual to attract that kind of talent.  But I agree it’s not always about the school. Which is also my point. It’s about application of skill perseverance  and bit of luck in life

65.<<<observer12>>>
I suspect the most purely intellectual college is Reed.  That is why it is not interested in playing the rankings game.  The rankings game is all about attracting a lot of applicants who - deep down – are more concerned with prestige than anything else.
U. of Chicago was one of the most intellectual colleges back when it had 30% and higher admissions rates.  Students didn’t apply there because of prestige – they applied there because they wanted that kind of education.
Chasing prestige is fine and understandable.  But it isn’t something that intellectual colleges care about.

66.<<<CU123>>>
@observer12 you are simple dead wrong about intellectual colleges not caring about rankings.  They all do because it has a definitive effect on their applications.  If you are at the top of the heap and you’re content to do nothing you will soon find yourself at the bottom.

67.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@USCWolverine - In answer to your question, no, I did not say that “USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body.” What I said was “USC was not a good fit for my D, despite her thinking that it had some interesting programs and that it seemed like a very vibrant campus (just not for her – she would NOT have been happy there).” She felt this more socially than academically; immediately after visiting USC, she went to Grinnell (another school that offered her full tuition) which she thought would be a better social – but not as good of an academic (their art history programs were not as interesting to her) – fit.
Of course USC has many, many bright and intellectually curious kids. And Stanford has no shortage of kids that are not the least bit intellectually curious. But the level of discussion in the classrooms and the level of intellectual engagement she experienced was, in the aggregate, qualitatively different among kids at Yale, Stanford, and U Chicago that they were at schools like Vanderbilt, USC, Wash U., etc. (And I agree, getting an overall feel for a school is a bit like blind men poking at an elephant and oftentimes one sees what one wants to see.) Ultimately, for my daughter, it was a matter of not wanting to be a big fish in a smaller pond; she wanted a bigger pond in which to swim.
(And yes, UChicago was a definite contender but she didn’t want the weather; Yale was initially her top choice until she got to New Haven and hated it; she thought about Reed, but ultimately decided not to apply because they did not offer any merit aid (the only non-HYPS schools she applied to were those that offered significant merit aid and she submitted separate scholarship applications to any school that required them). She would have been all over Deep Springs had they been accepting applications from women last year.
And as @rickle1 points out, there is a “Big difference between “should I pay vs. could I pay?” If you’re fortunate enough to be in the “Should I pay” group, really think about the “why”. If it’s meaningful, pay, if not, don’t.” It seems that OP is in that group. And @MYOS1634 is quite correct, there are plenty of families that are tempted to pull the rug out from their kids’ feet when faced with this type of decision.
My daughter was very, very concerned about the finances and she is very well aware that money that is spent on her undergraduate tuition is money that might otherwise be used for other things (e.g., putting a down payment on a home or investing in stocks). In creating her list, we encouraged her to cast a wide net among in-state publics (UCs), LACs and research universities that offered merit aid, and HYPS, etc. and that we would consider her options when we had the results.
Every situation and every family is different. I’m just adding another data point and another point of view.

68.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@CU123, some schools care more about how they transform their students than whether you or anyone else think they are at the top or bottom. Reed is among the top 10 feeders (on a per capita basis) in almost all major PhD subjects despite what you may think of them and thus, when you tier by alumni acheivements, they’re actually an Ivy-equivalent despite being ranked nowhere near the top by USNews.

69.<<<CU123>>>
@PurpleTitan and they suffer the consequences of that by not attracting tippy top applicants.  I’m sure they get a few but far less than they could have.

70.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@CU123, and I repeat again: They Are Among The Top 10 Feeders to PhD programs even without “tippy-top candidates”.
You seem to be one of those guys who measures how successful college football programs are solely by how they do in recruiting rankings rather than, you know, actual wins and losses on the field.

71.<<<CU123>>>
@PurpleTitan No, I don’t, I am simply recognizing THE FACT that rankings are HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL in decision making by applicants and that in turn affects the alumni universities produce.  Period,  Even Reed acknowledges that fact.  Putting your head in the sand and saying rankings don’t make any difference is ridiculous.  BTW, Reed does participate is rankings it does like, not that it is hypocritical or anything.  Whether you “like” rankings or not isn’t germane to this discussion, in fact any ranking (or polls for that matter) system to include sports, colleges, etc will always be controversial.

72.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@CU123, and again, all that highly influential decision-making leads to Reed producing alums that go in to PhD programs in numbers that almost no other school can match despite their ranking being where it is.
So you’re essentially saying that a college football program that consistently wins a ton of games and sends a ton of players to the NFL should care about it’s recruiting rankings because it’s recruiting isn’t highly ranked.

73.<<<WildestDream>>>
Goals? For example, if you wanted to pursue engineering or STEM, the quality of the department would be more meaningful than the “overall” school brand.

74.<<<coolweather>>>
@mom2022
You are the only person who can decide.
What was your original goal? Colleges with free money or full pay at selective colleges?

75.<<<Publisher>>>
I have only read the initial post in this thread. Since the specific Ivy League schools are not revealed, I will assume that this is a USC with full tuition scholarship versus full pay for Stanford thread in which cost is not a major factor.  The easy answer is Stanford, but OP has failed to share enough information for any advice to be meaningful to OP’s specific situation.

76.<<<simba9>>>
I’ve spent plenty of time at both USC and Stanford, and rarely overheard discussions at either campus that were on the level of Plato’s Dialogues. The main difference i found between the two schools is that, on average, Stanford students and teachers are more driven and take their academics more seriously than those at USC. But that doesn’t mean the students at Stanford are geniuses, or the student body at SC is unintellectual. I never got the sense that classes at Stanford were any more challenging than those at USC.
After a few beers, anyone at any school can carry on a deeply intellectual conversation.

[/quote]

Since the title of the thread mentions that some schools are tuition-free while others are full-cost, I had the impression that money was an issue.

77.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@simba9 - My D is in an intensive humanities living/learning core program (a sort of Western – and some Eastern – Civilization course) at Stanford. During the first quarter, there were no shortage of conversations that, while perhaps not at the level of Plato’s Dialogues, certainly concerned themselves with Plato’s Dialogues. Discussions spilled out of the classroom and into the dining hall and later into the lounge. They’ve since moved well past Plato and Aristotle and more recent discussions are about Jean-Paul Sartre, Karl Marx and W. E. B. Du Bois.
There are no right or wrong answers to the choice between taking a full-tuition scholarship at USC versus being full pay at Stanford, and it is completely dependent upon a variety of other factors involving all aspects of fit – academic, social, intellectual, and economic.

78.<<<mdphd92>>>
@LoveTheBard I gather you are talking about SLE (Structured Liberal Education), which they have had at Stanford for a long time (even when I attended).  That experience is probably different from that of most students at Stanford, but it’s limited to 90 students a year.  Also, because they live in a separate dorm, they are somewhat isolated from other students, and I don’t think I ever interacted with anyone from SLE.
When I attended, students were required to take a year-long course in Western Civilization, which was intended to be equivalent to the Great Books curriculum at UChicago and Columbia, and which was supposed to stimulate common discussion among students on a shared reading list.  But we had 9 or so different tracks for Western Civ, each sponsored by a different department, such as history or science and technology, so we never really all read the same set of books.  Anyway, Stanford eliminated its Western Civ requirement 30 years ago, due in part to student pressure, so aside from SLE, there hasn’t been a common core experience at Stanford in a long time.
Stanford has long had a cultural divide between those who major in STEM subjects and those who major in the humanities and social sciences.  Back then, they called each other “techies” and “fuzzies”, and apparently, those terms are still in use today.  See, for example, this recent commentary from the Stanford Daily about the phenomenon:
https://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/10/31/what-came-first-the-fuzzy-or-the-techie/

79.<<<USCWolverine>>>
@PT, if you told someone they “were not very intellectual,” do you think they’d take it as a compliment?
I disagree with you that USC doesn’t have a very intellectual student body, and I am sure OP would find plenty of intellectual classmates and faculty there.

80.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@USCWolverine, I’m finding out what people aspire to, certainly.
If you like, think of “not very intellectual” as “more practical”. I’d describe my own alma mater as “not very intellectual” and I think they’re rather proud of the fact that they produce alums who go on to do great things in many fields (in part because of the pre-professional focus of many programs there).

81.<<<VAMom23>>>
Congrats to your son on his tremendous accomplishments. Some have referenced the USC scholarship as a golden ticket, but those other admission offers must feel like golden tickets too. Walking away from the Ivy offers of admission is going to be understandably hard. We are in a somewhat similar situation where the first choice school was very clear when costs were equal, but a last minute full academic scholarship at #2 makes the choice more difficult.  In our case, the cost differential is much smaller (maybe about 60-70k) but once you “see” that cost savings it is very hard to “unsee” it.   Best of luck with the decision.

82.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@mdphd92 - Yes, I was referring to SLE and yes, it’s been around forever (the parents of one of the students is SLE this year met at SLE during their freshman year over a quarter of a century ago).
As for the techie/fuzzy divide, my D is far less apologetic about her choice of study than the author of that article. She has no “shame… about being a fuzzy” nor “insecurity about pursuing an uncommon path…” She embraces her choices wholeheartedly and is passionate about what she is studying.
It is indeed the case that STEM fields reign supreme at many colleges and universities these days. Humanities and the arts often get short shrift in a society where “return on investment” and job placement seem to be among the most important factors in choosing an institute of higher learning. (Most of the posts on this thread concern themselves with this very issue). It is also the case that those who choose to study the humanities at Stanford can have all of the faculty support and resources they need.
I see Stanford as ahead of the curve on this – while other schools are scrambling to shore up their STEM programs, Stanford has been investing some real money into its arts and humanities programs over the course of the last decade.
Oh, as to the question “What came first, the fuzzy or the techie?” My answer is “Neither.” Back in Leonardo’s day, science and art were not seen in such mutually exclusive terms; he is celebrated as much for his scientific genius as he was for his artistic genius.
And, @USCWolverine – just because USC was not a good fit for my D, who happened to be seeking an intellectual vibe, does not mean that there aren’t a great number of highly intellectual students and faculty there and that it isn’t a fabulous school. It just wasn’t the “golden ticket” for my daughter.

83.<<<jzducol>>>
IMO, for fuzzies—humanities majors–the brand name of the college really matters; a HYPS degree would probably go a long way to boost one’s career prospect.  For techies, not so much, among new hires at FANG, SJSU beats MIT and U of Phoenix beats Harvard.  Economics/business (OP son’s intended study), at undergrad level, is probably more fuzzy than techie.
This question of Stanford/Harvard(full pay) vs USC(or similar schools) full tuition merit is asked multiple times every year on CC. Though the opinion seems to be 10 to 1 in favor of merit I have yet to see a taker of that option.

84.<<<SCMHAALUM>>>
My son tagged along with us for my daughter’s college tour when he was in 7th grade and fell in love with Stanford, mostly because of our student guide who appeared to be very happy and passionate about the school and his major.   I had this conversation back then with him about USC scholarship vs Stanford.  I am an SC alum that’s why :).  Told him if he got scholarship from SC he should go there (he is a science/math kid who loves to dance).  So that’s our value.  Each family have their own values.
Well things do not go as planned.  He decided he wanted to pursue dance (together with bio) so now USC dance program became his #1 choice. Like film school, it’s extremely hard to get in.  He is wait listed at USC dance and we are looking to put down deposit at Stanford (bio).  He is not a super “intellectual” kid as his friends who got full tuition scholarship at USC or Regents Scholarships from UC’s, but he is one of the kindest and most passionate and hardworking kids I know.  We are very grateful Stanford saw that and accepted him.  Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship.

85.<<<privatebanker>>>
Seriously folks. These grand generalizations are meaningless. Like any broad generalizations they may be grounded in the past experiences or continuation of a myth.
Here’s a real world 2018 example.
I
my d is valedictorian of her top 30 us public high school. Number 1 in Florida. 1540 sat 4.0 uw gpa.  35 act 13 aps with 11 5s and 1 4.  President of Spanish honor society and captain of academic decathlon team as only female. And was ap physics ap bio and ap chem student of the year. Going to USC for bio chem premed. She doesn’t sit around with her friends smoking weed and discussing the Freud Jungian schism.  But she’s pretty intellectual.
It just doesn’t matter. Go to Stanford kick butt and pay back the loans. Go to usc kick butt and not have to pay the loans. The same exact opportunity for success is available in either path.
Go where you feel best about yourself and an environment that promotes your best work.  It could be either but it’s unique  to each student.

86.<<<jmek15>>>
If your student attends USC on a full tuition scholarship they won’t be the only one there who gave up an Ivy. It’s not uncommon. Save your money for the Wharton or Harvard MBA.

87.<<<CU123>>>
No guarantee is getting into Wharton or Harvard grad school.

88.<<<VAMom23>>>
@CU123 Every time I hear someone say save the $$ for ivy graduate school I wonder about what you have posted. Shouldn’t it just be save the $$ for grad school.

89.<<<privatebanker>>>
When I have used that phrase I only mean to illustrate the opportunity before them. And the call of the ivy is not a closed door either.
I could say for any any grad school. A house or future child’s first semester at the school you are reluctant to accept a full scholarship from today.

90.<<<menloparkmom>>>
@SCMHAALUM "Majors/interests are probably more important in considerations and as of now, he would go to USC regardless of scholarship. "
did you DS let the USC admissions office KNOW that? And that he DID get into Stanford but wants to go to USC?
It may be enough to tip the balance in his favor.
If I were you I would contact them.
here is the #  for the Dean of Admission- Brunold, Timothy. 310 740-6753.
[tell him Menloparkmom  from CC suggested you call] My DS was a Trustee Scholar 12 years ago.
I’ll bet they would love to snatch a top kid out of Stanfords grasp.
Its worth a call…

91.<<<sbballer>>>
USC admissions will respond to a phone call… and tell them you’re ready to pull the trigger that day otherwise they got a bunch of folks calling with similar requests and they won’t take you seriously.
for those that say go to MBA for grad school…
no guarantee of that…  admit rate for Stanford MBA is almost as low as undergrad 4.3%
Stanford GSB 6% admit rate
Harvard 11%,
Wharton 19%.

92.<<<SCMHAALUM>>>
@menloparkmom Yes he did let Dance school know.  But it’s talent based at dance admissions…I will pass the info to my son.  Thank you!

93.<<<jmek15>>>
@CU123 and @Vamom23, when I made the statement above it was more from a financial perspective, which is personal because I believe that graduating from college at 22 years old with debt will limit your options for the short and long-term. To me, no debt = more options in all aspects of a young life. Again, it’s personal and I’m not trying to start a debate. I know many argue that debt incurred to attend a top university is worth it. For me it’s not.
The references to Wharton and Harvard were simply because the student seems very accomplished and those are the types of school they might be likely to apply to. Really, not a lot of thought went into it. Best wishes to the OP! You have some great choices.

94.<<<simba9>>>
My understanding is that USC specifically targets students who were accepted into Ivies, Stanford, MIT, etc., with merit aid as a way to lure them to USC. So I would definitely let USC know if Stanford had accepted one of your children.

95.<<<menloparkmom>>>
"My understanding is that USC specifically targets students who were accepted into Ivies, Stanford, MIT, etc., with merit aid as a way to lure them to USC. "
^that’s not correct. USC doesnt know who is going to get into HYPS when they are making the decisions regarding merit $$ ,which happens in mid March.
They DO award merit $$ to some students who do have the stats to get into HYPS , such as the 1/2 tuition National Merit awards . But no merit awards are based on where else the student applied. In fact, for the big awards that require interviews, which are by invitation only, any indication that a student is not GENUINELY interested and enthusiastic about going to USC means they probably will recieve little if any merit $$.

96.<<<mom_2022>>>
Congratulations to you and your daughter.
My senior sounds alot like her.  Also an only child.  We are letting him choose the best fit and are trying not to put the $$ into the equation.

97.<<<mom_2022>>>
Agree.  My senior is not a genius but is a hard worker!!!
Only child.  We do not quality for money based on the FEC calculator and both Harvard and Stanford offer no merit tuition.  We have planned for college cost so yes can pay for it but the practical side is asking is it worth giving up full tution (not room/board) at USC or a nice merit scholarship at University of Chicago.  We want his choice to be based on a best fit  (if that’s possible).
The decision date is May 1, he is still undecided.

98.<<<mom_2022>>>
Thank you.  I agree with you.  And although we are hoping he decides based on “best fit” the cost is hard to separate.

99.<<<mom_2022>>>
Yes!  That is why this is so hard,  we keeping asking-- given the chance(if its the dream college)  so why not take it, you may not get it again!!!

100.<<<privatebanker>>>
Every school on your list is a dream college. In this microscopic world of high achievers on CC and in our own heads this becomes a loud and confusing conversation.  Obviously Harvard Princeton Yale and Stanford are considered undergraduate royalty. USC is a Senator and UIUC is a congresswoman. In the world they live in it matters. To the other 8b people it is indistinguishable. Go to the place that works best for you all. And stop agonizing. The ultimate success will depend on the hard work and decisions made by your student over time. Much less than school choice.
For me I would go Harvard because I love the house system and the professors I could interact with,  if money wouldn’t cripple the lives of everyone else in the family. If that where the case I would say USC. But disclaimer my student is going to USC from the northeast and has many other fabulous ie options gtown bowdoin and uf honors college. The last one is just not happening for a host of reasons so money is a uniquely personal family decision.

101.<<<ewho>>>
Go to stanford admit weekend to see if he likes it.

102.<<<Nomorelurker>>>
@mom@2022, congrats to your student and to you as parents whose support no doubt played a part in her/his successful application process. Our S applied to Stanford and USC, but did not make Stanford and got the Presidential half tuition at USC. In our case, we had decided in advance that had he gotten Trustee at USC and Stanford as your student has, he would have chosen USC. Unless your family qualifies for financial aid from Stanford, I agree with others that it is not worth $300k for the Stanford option. Do well at USC and go to Stanford for grad school! All the above is based on your student feeling that USC is a good fit! As far as the Marshall Business school, it’s decent, but not comparable in my view to Wharton, Michigan Ross, MIT and other top ten business programs around the country. As I recall, Stanford does not offer business as an undergraduate degree.

103.<<<Burrito12>>>
I think money matters the most if it’s even a slight concern, because all these colleges offer a comparable education and their pros and cons. If your student has a strong preference towards a single college, that should trump everything else, but if not, I think money could be important.

104.<<<ultapradesh>>>
@“mom@2022” Congratulatiin on such wonderful choices. I am trying to figure out if UUIC gives out of state applicant any scholarship. Are you in state or out of state applicant to Illinois. Would appreciate this information. thanks

105.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@ultapradesh - According to their FA info, approximately half of the aid given at UIUC is based on merit, and half based on need:
http://admissions.illinois.edu/Invest/financial-aid
It looks like they don’t give aid to international students, but they don’t indicate that OOS students are not eligible for FA or merit scholarships, other than one or two scholarships specific to Illinois residents.
Here’s a list of merit scholarships:
http://admissions.illinois.edu/Invest/scholarships-all

106.<<<ultapradesh>>>
@LoveTheBard    Thanks. Under Illinois Residents & Non-Residents category there is only $2000 award. It seems that UUIC not a good fit for OOS student looking for merit or need based aid.

107.<<<mom_2022>>>
We are in state.  For UIUC received a merit tution funded part by the school and part by private scholarship fund.  I have no knowledge for outof state.  Good luck to you.

108.<<<mom_2022>>>
Thank you to everyone who posted.  In the end we let my senior make his decision (after many family discussions).    He will attend Havard in the fall.  For him this was the best fit.  Believe me it was not easy to give up scholarships at some great schools but the reward and investment into my son’s education and future we believe will be worth it!!!

109.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Congratulations!
And thank you for letting us know.

110.<<<HiToWaMom>>>
Congratulations! It must have been very hard making the decision.  Thank you for the update.
