First of all, I was extremely excited to be admitted to both schools, and I'm not sure I can really make a wrong decision with either one, but there are definitely certain drawbacks associated with each that I'd like to ask you all about. I'll be posting this in the Columbia forum for other opinions as well.

2.<<<alwaysstressed>>>
It would be one thing if it was simply "normal" Cal vs. Columbia (in which case I would advise Cal), but if you're a REGENTS scholar, I think the choice is clear.

The worry of not getting attention/research opportunities completely disappears if you're a Regents scholar at a school as great as Cal, especially in engineering. I'm pretty sure you'd get better research (in the field of engineering) at Cal than Columbia anyway.

And I think Cal is a better choice because of the financial aid factor. You can always go to New York City later but you can't always go live in a college town/city. I think the experience will be "new and thrilling" anywhere you go.

3.<<<phantasmagoric>>>
In this case, I'd definitely say Berkeley. Not only is it cheaper, it's better in engineering, equally prestigious in academia and more prestigious in the general public (according to a Gallup poll), in an awesome city with access to SF, etc. Here's what I posted to someone who is in almost the same situation as you ($30k difference)--replace "Stanford" with "Columbia":
[quote]Now, assuming that none of this changes and you really would have to put yourself in $120k of debt to go to Stanford, I'd say the answer is obvious: go to Berkeley. Normally, I'd say that Berkeley has a lot of disadvantages that would make going to Stanford, even if it costs more, a better option, like class registration and housing. But with Regents in hand, you don't have to worry about those so much.

Just for perspective, I am a diehard Stanford fan and will argue in favor of Stanford in many threads as being the best choice. I could go on ad nauseum about the many ways that Stanford would be better--but in the end, none of those is worth that much debt. Luckily for you, the alternative is not Podunk State: it's the best public university in the country (possibly the world--Oxbridge are private in all but name) and will offer you a superb education, and being a Regents Scholar gives you a leg-up in facing the difficulties that large schools like Berkeley pose to their students.[/quote]

Don't worry about the difficulty of ChemE--Berkeley wouldn't be giving you the Regents if it didn't think you could handle the school. You'll be among the top students there, and I'm certain you'll do well.

4.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
All those rankings are for graduate students, so let's not all of a sudden believe something that is not true.

The Gallup poll on popularity is a joke phantas. What about the poll that ranked Columbia the second most searched school in the country only after Harvard...

Anyhow: I think we should bring things back to the fact that your experience will be different at both schools. I am unfamiliar with the Regents Scholar program, but it sounds like it alleviates some worry. In the end it is not sufficient to detract from some of the real personal benefits you might gain leaving the comfort of Northern California and venturing out east to attend Columbia. Not only is SEAS a great undergraduate education, Columbia itself is very good at creating a culture of inquiry, debate and encouraging individual growth in all aspects.

Especially friends of mine that majored in ChemE all were quite happy with their coursework, and have gone on to do just about everything under the sun in terms of graduate study or working usually at Big Pharma (which is very present not far from campus in New Jersey).

I don't agree with the Cal Boosters that this is an open and shut case. It is very much a question of personal decisionmaking. If you are feeling adventurous, you want a major metropolitan center, you want to go to a school that is more than 75% Californians, with a greater international reach (if equal the international reputation), Columbia is a great opportunity, something that will change your life. Going to Berkeley will be great, but I'm sure you can predict, even now, what your life might look like.

California will always be there...the chance to study somewhere else comes only once.

5.<<<GoldOwl>>>
I agree with admissionsgeeks that Columbia definitely provides the intellectual and cultural diversity. However, I am thinking that Berkeley might be the better choice because 1.) it's cheaper 2.) better engineering program 3.) regents scholar. Ultimately, both Columbia and UC Berkeley are AMAZING schools and you cannot go wrong either way.

6.<<<phantasmagoric>>>
[quote]All those rankings are for graduate students, so let's not all of a sudden believe something that is not true.[/quote]

For engineering? Columbia is no doubt far behind Berkeley in engineering, so the grad rankings are right. Otherwise the city of New York wouldn't be handing out hundreds of millions of $ to another top engineering school to set up a campus in the city and would've given it to Columbia instead.
[quote]The Gallup poll on popularity is a joke phantas. What about the poll that ranked Columbia the second most searched school in the country only after Harvard...[/quote]

I'm not saying that any popularity poll has significance. But the Gallup poll isn't a joke--you'd be the first to claim that the Gallup doesn't know how to do an accurate survey.

But again, take what you will from it. Many don't care about prestige in the general public.
[quote]I don't agree with the Cal Boosters that this is an open and shut case. It is very much a question of personal decisionmaking.[/quote]

I'm not a "Cal Booster" by any stretch of the imagination. As you probably know, I'm a student at Stanford. But I'm practical when it comes to issues like this, and Columbia is not worth $120k of debt, not when he has Berkeley on the table, with Regents at that. The person I mentioned in my first post is deciding between Stanford and Berkeley Regents, with a $120k difference, and I told him the same: Stanford isn't worth that much debt when you have an offer like Berkeley Regents. No school is.

So of course there are personal factors that go into decisions like this, but at the end of the day, telling that to the OP isn't very helpful. Obviously he/she would prefer to go to Columbia (or Stanford, in the other person's case), but it's just not practical or worthwhile when it's going to put you $120k in debt.

7.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
A) All polling the most important thing is the question you ask, the question itself carries significant bias, and asking a different question yields different results. Being good at polling (aka knowing how to achieve a representative sample size) does not mean your poll is useful. You can still make an excellent poll, and it could be a joke. And particularly there is a tendency in polling for the question to be 'overly broad,' and when it is, it renders the usefulness of the poll null.

B) Graduate rankings do not measure quality of undergraduate education, nor does it properly approximate distance between programs. The jump from 2-18 could be large or small. Reading such graduate rankings as absolute truth is beyond laughable.

C) The city of New York accepted multiple bids for the money, but haven't decided who to select yet. So the fact that you present something as fact when it is uncertain is quite poor.

D) In our tete-a-tete a common theme continues to be your uncritical use of data to explain phenomenon that the data or evidence does not in fact represent.

E) There are opportunity costs for sure that the OP as well as you or I or anyone would have to consider when choosing between various options, it is what makes them properly options. The fact of the matter is that it is not an open and shut case, and the OP recognizes this as such based on his/her desire to seek out more information. You've made the conclusion that the OP will go into $120k in debt. Where is your proof? He/she says that the price difference between the schools is $30k, but what if his/her family has that kind of money on hand? What if the OP would have to go into debt anyhow just to go to Cal? Indeed we could presume the actual post-college debt for the OP could be more or less than $120k. WE do not have enough information to make such a claim. Doing so is poor deduction. In the end, the OP will have to determine with his/her family what is a reasonable amount of debt, and what the proper trade off is. Many students face a similar conundrum as the OP and some have chosen Columbia, some have chosen their local state university (and especially well respected schools like Berkeley, Mich, UVa).

F) There are factors that we are missing here when we deal in bare bones idealism. Experience is chief among them. The ability to research at Columbia, especially in ChemE is very easy. Placement from Columbia undergrad despite its perceived lower ranking (which I've expounded at length as being undeserved) is very high for ChemE.

Ultimately: this is a family decision and a student's wish must always be taken into consideration with the family's ability to pay. Families on the other hand need to avoid a kind of crude cost-benefit analysis trying to optimize the pennies of an experience - you must go to X school because it is cheaper, irrespective of fit. Doing so is a disservice to what makes universities great (and it is why the UC system is in such shambles). The fact is that the choice of where to attend is an unsatisfying one: no one feels 100% certain that it is the best choice. The goal is to make a choice you can live with.

I think the OP can certainly live with the Cal choice. It is in fact an easy choice. Without knowing particulars of his/her situation, I do offer more information about Columbia to hopefully allow him/her to see that as a choice he/she could live with as well.

[quote]All those rankings are for graduate students, so let's not all of a sudden believe something that is not true.[/quote]

I'm sorry but you can't even go close to saying that Berkeley is not stronger than Columbia in terms of engineering. It was ranked the third best engineering school *overall* with Columbia nowhere near. And in terms of opportunity, Berkeley is located near other engineering powerhouses like Stanford and Caltech. Pasadena alone is a wealth of opportunity.
[quote]Cal Boosters[/quote]

No.
[quote]California will always be there...the chance to study somewhere else comes only once.[/quote]

New York City will always be there too...?


Instead of just trying to say the opposite of what the people who are actually trying to give good advice are saying, you should give reasoning behind your comments.

I personally believe that someone concerned about money, research, and opportunity with a Regents Scholarship at Cal should not even think twice about going. Columbia's curriculum does not adhere perfectly to engineering majors, and that reflects on the schools performance in that field.

9.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
alwaysstressed:

if you don't care to read with care my message, why respond to it. First you clearly do not know how to read graduate school rankings. Columbia is a great engineering school for graduate students (let alone undergraduates). In the pantheon of universities that offer engineering degrees it is better than the vast majority. Does that mean it is the top top tier, no. But some how proclaiming uncritically that you know something when all you've said is nothing is not useful. There is a trade-off one gains always when attending a lower ranked school, sometimes it is worth it for the experience (less stress), etc.

The student is from California, has roots in California, and the propensity will be to stay in California if he/she attends Cal or the like. New York City is a great yonder, and will open up not just New York, but the East Coast, and the kind of progression will indeed open up considerations of other places.

Provinciality is certainly a problematic of staying too close to home. It is not to say there are not plenty of counterexamples, but it is the vast inertia of experience that dictates that if the student wishes something different, he/she ought to try something different now and not later. As someone out in the real world, I know this much to be true. A lot of my friends have difficulty getting out of the cities they went to college in. This is not an argument of absolutism, indeed he/she can be a screw up attending either school, but it is to offer a proper counterweight in this conversation.

The OP will in the end decide what is best based on the information received.

I still don't get what you wanted to argue, but I will leave it to the other viewers on this thread to determine if what you wrote above demonstrates your abilities to make a sound argument.

10.<<<joso2015>>>
i obviously think columbia is usually the better choice being columbia-bound myself, but in this situation, i'd say berkeley. you'll be right close to home, you'll pay a fraction of the tuition, you have that scholar program, and the engineering is better there. that being said, i still think columbia would provide a more interesting experience, but in this case i think cal is the easier choice.

11.<<<confidentialcoll>>>
2 things to consider:

1) Columbia places better for finance jobs, and finance pays about 2-3 times what engineering does in the first 5 years out of college. Many engineers at top schools realize this and self select into finance jobs. There's less job security, more risk, but 2x is huge whether you are paying off debt or not. Ask someone at MIT where top kids are trying to work, the answer will be Phd / Big tech company like Google / Tech Start Up / Finance.

2) In terms of class quality Columbia SEAS (Duke SEAS as well) has scores to match MIT.

<a href="http://profiles.asee.org/profiles/5036/screen/19?school_name=Columbia+University" rel="nofollow">Columbia University - 2010</a>

2010 SATs:

750-800 on Math
680-760 on Verbal

~97% in the top 10% of their graduating class

I had friends work for NASA, Google, Microsoft, Boeing over the summer, there are top engineering positions available coming out of Columbia. But many tend to do something different like Finance, Law, Medicine, Consulting, PhD, International development research or some unrelated passion like working for CNN.

UCB is generally considered a stronger engineering school with better rankings, but student quality in an engineering school does not necessarily correlate well to engineering rankings on US News. The opportunities to do well are all there at Columbia, but 120k is a lot. If your family happens to be high net worth and 120k is not a big issue, then I would advocate Columbia. If 120k is a big deal to them / if you have to take on debt, UCB is not a bad place to be at all.

12.<<<phantasmagoric>>>
admissionsgeek,
[quote]And particularly there is a tendency in polling for the question to be 'overly broad,' and when it is, it renders the usefulness of the poll null.[/quote]

I think I trust Gallup here--they know exactly how to word a poll (it's the most important thing when doing a poll), how to select randomly, etc. They're experts, so they know how to conduct an accurate poll.

Doesn't matter though, because I didn't say that it has to be useful--I was just pointing it out (in case the OP was considering layman's prestige), so please stop making a big deal out of it.
[quote]Graduate rankings do not measure quality of undergraduate education, nor does it properly approximate distance between programs.[/quote]

But they do measure quality of the department, which undergrads are exposed to. There's no denying that people don't use graduate rankings in their choices--all the time people say "I chose X because they had a stronger program in Y," and the only discipline rankings around are graduate rankings (other than the ancient Gourman rankings). And it's to good effect: there tends to be a material difference between the top and lower-ranked programs. That difference carries over pretty well to undergrads.
[quote]There are opportunity costs for sure that the OP as well as you or I or anyone would have to consider when choosing between various options, it is what makes them properly options.[/quote]

Those opportunity costs are the same if he goes to Columbia...
[quote]You've made the conclusion that the OP will go into $120k in debt. Where is your proof? He/she says that the price difference between the schools is $30k, but what if his/her family has that kind of money on hand?[/quote]

There's no proof, but Columbia is not worth an extra $120k when Berkeley Regents is on the table. Not even Harvard is worth that extra $120k. The difference in quality is not that big, esp. for a Regents scholar.

Now, if the OP were super rich, sure, go with whatever you like the most. But judging by the tone of his post and his own agonizing over the cost difference, it seems that it would be harder to pay for Columbia. In that case, it makes sense to go with the cheaper (and equally good) option.
[quote]Experience is chief among them. The ability to research at Columbia, especially in ChemE is very easy. Placement from Columbia undergrad despite its perceived lower ranking (which I've expounded at length as being undeserved) is very high for ChemE.[/quote]

It's also easy to research in ChemE at Berkeley... after all, Berkeley is a major research university with enormous numbers of the highest-caliber faculty, along with thousands of grad students. So again, the difference in the ability to do research is negligible.
[quote]Ultimately: this is a family decision and a student's wish must always be taken into consideration with the family's ability to pay.[/quote]

Of course, that's the whole point.
[quote]avoid a kind of crude cost-benefit analysis trying to optimize the pennies of an experience - you must go to X school because it is cheaper, irrespective of fit. Doing so is a disservice to what makes universities great (and it is why the UC system is in such shambles).[/quote]

I'm sorry, but this is just naive idealism. Sure, it may do a "disservice to what makes universities great," but the reality is, Berkeley is just as good as Columbia, esp. with a scholarship like Regents in hand. So yes, fit is important, but the ultimate choice often <i>has</i> to come down to cost--not everyone has the comfort of being able to choose on which fits better, esp. when the cost difference is so great. But again, if the OP can pay for it easily, then that changes things. My sense was that it's difficult.

13.<<<phantasmagoric>>>
[quote]2010 SATs:

750-800 on Math

I'll add to the OP that Columbia does not include any of the SAT scores of its nontraditional students, whereas Berkeley does. These nontraditional students are admitted to General Studies at Columbia, but they will be in the same undergraduate classes, with the same professors, etc. They will be your peers as well. Berkeley would have comparably high scores if it only took the top X% of those enrolled in their undergraduate degree programs and reported only their SAT scores.

I don't think the caliber of your peers will be very different--Berkeley attracts tons of the very brightest students (many have said that the top 25% of Berkeley's student body is comparable to the student bodies at top-10 private schools), and of course there are those who are "weaker" that bring the SAT ranges down. So I'd say that the undergraduate populations at Berkeley and Columbia are comparable (though Berkeley's is a bit different since it's a public school, so it'll attract a different type of student--often those with lower incomes, etc.).

14.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
phantas: it is for this reason that rankings are bad, they compare apples to oranges when they try to flatten distinctions between columbia and berkeley.

i don't think your deduction makes sense because you can't compare. further, columbia only has overlap with general studies in the arts and sciences and not engineering, in engineering there is no age limit of applicants. but once again, a fact you were unaware when you posted.

i have never once said berkeley wasn't a great option, i have only meant to provide arguments and information to help the OP in making the decision. if berkeley wasn't a reasonable choice then the OP would not be agonizing over this choice. i know students in his situation that have chosen columbia, and those that have chosen Berkeley (or fill in your awesome state school with merit funding). and no one can put a price on experience.

also: HELLO of course opportunity costs go both ways, that is what makes them opportunity costs. i have never denied there aren't reasons not to go to columbia, but that isn't my goal here. it is to provide reasons to go, and allow the OP to make up his/her mind.

15.<<<mrunderdog>>>

19.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
ladygogo:

what is the methodology used for the undergraduate rankings? perhaps because i'm trained to be skeptical at all data and treat it as helpful, but not definitive, i prefer not to engage in silly uses of that data. if anything it gives you a universe of thinking, but not an actual truth.

it doesn't change the fact that at a head-to-head comparison the data by itself is not helpful. because rankings have biases (they ask individuals who are unfamiliar at times with programs to rank them) and there are individuals who have biases against columbia's program because of its quirkiness (it is ranking Reed poorly even though it is a better school than most of the other schools). but there are reasons still yet to apply to columbia and attend. the cohort in terms of performance at columbia is top notch - seas admits some of the best, most impressive engineers in the country. this is irrespective of rankings, and most individuals will concede that your cohort makes the experience. they have some of the most impressive outcomes with engineers going on to lead extremely successful lives in all walks of engineering, business and politics. by every metric, seas attracts the best engineering students.

considering that columbia seas doesn't often lose students to cal eng, or uiuc eng, or a handful of schools with better engineering reputations (rather it mostly loses to schools that are considered peers overall at an undergraduate level - mit, caltech, hyp, stanford), i think it is entirely reasonable to conclude that in this case the rankings seem to be especially irrelevant.

frankly it sounds like a false rallying cry of Cal boosters to prove that it is better than anything real. the fact of the matter is they are different experiences, and the rankings do not allow for nor do they respect this fact.

20.<<<Skraylor>>>
Screw rankings and any argument about experiences.

Why would you advocate someone go into debt over school when the free option is just as good if not better than the expensive one?

Do you REALLY think coming out of school with an $80k ($20k/yr) debt hanging over their head is a good thing? Why start off your adult life like that if you dont absolutely have to?

Half of what's wrong with the (first) world is people trying to live above their means. Don't lead this kid in the wrong direction.

21.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
I'm not telling the OP that finances do not matter. But at what point have we learned that he/she will go into debt?

22.<<<LadyGoGo>>>
admissionsgeek, you claimed that graduate engineering programs can't be used to gauge the quality of undergrduate engineeering programs. Then, when presented with undergrduate engineering rankings, you claim that those don't mean anything.

seriously, there is no comparison regarding UC Berkeley's engineering program to Columbia's..

UC Berkeley's is in the top 3 in the country and Columbia's isn't even in the top 20.

23.<<<herenow>>>
Here's a way to rank undergraduate programs in specific departments: take the average of the graduate ranking for that dept (which captures the quality of the faculty and the research going on) with the overall undergraduate ranking (which captures the overall undergraduate experience, the quality of the student body, etc). So Columbia is #4 undergrad and #16 graduate (well within the top 20) according to usnews. Berkeley is #22 undergrad and #3 graduate. So if you average them, then Columbia comes out a little ahead.

Of course, you might want to give more weight to grad (dept strength) or undergad (student and education quality), in which case you'll get different results. See how arbitrary it is? That's essentially what *must* happen in per-department undergrad rankings...you just have to pick what factors to weigh over something else. The two factors above are as good as any. At least with the overall grad and undergrad rankings there are some pretty obvious criteria to use (though even those are subject to different weightings and subjective biases also, hence the differences between usnews and other ranking systems).

24.<<<LadyGoGo>>>

[quote]^^^herenow, why are you using the graduate school USNWR engineering rankings and not the undergraduate school USNWR engineering rankings in your analysis, as has been provided earlier?[/quote]

I thought this was clear from my post -- that undergraduate rankings in specific departments or areas are very arbitrary. To illustrate that, I gave a way of creating such rankings yourself, just average the grad school rankings (measuring department/area strength) with the overall undergrad rankings (measuring student quality etc). You can then change the weightings of these two main factors yourself. Unless you fully understand how usnews is doing their engineering-specific undergrad rankings and agree with their weightings and judgements, you'd be better off with the more transparent method outlined above.

26.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
seriously ladygogo: the two are comparable. if they were not comparable (yet different) students who were admitted to both wouldn't choose columbia over berkeley many times.

if, for some reason, you could prove to me any of the following metrics, i would concede that berkeley is better than columbia.

1) they admit higher quality engineering students
2) engineers from berkeley have statistically significant advantages over columbia seas undergraduates in career placement.
3) berkeley has a better undergraduate experience for engineers.

all three points or any of them is sufficient to say that berkeley is better. but in the end they are all and each unprovable. indeed any attempt to prove that harvard is the best university in the world is an exercise in reductionism. there are things in the world in which liberty university is the best, but every school has its achilles' heel. failing to recognize such and to use rankings as absolute truth is lazy.

are you lazy ladygogo?

You keep hanging on to these meaningless undergrad engineering rankings. Start with what's reasonably clear: Columbia is ranked #4 undergraduate. This measures the overall quality of the undergraduate experience and the quality of the students. Columbia's graduate engineering ranking is at #16. This measures the quality of the faculty and the research they do. So the undergrad engineering program is somewhere between those two. Berkeley suffers from being relatively weak at the undergraduate level with much lower admissions standards.

30.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
USNWR undergrad rankings are just as arbitrary. They apply arbitrary weights to stats that schools manipulate.

[quote]USNWR undergrad rankings are just as arbitrary. They apply arbitrary weights to stats that schools manipulate.[/quote]

Right, all rankings are somewhat arbitrary. But there's much more agreement and transparency on the general parameters with both the undergrad rankings and the graduate/research rankings. You know pretty much where they come from and can adjust accordingly. The per-department undergrad rankings are much more arbitrary. It's hard to know what they even mean. That's why I suggested a weighting of the other two as a much better proxy.

33.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
LadyGogo:

So you are refusing to answer my questions. Thanks for letting me know.

And USNWR National Rankings is for the United States (not to be confused with the world rankings they do, which often end up being Anglocentric because of the USNWR partner), it never says it is for all the World. But that is a degree of nuance perhaps lost on you.

And your ignorance about the Combined Plan program is laughable. Not only must one maintain a 3.0, they must also attend a top flight liberal arts school, complete all the pre-engineering requirements, complete major requirements at their school. It means they might need to take summer courses to finish, and must make a reasonable attempt to find courses in computer science or electrical systems that may not be offered at their school. It is so rigorous that many of those that actually enter Columbia end up winning many prizes and awards for their achievements even in a brief stay at Columbia. It is nothing to sneeze at. Oh and great engineering programs like Michigan also have combined plan programs.

34.<<<LadyGoGo>>>

While biases will undoubtedly have an effect on any set of rankings, the biases will certainly not distort the rankings so horribly that they have <i>no</i> truth behind them. When one rankings website, like US News, says something, people might not believe it because they think its biased toward a specific university, but when multiple rankings website says the same thing, then the chances that every single of those website is biased toward the <i>same</i> university is extremely small.
[quote]but there are reasons still yet to apply to columbia and attend. the cohort in terms of performance at columbia is top notch - seas admits some of the best, most impressive engineers in the country. this is irrespective of rankings, and most individuals will concede that your cohort makes the experience. they have some of the most impressive outcomes with engineers going on to lead extremely successful lives in all walks of engineering, business and politics. by every metric, seas attracts the best engineering students.[/quote]

Hmm, that's not what my interviewer told me. Columbia was my top choice when looking at colleges last year, but after actually reading through the research done in ChemE and reading some abstracts by ChemE professors there, I was not really all that interested anymore. And, when I had my Columbia interview, unfortunately the interviewer seemed to say that while Columbia as a whole is a great school, it was certainly not the best for engineering, which I thought was odd since he was supposed to be trying to convince me to go there if I got in. Anyway, that was my experience with Columbia.
[quote]considering that columbia seas doesn't often lose students to cal eng, or uiuc eng, or a handful of schools with better engineering reputations (rather it mostly loses to schools that are considered peers overall at an undergraduate level - mit, caltech, hyp, stanford), i think it is entirely reasonable to conclude that in this case the rankings seem to be especially irrelevant.[/quote]

What?? What are you talking about? Are you trying to tell us that Harvard's engineering has a better engineering reputation than Berkeley or Columbia? Also, can you please tell us the website where you found out that Columbia doesn't lose that many students to Cal eng?

[quote]frankly it sounds like a false rallying cry of Cal boosters to prove that it is better than anything real. the fact of the matter is they are different experiences, and the rankings do not allow for nor do they respect this fact.[/quote]

Sure, they are different experiences, but the way you seem to be talking, it seems you are saying that rankings do not matter at all, which is certainly not the case. They <i>do</i> matter to some extent when trying to get a job in the future or for grad school or anything else. You cannot ignore the rankings that LadyGoGo had posted. Also, if you are not fond of US news (because I'm not either), you should try looking at
<a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2010-2011/engineering-and-IT.html" rel="nofollow">Top Universities for Engineering &amp; Technology 2010-2011</a>.

Their methodology, in my opinion, makes more sense. Also, just some quick facts from Times ranking:
Columbia was rated to have a 73.8/100 for research, while Berkeley had a 99.3 (the highest). Also, for engineering, Berkeley is ranked #5 in the world, while Columbia is not in the top 50.

I'm not saying go way or the other, because I think both schools are excellent and have a very different atmosphere. But unless for some reason you fell in love with NYC and the Core curriculum at Columbia, it would make the most sense to go somewhere that on a whole, has a stronger engineering program and for you, is better financially, in my opinion.

wongtong:

a) statistics/surveys/rankings have truth behind them, but they are not in and of themselves true. they are part truths, half truths, and limited in scope, and therefore must not be treated as true. failure to do so is the reason that so many students attend schools that are bad for them.

b) just because you do not find columbia appealing or had a bad interaction all it says is that it is possible, but not universal. indeed something you find unappealing is something someone else might find very appealing.

c) columbia loses engineering admitted students mostly to hypsm, and not to top ranked state schools. this offers one possible answer: engineering specific reputation doesn't seem to be the only or in some cases the primary identification for students. and i can't tell you from the website, it is data i am privy to for being an awesome alum. if you came to columbia, i'd be happy to share it, but you went to cornell. either you trust it to be true, or you do not. i am very comfortable in the truth-claim i am making because i have seen the data with my own eyes. if you have seen or can prove data on your own, i welcome it.

d) rankings are heuristics that help us make decisions. but so are a whole number of things helpful. first the times (brit) rankings are interesting in their anglocentric bias (imperial being ranked above american schools is silly), but the also are highly disciplinarian and do not often support efforts done by schools like columbia that want to break disciplinary boundaries. if you are doing biogenomic research are you engineering, technology, or medical sciences? indeed classification problems are at the heart of ranking/survey/statistic issues and why they should be treated with skepticism.

e) rankings must be properly contextualized, and also calibrated to put into consideration a plethora of missing information. indeed no ranking can quantify experience, and it especially cannot predict experience. reasonable people could choose columbia for a multitude of reasons that would buck against the trend of rankings, but would be no less reasonable.

f) for us to properly weigh this issue even the OP is not an ideal candidate. the question to be asked would be if a student who is not from California is choosing between the two schools, would we consider the choice absurd if they went to columbia? of course not. so why is it absurd because the student is from cali. it is not.

further: it is not my goal to tell the OP to attend Cal. Indeed there are many people on this board and elsewhere that can do that. it is to present a simple argument for him and other readers about the silliness of relying on rankings to make absolute/universal declarations of what a student should do. further to indicate that columbia is still a reasonable choice if he/she really would like to attend. indeed it is a fantastic university that has taken me further than i could have ever imagined.

^ it's not just the ranking. Berkeley is cheaper for the OP...

Berkeley also is not just strong in engineering...Berkeley offers tremendous breadth and depth across the entire academic spectrum that only 2-3 universities can rival.

45.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
There are also unknown costs - what if UC-B continues its cuts in education? what if Governor Brown can't work out a deal? There are risks still with going to Berkeley even if to some individuals on this board it seems like it is a reasonable choice. Unknowns are always there.

And 2-3 universities that can rival are Harvard, Stanford and Columbia.

46.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
That's not going to change the fact that Berkeley will be cheaper to attend than Columbia for this particular poster.

They aren't talking about cuts in education...especially engineering. They're talking about getting efficient with overhead and reducing bureaucracy...something long needed at Cal. Out of distress comes opportunity. Berkeley will be stronger because of it...but it's not falling to some TTT.

Of course there's unknowns. NYC could get hit with a dirty bomb...who the **** knows!?
You have to go with knowns. Those are 1. Berkeley is cheaper. 2. Berkeley is better known for its engineering programs.

47.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
3. Columbia is the better undergraduate experience

48.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
That is highly subjective.

49.<<<confidentialcoll>>>
unless you have a strong reason to go Columbia, I would take UCB because of the money. A strong reason could be:

1) being dead set on finance / trading and want to make pots of money in the future (not that UCB excludes you from this, but Columbia places better)

2) Hate UCB and wouldn't do well / want to transfer / wouldn't be happy as an undergrad there

Failing that, UCB is a far cheaper so end this thread here.

I see I am a little bit late to this post. I am currently a PhD student in the chemical engineering department at UC Berkeley. Based on what I and other grad students have observed about the quality of the undergraduate program, I decided to start taking action to warn prospective undergraduate students not to heed the so-called US News "rankings" of undergraduate chemical engineering programs at elite schools. I also attended a "top ten" undergraduate program, but a slot or two lower than Berkeley according to US News. I can't remember what the order was when I started my PhD (it shuffles around).

Anyway, based on the US News ranking, and since I too had attended a large, public research institution as an undergraduate, I automatically assumed that the UCB program would be more difficult. I assumed even more math and computer knowledge would be required and applied in the courses. I assumed the workload would be invariably higher, the classes would be smaller, and the students would demonstrate a better understanding of the material on exams. In all, I was expecting to be wowed because I had always taken USNews rankings seriously. What I found as a GSI was stunningly the opposite. In chemical engineering MAJOR courses, there were still up to 100 students in a class. My major courses never exceeded 50, and were almost always around 30. The classes of 100 also only get 2 GSI's here. So since there isn't enough man power to assign and correct an adequate load of homework and a reasonable frequency of midterms (which I consider three per semester) with only 2 GSI's, the homework and exam load are drastically reduced- both in difficulty and quantity. There was only one mid term exam in the class I taught, and a staggering 2 homework problems were assigned per week. There was also a lab component to the class, which met for only 1.5 hours a week and no formal reports were required.

For purposes of comparison, the equivalent course at my undergraduate institution involved an average of 6-8 problems a week (I still have all my homeworks), three midterm exams, 6-8 hours of lab per week, formal reports on those labs (which average 10-15 pages each double spaced- I still have those too), and an end-of-semester project (which was 30 pages long in my case), in addition to the final exam.

So in summary, the difficulty and quantity of the work assigned to the UCB undergrads didn't even hold a candle to what I had. Thankfully though, I learned a great deal from the class, and since my tuition was a lot cheaper, I also got a lot more bang for my buck.
I am finally beginning to see why the grad students at places like MIT, Berkeley, and so-on, are dominated by graduates of Big-Ten engineering programs and UT Austin. The programs are tough- you won't have much free time. But you'll learn a lot more, you'll have a higher chance of getting into a top graduate program, and you'll probably get more job offers too (I had offers from Shell, Dow, Exxon, United Technologies, and Merck. Some of those places don't even recruit from elite schools).

In summary, if you are looking for a solid program from which you will learn a lot and land plenty of job offers and graduate school acceptance letters, AVOID chemical engineering programs at UCB, and elite schools in general (from what I have heard from the grad students in my department who attended them). You are getting cheated out of what the hard work you are capable of should be earning for you.

At first I was going to rage over you resurrecting a 2 month old thread, then I moderately appreciated the post, now I just have two comments:
[quote]In summary, if you are looking for a solid program from which you will learn a lot and land plenty of job offers and graduate school acceptance letters, AVOID chemical engineering programs at UCB, and elite schools in general[/quote]

1)This all depends on what you want to do with your degree. The fact of the matter is that most of the chem.e. grads from Columbia, Harvard, Yale,etc. won't continue chem.e. in any way. They'll go to med/law/b-schools or go into consulting/i-banking. An eng. degree with the liberal arts background of "elite" schools (minus MIT) will put you a leg up for these career paths compared to an eng degree from, say, Michigan.

2) Since chem.e.'s from "elite" schools tend to drop chem.e. after undergrad, it's plain to see why the graduate level is dominated by Big Ten-style eng. programs. Also, let's be honest here, graduate work in chemical engineering ALL OVER THE COUNTRY is dominated by Chinese nationals...
