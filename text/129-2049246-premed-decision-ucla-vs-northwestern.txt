Hi everyone, prospective premed student from the class of 2023 here. I recently was accepted into both UCLA and Northwestern as a New York resident and have fallen in love with both schools although I understand they’re very different. I understand they’re both great options but I was hoping to hear advice before I try and make a decision.
From what I gather, UCLA seems like an amazing school with a lot of opportunities but with so many kids and the curve on premed courses, I’m afraid competition for research and top grades will become toxic and cutthroat there. Nonetheless, I have a ton of research experience in high school and hopefully between Geffen and Ronald Reagan, I can find a lab or clinical experience. Northwestern has great advising and has a lot of resources for a smaller school, however, I know myself rather well and weather and atmosphere really affect my performance. I find it difficult to garner the motivation to keep the same energy when it’s snowing and I can’t see the sun for 5 months of a year (I know, I’m a New Yorker and it’s a struggle).
Pretty much in summary, I feel that my ceiling at UCLA is higher than it would be at Northwestern with the amount of opportunities on campus and in the greater LA area that I could take advantage of. However, I feel like my floor is higher at Northwestern and there’s less chance I’ll get swept away in the crowds of kids and a greater chance I get more personalized attention which could help my med school journey, even if I am a slightly weaker applicant in the process. Just wanted to get that out there and hear some thoughts from this amazing thread. Cheers.

I think that you understand your options.

Not a fan of paying OOS prices for a public – just not good value.  More importantly, premed at the top UC’s is brutally competitive.

If you can’t find similar opportunities in Evanston and ChiTown, you aren’t looking very hard.  
Go Wildcats!

@Sulley119 . . . This might be a bit offbeat; I don’t know where it’ll end up.
You’d love UCLA I have no doubt. And there’s quite a history for New Yorkers who have attended UCLA.  The New York Times pretty readily gives UCLA some really good pub, and they probably wouldn’t do this if there wasn’t interest in the University where its readership is especially strong. So even though they’re on opposite coasts, there’s an attraction, a strong attraction, that maybe belies – in the grand scheme of things – these two particles  and their pull towards each other, and they might as well be a universe away; certainly it’s not gravitational force; rather it’s probably astrology.
Well, maybe not…
We know it’s because of the weather as you mentioned. Weather breeds happy students and happy students breeds success. So I believe that the higher floor you mentioned at Northwestern – the University there pulling you up, could be duplicated at UCLA by your being happy.  Just as long as your happiness doesn’t lead you to spending long days at Zuma or Venice soaking up the rays and neglecting your studies.  You do sound very grounded, however.
There’s the finances which you didn’t mention. I don’t believe that if you can afford Northwestern, that UCLA wouldn’t be worth attending at full tuition. But at the same time, if your parents can use their Amex to pay the amount due, then I hope they can use it to pay the amount due at whatever medical school you attend.  I believe it’s got to be both, because otherwise, you probably should opt for a State University of New York campus.
You mentioned research.  By board rules – unwritten in my mind – I’ll link the life sciences at UCLA, their [Majors and Minors](https://lifesciences.ucla.edu/undergraduate/majors-minors/), but this might have to be the last time. You can attach a Biomedical Research minor to your likely life science major in the left-hand column, obviously very researchy. A couple of majors have [url=&lt;a href=“http://www.capstones.ucla.edu/lifesciences.htm%5Dcapstones%5B/url”&gt;http://www.capstones.ucla.edu/lifesciences.htm]capstones[/url], which is a senior project with a professor, very researchy.
You mentioned cutthroat but I still don’t think the premeds are that way; I think they’re more competitive and even collaborative.
You mentioned a curve; you could talk with students openly, and ask their opinions of whomever will be teaching whatever courses you need in a following quarter.  Be sure to avoid the gpa killers. Otherwise, apparently the curve is fairly generous.
You didn’t mention a fallback in case you have a hard time maintaining grades (edit:) in something like pure life science.  UCLA being on the quarter system allows one to take a greater breath of courses, and even major in something other than life sciences and concurrently take the core reqs for med school.
Other than these, maybe it’s been covered.
Stay well…

You do realized that Evanston and Chicago are attached right?  Seriously, your concern here is not realistic.

5 Thank you for the correction.  I just assumed that quarters were now just a California phenomenon.

10.<<<collegehuh>>>
Did you visit NW and UCLA to see and feel which one you like better?

11.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
Bad idea to go OOS to a UC as a Premed.   It’s practically practically suicidal to the Premed path.

12.<<<Hapworth>>>
The ground is littered with the bones of once-hopeful premed students, so the OP should attend whichever school is best for him/her in the long run.  As for paying OOS for a public university, it’s only a bad choice if the OP or the OP’s family cannot truly afford it.  If money is not really an issue, then UCLA is as fine a choice as any.

[/quote]

I hope you are not inferring that NU is inferior than UC Los Angeles?
But if your comment was more generic, then my answer is ‘depends on how inferior’.   I could easily make a case for a private school ~10 spots down the food chain over a public OOS; heck, I could make that case for a private over an (expensive) public at instate prices.  Not sure I’d feel the same if it was 50 spots down the food chain.
Private schools offer a whole bunch of other things – better housing, better advising, smaller classes, easier access to research opportunities, collegiality.  To me, it’s all about the value prop.
As mom2 notes above, premed at a top UC is brutal.  Gunners abound.  While OP is out enjoying the sunshine, there are literally hundreds of students holed up in labs and/or the library studying and restudying.

You don’t have to disparage the OP based on my comments, LOL. UCB, the poster, stated that curve brutality is overstated at Cal based on links provided.  It’s similarly overstated at UCLA, except for those professors who are gpa killers.  I looked at about 15 courses in the Life Sciences through Bruin Walk, and I noted that the curve was pretty generous except for those couple of professors.
@sulley119 , if you choose UCLA, be sure to obtain feedback on the individual courses you take beforehand and who teaches them.

Yes, I have long been aware of a more generous grading policy at Cal/UCLA over the ‘lesser’ UC and have frequently pointe that out to high schoolers when warranted…
But that’s not the point, which is that there are approx. There are ~6,200 Frosh at UCLA, of which approx. 25% (my estimate) are premed (1,500 premeds) all gunning for that A; few of those will make it thru the gauntlet to even apply to med school.   And I mean gunning.   Many of them already took Calc BC and aced it with a 5.  Ditto AP Chem and AP Bio.  All hoping for the ‘easy A’.
by gunners, I mean kids that start taking SAT prep classes as a Frosh/Soph in HS.

17.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Isn’t pre-med full of “gunners” everywhere?

Pretty much.

Re, bold #1:
I think that’d be too high a number, but if you would provide whatever backup you had, I’d be appreciative. It isn’t based on the number of posters here who are asking about premed at UCLA v. X v. Y… is it?
UCLA had just a hair under a 50% acceptance rate in 2018-19  – the total apps unfiltered, total and complete, without doctoring by the University for promotional purposes  – which is very good given the shear numbers that applied, 1,014. The fact that &gt; 1,000 made it to applying (from bac graduation over the current and previous cycles) shows that a good many are making it to the table.  And I don’t think their careers are done even in medicine by a rejection in the current term. About 1/4 of the students who apply are re-applicants. Additionally, 11% of USC Keck’s frosh are ≥ 26 years of age for the current cycle.
Re, bold #2:
I’d think the premed core would be the biggest determinant of med-school admission, so I would hope that they would know that calc isn’t factored in; then the factors expand out to overall gpa and of course the MCAT and interviews. That’s why I believe that premeds should possibly look to major in, say, French, or in whatever the student has an especially high aptitude, and concurrently take the core classes for an SOM.

I can’t tell you the number of UCLA students I’ve had drop my class because they’re pre-med and afraid they might get a B+ or A-. It’s pretty frustrating, and I worry about the mental health of some of my visibly stressed out students. Among other reasons, UCLA CAPS is woefully inadequate, and the university recently cut back the max number of visits from 10 to 6 per year.
UCLA is not an easy school, and that goes especially for anyone majoring in the sciences. Classes are getting larger, bureaucratic red tape is increasing, and the fast-paced quarter system means that you’ll stay behind if you fall behind. It’s possible to do well and get into a great graduate program or medical school, and many students do, but you have to stay on top of your work.

22.<<<CottonTales>>>
@ucbalumnus, there are gunners, but there are also schools who have a more collaborative environment. My D went to a school that was the latter, with a few outlier  gunners.

23.<<<crknwk2000>>>
@CottonTales can you share what school that is?

24.<<<CottonTales>>>
@crknwk2000, a tippy top LAC, and her now husband, also a Dr, went to a different tippy top LAC and had the same experience.

25.<<<firmament2x>>>
@warblersrule . . . thank you for your input.
Some questions if i may…
Regarding Quarters and Semesters.  Chancellor Gene Block characterized the Quarter System as a “failure,” in a recent student-newspaper article.
1a) I’m just curious as to what input and from whom has led him to believe this? He mentioned the lack of a reading period in quarters.  Is this all he has?
1b) Do you support the chancellor’s attempts at wanting to convert UCLA to the semester system?
1c) How does the academic senate, who has the most power, feel about this?  How difficult a transition would it be for the professors?
1d) Bottom line, how successful do you think it will be?  Or is it just the latest bluster without much support?
Regarding options for those who don’t get into med school.  UCLA baccalaureates have a little less than 50% chance of being accepted to med school according to the aamc.org data, of 1,014 who applied in the current, 2018-19 academic year  =&gt;  a little less than 500 who gained acceptances.  Of course these are unfiltered numbers.
2a) What do those who opt out of applying to med school do with a life-science degree if you have a feel for this? Or what have UCLA students been opting for once med school is out of the picture?

You mean this article? https://dailybruin.com/2019/04/02/chancellor-gene-block-supports-switching-ucla-to-semester-system/
https://dailybruin.com/2018/06/08/the-quad-the-long-convoluted-history-that-entrenches-the-quarter-system-at-ucla/ has some background information.
Basically, the entire UC system switched to quarters in 1966.  UCB changed back to semesters in 1983, while UCM opened in 2005 with the semester system.  Note that all but three of the over 100 California community colleges are on the semester system, and most of the CSUs are on the semester system.
Probably the unstated reason that many colleges prefer semesters is that administrative overhead is lower – need to do scheduling, registration, final exams, etc. twice per academic year instead of three times per academic year.  However, switching from one system to the other entails a large one-time cost for the switch.
But then both UCLA and Northwestern are on the quarter system, so that should not be a reason that makes one better than the other for any particular student.

27.<<<JenniferClint>>>
If money isn’t a factor you should definitely go to NU

28.<<<firmament2x>>>
@ucbalumnus . . . thank you.
I thought the first article was biased, but the second one which narrated the history of how quarters came to be at UC was especially bad.  Its author made it seem as if semester students had more time off during summer.  And not one proponent of the quarter system for balance.
In the first article, the history and labor relations professor, Tobias Higbie, says:
“Syllabi are set. Approaches to teaching are geared to the 10 week quarter,” Higbie said. “That said, I think after a few years of trial and error we would make it work and get the benefits of the semester system.”
They’ll make it work after a few of years?.  What about the students who have to put up with the missteps and the problems in the adjustment period?
It’s clear to me that the chancellor is just trying to coddle the students.
I remembered after I wrote the part of the advantages of UCLA being on quarters with students being able to take a greater breath of classes that I realized that Northwestern was on the same system. I believe this would be good for the OP or anyone’s learning.

29.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
The quarter system can, in theory, allow a college to have year-round enrollment, allowing it to enroll a larger number of students if students have their “off” quarters evenly distributed (instead of concentrated in the summer).  Dartmouth tries to move slightly in this direction with its D-plan (where students’ 12 quarters on campus typically include at least one summer quarter), although it is nowhere close to a full implementation of that.  But traditional patterns of college enrollment seem to be too strong to break, so that this theoretical advantage of the quarter system does not exist.

30.<<<firmament2x>>>
@ucbalumnus . . . It’d be tough to tell students in any way that they are required to take a summer term. What about the motivation of graduating early and saving scads of cash?  This can be just a rhetorical question, so don’t feel compelled to answer.
Edit: I got you, belatedly.  The brass at UC implemented quarters to keep the university running year round.

31.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
“I find it difficult to garner the motivation to keep the same energy when it’s snowing and I can’t see the sun for 5 months of a year (I know, I’m a New Yorker and it’s a struggle).”

32.<<<privatebanker>>>
I think UCLA is great. I think Northwestern is great.  And for some students, Northwest Illinois is great.
OP.  You will find gunners everywhere. You will find caring and collaborative students at both schools too.  You’ll have good weather and bad weather at both. You’ll have hard classes at both, with tough curves and not.
You’ll “find your tribe” and then maybe one or two more.
You will be able create special bonds with similar super smart students and you’ll run into a few dummies like me. But despite what you hear, they won’t keep you enjoying the “life of the mind” or whatever it is you are looking for in the next four years.
You may end up becoming a Dr. attending either college or figure out a different path.
The world of absolutes on CC and “best” does not exist in the real world. There are too many variables.
Make an educated decision and do the best you can, work hard, be a nice person and let the chips fall where they may.
It’s not as though it’s become a doc or end up in a coal mine. Lol.
And I still don’t understand the CC official list of hierarchical absolutes anyway.
Where does “tippy top” begin and end? Does “top” start where that list ends or is it already second tier at that point. And does “elite” cover “tippy top”, “top”, as well as the non “tippy top” second tier that may fall under “prestigious”. And where does that end.
And are these levels of exclusivity chiseled into the granite cliffs of college choice for time immemorial?
What does one use as their source material for this knowledge -USNWR, Forbes, Niche, Poets and Quants, Princeton review, Schools that change lives, WSJ, international rankings or domestic only, salary surveys- old or new depending on results, Frank Bruni, Fortune 100 CEO stats, PhD applications per 100, or the dozens of other guides? They change every year.
UCLA was the number one public university  in America according to usnwr . Is that tippy top, top, second tier, elite or prestigious? Many international rankings have Cal as number one. Or is that too grad school oriented.
This is all very silly to dissect levels of excellence, once you’ve achieved excellence. Some like Monet. Some like Renoir. Both are great.
Northwestern and UCLA are both wonderful and challenging environments. Everyone has an environment that will suit them better than others. Choose yours and best of luck.

33.<<<crknwk2000>>>
So very well put, but this should be no surprise since for me you are always the voice of measured reason @privatebanker …
Cheers and thanks for always putting things into very real, sane perspective.

34.<<<StanfordGSB00>>>
@Sulley119 - Both are great schools. I would recommend Northwestern because it is more exclusive / elite at the undergraduate level. Most students at UCLA cannot get into Northwestern or  a top 10-12 private except maybe the top 10-20%. Top 10 in USNews vs. Top 25. And now to SAT / ACT scores, Northwestern has had significantly higher scores for many many years compared to UCLA. About a 150 point difference in SAT average. 150 points - not 15 points. That is significant. And it is not just about test scores when it comes to exclusive, elite admissions - Harvard could enroll a class with a 1600 perfect SAT average. They are looking for very talented, unique individuals. Northwestern / Duke / Dartmouth, Stanford, etc. could similarly enroll a class with a 1550 SAT average if they wanted to but UCLA could not.
Go look at the RD decisions threads for these schools and you’ll see a ton of students with 1500+ SAT scores / 34+ ACT scores (with perfect grades) rejected on the regular. The one thing I would also mention coming from the Northeast is that UCLA out of state is way more competitive for admission than it is in-state. So, if you plan to remain in the northeast, I don’t think your peers or future colleagues will be as impressed with the degree as you may think. Also, UCLA has transfer agreements set up with many local community colleges, such as Santa Monica Community, where a lot of students are able to back-door their way into UCLA & UCB after 2 years of community college by just obtaining a required GPA (no standardized test score is even needed). At the majority of other super selective schools (like Northwestern), transfer admission is extremely competitive because of (1) high retention / graduation rates and (2) lack of guaranteed transfer admission programs. You obviously worked really hard to get to this point - I think you will be surrounded by more like-minded students at Northwestern. There are definitely some brilliant students at UCLA but the average UCLA student will be weaker academically than his/her counterpart at Northwestern. That is a FACT.
Unless $$ is a big concern, why would you go to a large public school (which is still awesome but not quite the same level as NU) when you can go an elite private school with more resources, a higher caliber student body, smaller classes, and an overall better reputation. Not to mention, the recruiting opportunities coming out of Northwestern are far superior to those at UCLA, if you (like thousands of students) changes from pre-med to something else. NU is a top target for all of the top consulting companies (Bain, McKinsey, BCG, Oliver Wyman) and a target for major bulge-bracket investment banks. UCLA is not. So, even career opportunities will be better coming out of Northwestern. If you decide to pursue pre-med, NU is a better option because there will be significantly more research opportunities available to you because research funding is significantly higher per capita at NU than UCLA. NU’s endowment (top 10) is significantly larger than UCLA’s even though it is a much smaller university at the undergraduate level. Also, pre-med advising at NU will be better compared to UCLA’s where you can easily get lost in the crowd. The percentage of students accepted into medical school from NU exceeds 80% - I could not found that stat for UCLA but there is no way it is even close to that number. So, your chances of getting into medical school are higher from Northwestern.
There is also less competition for coveted internships / full time jobs (if you change your path) since the student body is significantly smaller at Northwestern and the recruiting opportunities (per capita) is greater. It is also extremely easy to switch in/out of schools and not have to worry about getting into certain courses, etc. UCLA, UCB, UMichigan and UVA alums will disagree here but if money is not a factor, 95% of students are choosing NU over UCLA and the equivalent top public, UNLESS $$$ is a big consideration and you are in-state. A lot of students go into college thinking they want to be doctors and then change their minds. Northwestern provides the flexibility to do that and excel regardless of the path you take. Good luck and congrats on the acceptances.

They do not want to because they reserve a large portion of their class for applicants with special preferences and privileges (legacy, donation, athlete, URM – all except URM correlate to coming from a more privileged background than the typical applicants to those schools, and URMs at those schools tend to come from more privileged backgrounds than URMs on average).

TAG is not available for UCB and UCLA; all transfer applicants apply into a competitive admission process.  TAG admission by meeting a certain college GPA is available at some of the other UC campuses.  In any case, you seem quite disdainful about transfer students from community college, who are more likely to have come from unprivileged backgrounds and therefore had to personally earn a greater portion of their merits and achievements, rather than take advantage of a privileged upbringing with the most opportunities to earn merit, and unearned preferences like legacy and donation to get into a desired college.  Some of the private schools you would probably be impressed with have a similar view on what kinds of transfer students to admit, although they admit only small numbers of transfer students overall.

Let me cut to the chase and present a superscored SAT for UCLA.  the backup is [url= &lt;a href=“https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/2138131-help-me-decide-between-ucla-cal-berkeley-duke-and-northwestern-for-economics-math-p4.html%5Dhere%5B/url”&gt;https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/2138131-help-me-decide-between-ucla-cal-berkeley-duke-and-northwestern-for-economics-math-p4.html]here[/url], posts 56 and 57 with a correction.  I’d be appreciative if you’d answer, thank you.
Let me proceed to adjust for superscores of the following:
………SAT……………………25th…………………50th…………………75th
………Northwestern…………1,430……………….1,490………………1,550
………UCLA…………………1,340……………….1,430………………1,530 (adjusted to superscore)
…………GPA…………………Average……………Median
…….Northwestern……………N/A………………N/A (Northwestern does not provide gpa on CDS)
……UCLA……………………3.89………….….3.95 (Unweighted)
To add to what UCB stated, UCLA and Cal accept in the low 20% range from community college.  The average xfer gpa from community college to both would be: 3.77-3.80.  The CS major for both Cal and UCLA have a 25th/75th Percentile gpa of 3.90/4.00; Haas, 3.84/4.00; UCLA Bus/Econ, 3.86/4.00; Econ Cal, 3.83/4.00, UCLA 3.78/4.00

37.<<<firmament2x>>>
@ucbalumnus . . .
I didn’t know that there was such a strong International presence in transfers to many of the UC campuses.  UCSD and SB had higher percentages, 17-18%, than UCLA and Cal, 16-17%, for 2018-19.
I guess this makes sense, since this way, Internationals are more readily able to prove English proficiency or maybe to gain it at community college.  Does this mean that they could prove proficiency by taking classes here, rather than by the tests?  I’m guessing that perhaps this was what could have been holding them back from entering as freshmen, besides the fact that the acceptance rates into especially Cal and UCLA would be even lower for foreign students than for the other students, in-staters and out-of-staters. Edit: But might the lower rates have been because some lacked English proficiency?

38.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
A while back, I emailed Northwestern asking for med school placement stats and it was around 80%. You should ask NU what the stats is these days.

39.<<<CottonTales>>>
@IWannaHelp, it has been stated many times here on CC, medschools manipulate their Medschool admissions stats in many ways. For any top schools, published medschool admission rates are basically meaningless. Just because a school says their Medschool placement rate is 80% does NOT mean those will be your odds. I haven’t looked lately, but I think it is about 40%. @WayOutWestMom is the medschool stats guru, I’m sure she can provide accurate info.

But that’s not the point, which is that there are approx.

And I mean gunning. Many of them already took Calc BC and aced it with a 5. Ditto AP Chem and AP Bio. All hoping for the ‘easy A’.

I’m guessing the number is actually higher than 1500 frosh premeds at UCLA.  UCLA has 1000 students apply each year to med school.
There are definitely gunners at UCLA.  Poor advising and no Committee Letters.
NU has about 230 students apply to med schools each year.  Go there.

I hate that word “placement”.  It’s not as if the univ is “placing” a student into med school.  Acceptance rate isn’t a much better term due to the frequent manipulation.   And whatever the stat is, it has nothing to do with any particular incoming freshman premed.  And the UCs do have a very low acceptance rate into med school.
That said, simply the ridiculousness that exists in Calif (premeds vs med school seats), it’s just a bad idea for an OOS premed student to go to Calif…particularly one that couldn’t possibly provide adequate advising when it has 1000 students applying to med schools every year.  They don’t do Committee Letters simply because they lack the resources.
NU has the advising, the CLs, etc.  this is such a no-brainer.

Between hard weeding in the intro science classes and NU’s use of a committee letter to control whom they’ll allow to apply to med, that “success rate” for NU students is highly manipulated.
Every undergrad manipulates its med school success rates to show their stats in the best light possible.
Nationally, ~65000 student took the MCAT last year, ~55,000 applied and  ~21000 of them got a med school acceptance. So less than 1/3 of the pre meds who have persisted throng undergrad get a med school acceptance and only ~39% of those who apply to med school get an acceptance.

A while back, I emailed Northwestern asking for med school placement stats and it was around 80%. You should ask NU what the stats is these days.

IWannaHelp, it has been stated many times here on CC, medschools manipulate their Medschool admissions stats in many ways. For any top schools, published medschool admission rates are basically meaningless. Just because a school says their Medschool placement rate is 80% does NOT mean those will be your odds. I haven’t looked lately, but I think it is about 40%. WayOutWestMom is the medschool stats guru, I’m sure she can provide accurate info.

@IWannaHelp and @CottonTales:
The rate of acceptance (% of all applicants with ≥ 1 SOM acceptance/all who applied) for all baccalaureate-degree holders across the nation for the current academic year 2018-19 was 41%.
Regarding what you stated, CottonTales, here’s an honest writeup by the Health Professions advisor at Santa Clara University and here’s the [link](https://www.scu.edu/pre-health/admission-statistics/):

[quote]
In the end, the effectiveness of a pre-health program is reflected in the medical school admissions statistics for our Santa Clara University graduates.  So how do we stack up?  Since 2002, over 90% SCU pre-medical graduates have achieved admission to at least one U.S. allopathic medical school if they graduated with 1) an overall gpa &gt; 3.50, 2) an MCAT score of 30 or higher, (this translates roughly to the 505-510 range or higher on the new scale), 3) a nice portfolio of experiential activities, and 4) if they took off at least one year between SCU graduation and medical school matriculation.  In other words, if they were qualified, they got in.  As University Pre-Health Advisor I have no say as to whether a given student chooses to apply to medical school.  Students with very non-competitive applications may still choose to apply.  Overall, about 40% of our students who apply get in.  So is the statistic 100% or 40%?  It’s both, depending on the pool of students examined.  Data is similar for all the other graduate health programs to our graduates apply; dental school, pharmacy, physical therapy, etc.

Here’s a [url=&lt;a href=“https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/california-colleges/2134202-pomona-college-vs-ucla-vs-cal.html%5Dlink%5B/url”&gt;https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/california-colleges/2134202-pomona-college-vs-ucla-vs-cal.html]link[/url] to a discussion some of us had revolving around Pomona College (“Pomona”), the University of California, Berkeley (“Cal”), and the University of California, Los Angeles (“UCLA”).  The OP in that thread has intentions of attending medical school with the listed universities as his/her college options.  To cut through the superfluity, posts #27 through #37 finally arrive at the matter at hand with respect to the OP and proceeds to the med-school admissions for all three.
A gentleman involved in the conversation apparently was able to access the matriculant numbers from the AAMC via his son who is a graduate of Pomona and attends or attended med school.  Aamc.org has the applicant numbers from each university to m-school, but it doesn’t release specific matriculant numbers to the public, presumably because of misuse.  He presented the acceptance figures for all three: Pomona, 76%; Cal, 46%; and UCLA, 49%. (I’m sure there are variable percentages depending on the year.) He was able to eventually match the applicant numbers to the aamc’s: 72, 662, and 1,014, as mom2collegekids states below.

I’m guessing the number is actually higher than 1500 frosh premeds at UCLA. UCLA has 1000 students apply each year to med school [in response to a previous post by bluebayou].
There are definitely gunners at UCLA. Poor advising and no Committee Letters.
NU has about 230 students apply to med schools each year. Go there.
[/quote]

Your second sentence is faulty by reason of the first.  It may be true, but the applicants to med school in a particular year are not exclusive of a prior cycle of baccalaureate graduates, which you doubtlessly know. (I’ll leave the door open because I’d like you to respond.)
I don’t believe your first point is true within the bold.  There is University-based counseling and secondary-based mentorships for those who are pre-health.  There are student groups which have meetings and fairs. The idea that “[p]oor [pre-health professions] advising” is prevalent throughout the UCs, is something that apparently circulates throughout this board and it is taken as truth without any kind of corroborative evidence whether it is true.
Re, Committee Letters…
Here’s a [url=&lt;a href=“http://www.savvypremed.com/savvy-pre-med/2016/2/15/every-question-you-have-about-letters-of-recommendation-for-medical-school-1#3%5Dlink%5B/url”&gt;http://www.savvypremed.com/savvy-pre-med/2016/2/15/every-question-you-have-about-letters-of-recommendation-for-medical-school-1#3]link[/url] from savvypremed.com about them, and here’s a snippet:

[quote]
What’s A Committee Letter?
A committee letter, or composite letter, is written by the pre-med advising office of your college or university.  Not every college offers such a letter, and a quick glance at your career services website should answer whether your school does.
Should I get a committee letter?
If you have the option, then yes, you probably should.  Think of the committee letter as Yelp.  Sure, you might try a restaurant that has no reviews, but you’d probably be more interested in eating at a restaurant with 4.5 stars.
So that analogy isn’t perfect, but I think you get the point: it’s better to get a committee letter if you can.  If you don’t, med schools might wonder whether there’s something you’re trying to hide or whether you were told by the committee that they didn’t think you were a strong candidate.
There are dozens of exceptions to this rule:
• Some colleges don’t offer committee letters to non-science majors
• Some colleges don’t offer committee letters to alums
• Some colleges have several additional hoops you have to jump through that may make you ineligible to get a committee letter
The takeaway: Get a committee letter if you can, but it won’t ruin your chances if you can’t.
[/quote]

In another part it states that there are doubtlessly Letters of Recommendations that are needed to apply to med schools, varying from three to five.  A Committee Letter is not one of these.  Those who attend universities that provide them should obtain them; those that don’t are obviously not beholden to them and would have to obtain all the rec-letters from others. (Edit: Remove end quote.)

[/quote]

Perhaps the UCs don’t present CLs, because they are worried about incurring liability.
Re, bold… no it doesn’t.  The rate of acceptance for all who apply nationwide is 41%; for UCLA and Cal it’s closer to 50% and the total for all UCs I would guess would be &gt; than the national average.  One has to remember, these are unfiltered numbers, and SCU’s rate according to the pre-health advisor is ~ 40% (well it is in CA).
I would guess that there is a downward trend in acceptances around the country because apparently more are applying.  So your idea that “UCLA has 1000 students apply each year to med school” is not accurate. I’m not sure when it surpassed that figure, but it’s only fairly recently that it has. Again, applications appear to be rising; we’ll just have to track the &gt; 21,000 applications that have occurred in the current cyle to see if they increase.
With respect to the colleges with the best rates of acceptance, I would suspect that Harvard baccalaureates would have ~ 90% rate or greater, because there would be a lot of SOMs which would love to have a Harvard grad or two in its freshman class.  Additionally, Harvard grads represent all 50 states (i.e., it will have a wider distribution among all of them) which implies that the University would not be bogged down by regionality.  UC grads who apply to med school generally self-impose regionality with specificity to California.  Most UC grads who do attend will be doing so outside of CA, but their desire typically is one of the UC SOMs firstly, the CA SOMs secondly, and then everywhere else thirdly, maybe with an added regionality to stay in the west mixed in.
And sorry if my post has numerous flaws, including probable disjointed addressing of references, but I’ve been trying to multitask.

Um…not to put a damper on the discussion, but has anyone else noticed that the OP hasn’t returned to this thread since she/he posted on 4/13?

[/quote]

Yep, I’ve noticed it every time, because the number of posts below OP’s sig would have updated past one if he/she had done so elsewhere.
But that’s okay, because some of us need(ed) to hash out some disagreements: e.g., are Committee Letters needed for med school; and is UC, or in this case and in any case, UCLA, a very bad place to be a pre-med?
Edit add: Committee Letters can also be “suicide” as mom2collegekids would state things if a bad letter is generated.
What some choose to ignore is the fact that the OP, as originally stated, is looking to keep his or her health in college by looking for a place that has, say, balmy weather.
