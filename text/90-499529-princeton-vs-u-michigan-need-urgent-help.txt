1.<<<dad81>>>
My son prefer UM.

2.<<<georgiamom>>>
Was he able to attend Preview Days at P?

3.<<<dad81>>>
He did attend the Preview.

4.<<<sang54>>>
Princeton. Michigan is a fantastic school, but Princeton is Princeton.

5.<<<patlees88>>>
definitely Princeton. It seems like they are offering pretty generous fin aid too. Can't get any better than that.

6.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
Your son will get more "care and feeding" at Princeton vs. Michigan. IMO, since he got into Princeton he should go...especially because the family can afford it.

But, if he's more comfortable at Michigan, it's a fantastic school and he'll do well no matter what he chooses.

7.<<<aworldapart>>>
Let's look at the facts. Your son is looking to turn down arguably the best school in the country because he has a GF at UM and he "needs a break"? Those reasons aren't good enough to turn down Princeton.

8.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
Heh, his GF can brag that her BF is studying at Princeton...it will elevate her reputation as well...;)

9.<<<JP_Omnipotence>>>
dad81, why do you want him to go to princeton? He attended the preview days at princeton, and evidently didn't like what he saw. If he's going to be happier at another school, then why not let him go there (especially if it's cheaper for you)?

The fact that Umich counts APs is a big deal, and maybe your son would rather be near the top of the pack and have a semi-easy life. Besides, if he's going to grad school, the prestige of his undergrad won't matter so much, and he'll be much more successful in an environment he is comfortable with.

10.<<<keefer>>>
Princeton is a more prestigious school. But, the so called "easier life" at Michigan, I would beg him to think again. It'll be just as hard at Michigan if he's doing Engineering/Science/Math.

But, this isn't a no name school vs. Princeton, it's Michigan. If he really likes Michigan, then he should go, especially given that he's saving $24k for you.

11.<<<brassmonkey>>>
Your son should NOT let a high-school romance be the determining factor in the biggest decision of his life. That having been said, he really can't go wrong with either option. Just make sure he is making the "right" choice for the "right" reason

12.<<<dad81>>>
Patlees88, Yes. That's what I learned from his application. Good schools alway give better financial package. It is not smart if he turns down this opportunity.

13.<<<dad81>>>
aworldapart,

I totally agree with you. But he believes that "break" and "GF" are so important to him and they will not come back. The "break" he get in the future will be different from what he get when he is 18.

What should I do?

14.<<<fatladysings>>>
Kids are under so much pressure these days that it's not a big surprise when they are desperate for a break. Fortunately, he has a choice of two top schools although people will definitely be more impressed with Princeton, if that should matter to you.
One possibility is that you might offer him the choice of taking a year off to do something different-- an internship or gap year program. Princeton actively encourages students to do this.
On a side note, my friend's daughter goes to Princeton. She arrived an enthusiastic scientist and dropped science like a hot rock after her first year because of the "eat their young" atmosphere. I didn't even let my daughter apply because of that-- it's her passion and I didn't want it drilled out of her. So maybe your son is on to something?

15.<<<dad81>>>
JP_Omnipotence,

He had UM campus visit before he went P. After he came back from UM and met the girl there (3 days) he told me that UM is his school. I asked him to visit P and I know he will have bad impressions about P.

I think his decision is not a smart one.

16.<<<danas>>>
As a thought experiment, I've recently been wondering what a Princeton admission would sell for on EBay.
I bet the contrast with Michigan would be stark.

17.<<<dad81>>>
Thanks, Keefer, He will choose engineering and science. I will tell him that P will be just as hard at Michigan

18.<<<dad81>>>
fatladysings,

Thank you for your suggestion. I will talk with him to see if he wants such internships.

19.<<<GoBlue81>>>
I can see going to Michigan to take advantage of the immense resources. An aspiring student has the opportunity to take graduate courses and do cutting edge research with the best profs in his field.

Needing a break or an easy life in college are wrong reasons for choosing Michigan (if these are indeed his real reasons). He will get lost in the big U.

20.<<<dad81>>>
GoBlue81,

That's what I am worrying about. If he has this kind of "break" attitude, he probably will get lost in a big University with huge undergraduate population. On the other side, a small university, like HPY, has the resources to prevent it happening.

21.<<<Alexandre>>>
Princeton is one of the nation's top 5 universities, Michigan is one of the nation's top 10 or top 15 universities. If he prefers Michigan to Princeton, he should go there. It's not like Princeton will offer him a better education or a better future.

This said, there are three, maybe four universities that I would pick over Michigan, and Princeton happens to be one of them (MIT, Stanford and maybe Harvard are the other two or three schools). But fit is very important. I would pick Michigan over Yale in a heartbeat. If your son does not like Princeton and has the option of attending another top 10 or top 15 university, so be it.

22.<<<DunninLA>>>
wow, I agree those are two really lousy reasons to pick UM over Princeton. Not that it's a bad rational choice. UM is very strong in engineering, so he could conceivably end up with the right choice for the wrong reason!

I recommend he takes a year or a semester off from school. I'm sure he has been grinding for four straight years.

Your son has more problems than which school to attend... the "break" is merely a surface issue that underlies his dissatisfaction with the GRIND.

At least he's being honest with you. Good for him.

P.S. My neighbor was accepted to Berkeley in engineering three years ago... but for 2nd semester matriculation. He traveled in the US, then three months in Australia, then came back to start at Berkeley. He was ready for Berkeley by then, and has done really well, top of the class, and an RA to boot. I think kids work SOOOO hard in high school these days that it is a very good idea to take a 6-9 month break before starting another HAAARD four years.

23.<<<DunninLA>>>
fatladysings --

Interesting to hear about the super intense atmosphere of science majors at Princeton. That I can assure you is very different from Stanford, UCLA, but sounds about like UC Berkeley's premed weed-out progression.

Sounds like OP's son is not pre-med, but engineering. I'll bet there isn't the same weed-out there.

24.<<<tokyorevelation9>>>
I'm a natural sciences major at Princeton (Ecology &amp; Evol. Bio), and it really depends on the department for the super-intense weed-out factor, but it definitely exists. The biggest culprits are the Maths, Physics, Mol. Bio, and Astrophysics departments. These departments are heavily based on performance inside and outside the classroom, and often professors will very forthrightly tell students of their shortcomings and say "Maybe this department isn't for you." This is not as much of a problem in Chemistry, Psychology, and EEB, but it really depends upon what you intend to do later on.

As for the SEAS (School of Engineering &amp; App. Science), many people drop out of that program and switch to the A.B. because there are considerable extra requirements for B.S.E's (mainly having to take 6 courses a semester, 5 if you are a freshman). However, B.S.E's also don't have to take a foreign language, or write a senior thesis. Go figure. I actually think many departments in SEAS, including Chem E. Elec. E, Mech./Aerospace E, and Civil/Environmental E. are more attentive to students because these departments are by virtue of being in a smaller program, smaller. Therefore, DunninLA is right to say there is much less of a weed-out in SEAS, but it is definitely not a cake-walk, for sure.

25.<<<DunninLA>>>
thank you for that input tokyorevelation9

26.<<<dad81>>>
DunninLA,

thank you for your reasonable analysis about my son's situation.

27.<<<dad81>>>
tokyorevelation9,

Thank you for your input. Do you have any details about the school load of the engineering majors? My son had 9 APs in junior and got most 5s he has 6 Aps this year. I think he can handle it. But he thought it will be very difficult for him to survive after he visited P and talked with a engineering host student. Is that hard?

28.<<<tokyorevelation9>>>
As I said in my earlier post, B.S.E students have to take 6 courses/semester in order to have enough credits to graduate (5/semester for freshmen). This is one more course per semester than A.B. students. Also, engineers have a good deal of other requirements, especially in maths and the natural sciences (some of which are not recommended to be placed out by AP credit).

However, the flipside is they <b> don't have to take a foreign language or do a senior thesis </b> (although many do a large research project as a senior).

It is highly possible that the host student your son met has an exceptionally heavy courseload because he is working on a certificate in another area as well, or he is just taking very advanced courses. Or he could just be taking a subject or two to which he doesn't have a natural talent.

One word of advice...<u> do not let your son rely on AP placement </u>, especially as a freshman in the hard sciences. It is a common occurrence that students end up WAY over their heads and opt (or plead uncle) to take the lower course. This happens especially to freshmen who get 5's on the AP Chemistry exam and decide to take organic chem their freshman fall. Bad, bad idea, not just because its a tough course, but they haven't formulated a good study schedule and strategy for intensive laboratory courses like orgo, and if he's not ridiculously diligent, the stress will hit like the Orient Express.

Just a word to the wise.

29.<<<dad81>>>
tokyorevelation9.

Thank you so much. I will take your advice into consideration.

30.<<<danas>>>
tokyorevelation9 has provided more detail than I possibly could. But I would like to provide a general observation as the parent of a first year Princeton student.
It is more than possible to be the acknowledged star (in science or other subjects) in your high school and fall to the bottom half in the same subject at Princeton. Half do, after all.
When I visited Princeton with my daughter, we talked to a student who was an astrophysics major. He quickly realized that he would be a mediocre contributor to his hoped for profession and changed his plans.
I have a good friend who was a Physics major at Amherst. In an advanced course of 5 students, he quickly realized he was, in his own words, the "stupidest" in the class. He changed his plans and is now a neo-natal intensive care pediatric MD at the University of Chicago. And a terrific one.
The culture at Princeton, from what I can figure out, is not to "eat their young". It's just that most us will realize that there are others smarter (sometimes much smarter) than we are.

31.<<<UCLA, Ph.D.>>>
sorry fatladysings "Kids are under so much pressure these days" blah blah blah. The kids fighting in Iraq are under pressure not to mention kids in Iraq. So give me a break with that. I think this is where parents have to be parents and stop relinquishing authority to their children.....

First of all, there is a 99% chance the GF will be gone by 1st semester, in fact if you find the thread; kids on this site talk about this. Secondly, what is he talking about a "break"? Take that break over the summer pal. Again you think kids in Iraq are taking a "break." It seems this sense of entitlement is something that afflicts way too many children. It definitely speaks to a lack of maturity. 3) Keefer is RIGHT ON POINT. You think life at a major institution is going to be easier pal? Get back to me when you are having trouble and trying to get access to a professor who has 300 other students in his/her class. Michigan is not a chumpy little state school, it is Michigan and like my institution (check my name) it is sink or swim. You are going to need to hustle to get courses you want, hustle to get through the bureacracy and hustle to see an overburdened professor who is going to try and pass you off on a T.A. who may or may not speak English you can understand (that is not a knock on international students it is a complaint amongst students however). So he is obviously delusional about an "easier" time at Michigan. Having said all this he is not going to be coddled like he would be at Princeton, where you can actually have dinner with your professors on a weekly basis. Why do you think Ivy students matriculate so well? They get the best of resources in every way! Access to faculty, grad students serve as their TUTORS not their TA's, free food at every social event on campus!

His decision is not a smart one it is a selfish one, which gets me to my final point. He needs to know this isn't just about him. It is about all the hard work his parents did to put him in this position. It would be selfish and a disappointment to not honor that.

Grow up and go to Princeton.

My friend was going through the same crap with her son, fortunately he made the right choice

32.<<<tokyorevelation9>>>
...and that's my cue to exit stage left *tappity tap tap*

UCLA, Ph.D.
Thanks for your input. I sent a private message to you.

34.<<<UCLA, Ph.D.>>>
Good Luck Dad81

35.<<<DunninLA>>>
dad81 and UCLA, Ph.D. -

While I acknowledge the need for kids understand the realities of life, to let go of a sense of entitlement, and to work hard from an early age, it's all about balance, and each individual kid's emotional strength.

dad81, your son has worked much, much harder than most kids, as evidenced by his ridiculously difficult course load the past three years. It is possible to emotionally burn out. While his intellect is going full guns, it is writing checks his emotional health may not be able to cash. I'm not saying he has burnt out, but burnout is a part of life and is not something to be taken lightly. If he is truly burnt out, and there is no break scheduled, he could suffer an emotional breakdown.

UCLA, Ph.D. - do you acknowledge the social sciences of psychology and sociology? Do you side with Tom Cruise or Brooke Shields (Princeton, btw) around the issue of her post partum depression? Reason I ask is that your penultimate post sounds as intolerant as Tom Cruise's statements about psychologists.

36.<<<DunninLA>>>
If you have read my posts, you would see that I attended Stanford and was waitlisted at Yale. At the time I didn't know about the LACs. I've learned about them from fellow grad students and employees over the years.

37.<<<UCLA, Ph.D.>>>
My bad, I don't have an obsession hunting down people I disagree with and reading all their posts so I can refute all their points.

38.<<<DunninLA>>>
Good, I don't like being the object of obsessions! And I also attended UCLA.

39.<<<UCLA, Ph.D.>>>
"And I also attended UCLA."

Then you should know better.

40.<<<brillar>>>
I completely agree with UCLA up to this point:

"He needs to know this isn't just about him. It is about all the hard work his parents did to put him in this position. It would be selfish and a disappointment to not honor that."

That's CRAZY. I had my mom read it and she didn't even agree! It's his life, it's his time to make his own mistakes. Yes, he has pretty terrible reasons to go to UM (there are MUCH better reasons out there), but that doesn't give a parent the right to make decisions for him the rest of his life. He needs to decide what job he'll take, where he'll live, who he'll marry- that's all part of life, and it starts with this decision. I'm ALL FOR someone sitting down with him and saying that he shouldn't make his decision on those two reasons (guess what? There are plenty of hot girls at Pton too!), but in the end, the decision should be his.

Talk with him, don't force him, and don't say he's being selfish (I know you didn't say that, Dad81)- but BOTH are great schools and even if he is picking one for the wrong reasons, and is maybe making the wrong decision, he's the one that will "suffer the consequences."

41.<<<etcheverry>>>
Let your son decide..I did what my parents told me to do..what happened?i'm 23 years old and starting from zero again..i drop out from a prestigious eng. university in my home country.I did because i couldn't take it anymore..i listened to my parents instead of my heart..
One thing that i agree is that a girl should never be a reson for anything..too many beautiful girls in college..he will always find one he likes...

42.<<<etcheverry>>>
Just adding something..I see people saying Princeton is hard..I don't wanna be rude but american High school is a joke..getting A's is very easy...just because a student has perfect GPA at HS doesn't mean the he will get good great at a good university..I have a friend who was top 5% of his clas perfect gpa and went to a top 20 university and enf up getting C's D's...
I would take 6 months off because once college life hit him he better be prepared.

43.<<<Alumother>>>
Princeton just is not "eat-your-young". It's hard, but it's not brutal. Not even close.

However, it is quite possible that stars in high school are just average at Princeton. My D was a high school math star. She got to Princeton, placed into a 200-level class, and was surprised.

Her take? She wasn't going to be the best molecular biologist or mathematician out there. But she's loving neuroscience....and providing value as someone who bridges the quantitative and qualitative worlds for behavioral studies.

But the school itself? Boy, I wish people were half as nice to me day to day as that school is to my kid....

Don't let your son choose UM for a girl. But, if he is telling you he needs time off, Princeton announced a new program to support this. Maybe that will solve both of your requirements.

44.<<<Relampago>>>
I agree with Alumother and UCLA, PhD. I am sorry I agree that parents give up way too much control in this process (and in a lot of other things in this country). The Iraq reference is sooooo true. Perspective.

45.<<<brillar>>>
I think parents should have more control if they're the ones paying the extra 10K or whatever, but when money isn't an issue like this... I don't know.

Relampago! Both of us have Spanish word names! Although I admit, yours is better and people are probably less likely to pronounce it oddly. Usually people pronounce the ll as an l and it reminds me of that brillo sponge.

46.<<<Relampago>>>
Brillar---HAHA. Yeah I get that with my real name! Well not brillo sponge, but it is butchered nonetheless.

47.<<<midatlmom>>>
If I'm reading this right, the OP's son met a girl on campus at Michigan recently and decided he liked her.

I think that conversations about these types of things can be very difficult between parent/child (when you say things like "you barely know her" and "you can't make a decision based on a relationship that might end as quickly as it began" inevitably kids shut their ears or tell you you don't understand what it's like).

I guess I would say the following to your son:

1. You have two good choices. In my judgment, Princeton offers a better more personalized academic experience with a more diverse student boy--Michigan is 71% white with 68% of the students coming from in-state, while Princeton is 61% white and is much more geographically diverse. Also, because Princeton is much smaller, you will not find it as hard to get courses you want, find a crowd to hang out with and get more attention from professors.

2. Personally, I don't think that deciding on the basis of a GF is a good idea, because relationships can end and then you might feel you made a mistake.

3. While this might seem crass, Princeton probably has more prestige overall and will provide you with unparalled alumni connections.

4. Since Princeton doesn't allow transfers, if you decline acceptance you will not have the option to change your mind and go there. However, in the event that you choose Princeton and are unhappy, you will still have the option to transfer to University of Michigan.

5. The point about burnout is important. However, I doubt that Michigan will be easy. Maybe we should discuss taking a year off if you feel you need it.

I would probably make those points, but ultimately, University of Michigan is a great school and you might not be able to convince your son that your views are correct.

48.<<<Alexandre>>>
I am surprised at some of the posts on this thread. You'd think the boy was chosing some second rate university over Princeton. This is Michigan you are talking about. I seriously doubt the OP's son is leaning toward Michigan because of a girl he met. More likely, he thinks Michigan is a better fit for him. Academically and reputationally, Princeton happens to be one of the 5 universities in the US that is considered slightly stronger than Michigan, but not in some key disciplines, such as Engineering and Business (which Princeton doesn't offer).

I have known several students who have turned down one of those five universities in favor of Michigan, and it was almost always because they thought they would be happier in Ann Arbor. With very few exceptions, they did not regret their decisions. And why shouldn't they? Michigan is generally considered among the top 10 or top 15 universities in the nation, so it's not like they sacrificed a great deal. Michigan has shaped American education as much as any university. Two of MIT's last four presidents (Charles Vest from 1991-2004 and Jerome Wiesner from 1970-1980) were hired from Michigan. Columbia's current president, Lee Bollinger and Princeton's ex president, Harold Shapiro (1988-2001), were also hired from the University of Michigan. Six of Cornell's 13 presidents, including its co-founder (Andrew Dickson White) and two of its last four presidents were hired from Michigan. There is a reason why top universities recruit administrators from Michigan and promote them to their highest posts. The University always stood as an ideal of higher education. Gerhard Casper, a Yale educated scholar and President of Stanford University had this to say about Michigan.

"I am extremely skeptical that the quality of a university - any more than the quality of a magazine - can be measured statistically. However, even if it can, the producers of the U.S. News rankings remain far from discovering the method. Let me offer as prima facie evidence two great public universities: the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and the University of California-Berkeley. These clearly are among the very best universities in America - one could make a strong argument for either in the top half-dozen. Yet, in the last three years, the U.S. News formula has assigned them ranks that lead many readers to infer that they are second rate: Michigan 21-24-24, and Berkeley 23-26-27."

<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/pres-provost/president/speeches/961206gcfallow.html" rel="nofollow">Criticism of College Rankings - September 23, 1996</a>

President Capser's use Cal and Michigan as the crux, or as he put it, "prima facie evidence" , of his argument is indication enough of where those universities stand, at least in the eyes of the academic community.

I think it is important to realize just how good Michigan is. The OP has obviously accepted that Princeton is a great university. Perhaps it is time he gave Michigan a fair chance. That is not to say that he should make sure his son is chosing the right school for the right reasons. I would probably chose Princeton over Michigan myself, even if I think I would have been happier at Michigan. But if his decision to attend Michigan stands, he will still have an unbeatable experience.

49.<<<DunninLA>>>
Regarding alumni connections: I'm not sure Princeton has a large advantage. Per capita, no doubt... but Michigan graduates 4-5 timeas as many both undergrad and grad. The volume of Michigan alumni likely balances the higher prestige of the Princeton alum.

As I mentioned earlier, one really must look at the specific area of study. For Engineering, Michigan is top 5 both undergrad and for Ph.D....

50.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Michigan is as geographically diverse as any school in the nation. There are definitely more people from other parts of the country/world at Michigan then there are with the entire student body at Princeton.

51.<<<evil_asian_dictator>>>
That's because it's a larger school. The reasons the OP is stating for preferring Michigan don't make any sense at all. Basically, he met a girl on campus recently and doesn't want to be away from her? Also, he wants to slack off?

He needs to grow up. I can understand if your son loved Michigan football or something. That's actually a valid reason to some. As the dad, it's important that you advise him to go to Princeton. He needs the school more than you think. At a state school, it's easy to lose motivation in work, play videogames all day and chase a girl around. At Princeton, his passion for learning will reemerge again as he is surrounded by brilliant scholars all around him. He will forget this girl and marry some Princeton girl. Most Princeton grads end up inter-marrying anyway.

You need to talk to your son pronto. Don't let him make a big mistake.

52.<<<GoBlue81>>>
[quote]Also, because Princeton is much smaller, you will not find it as hard to get courses you want, find a crowd to hang out with[/quote]
I've never heard any complaints from Michigan students about not getting into courses they want. On the other hand, a Princeton student may not have any many variety of courses to choose from.

About your second point. How is it easier to find a crowd to hang out with at a smaller school?
[quote]Princeton ... will provide you with unparalled alumni connections.[/quote]
Princeton is less than a fifth of the size of Michigan. Frankly, I've never met more than a handful Princeton grads in my entire career.
[quote]I doubt that Michigan will be easy.[/quote]
It's not easy to get A's at Michigan. However, one can easily cruise along for 4 years as a C+/B- student in Ann Arbor... and there are plenty of activities to keep you occupied, both on and off campus. This is precisely the problem with the OP.

53.<<<UCBChemEGrad>>>
[quote]At a state school, it's easy to lose motivation in work, play videogames all day and chase a girl around.[/quote]
Yeaaah, Michigan's "state school" environment for sure leads someone to that outcome...

54.<<<Alexandre>>>
EAD, Michigan/Ann Arbor inspire learning. It is generally regarded to be one of the most intellectual settings in the country. Besides, slacking off isn't an option at a school of Michigan's calibre. The faculty, wich is ranked among the top 5 in the nation, has pretty high standards.

55.<<<Relampago>>>
Michigan is great but it is not Princeton, plus I am sorry but the kid's logic is skewed. Plus, I agree with the notion that it is not just about the kid, it is about family too.

56.<<<BlueHouse>>>
If it is your goal to send your son to Princeton, why not offer to fly him to Ann Arbor 3-4 times during the year (and keep your promise.) Tell him his GF can come for Christmas (or Winter Break if your family does not celebrate Christmas) Tell him you understand how much he cares about her and that you will do everything (pay for unlimited texts?) to be sure that if they want to be in contact they can be. Really support him by enabling him to see that choosing Princeton is not choosing against his GF.....remember being in love for the first time? That said, he will likely be equally successful at these two wonderful institutions. Ann Arbor is pretty awesome. Princeton is terrific.

57.<<<Alexandre>>>
Relampago, Michigan is not Princeton, but then again, Princeton is not Michigan. All in all, both are exceptional institutions, with Princeton edging Michigan out by the smallest of margins.

And how do you know that the kid's logic is skewed? Did you actually talk to him? We have very little information to go on. I think a person who is good enough to get a full ride at Michigan and get into Princeton is probably going to be pretty rational.

58.<<<Alumother>>>
Princeton is hardly small.

When you have over 1000 kids in your freshman class, you have A LOT of people to get to know.

You will go four years and in no way know everyone on campus, not even in your class. You will not begin to feel it is small.

59.<<<hawkette>>>
Alex,
The margin between Princeton and U Michigan is not close. U Michigan is one of the top five public universities in the country. Princeton is one of the top five colleges on the planet.

The only circumstances where I could see a student picking U Michigan over Princeton would be 1) a sizable cost difference for some reason; 2) some department that U Michigan offered that Princeton did not; 3) some kid who really liked college football; or 4) some kid who was following a bf/gf to college (and I think we'd agree that this is a pretty flimsy reason).

I'd be happy to provide lots of detailed comparisons if you like, but please give the Princeton-U Michigan equivalence commentary a rest. It insults our intelligence.

60.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
What a surprise to see hawkette here. According to him/her no public university is equivalent or better than any decent private school.

61.<<<hawkette>>>
rjkofnovi,

Way to build a strong argument!

Is this level of thinking representative of what one can expect at U Michigan?

Maybe I'm overrrating the place.

62.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Not at all. I find it difficult to argue with anyone who always appears to be pompous. I reread your post. Where is your strong argument other than your opinion? If this is the level of thinking of what one can expect at Princeton, it's no wonder many people might not chose to attend there. By the way, i too feel Princeton is at or near the top of the list of the best colleges in the country. It's your attitude that i read all over these message boards that gets to me. You never seem to give any top public universities the same respect you give to top privates.

63.<<<Alumother>>>
Um, I don't think hawkette is a Princeton alum.

I am however.

And I admit ignorance when I am ignorant. For example:

Um, I don't think hawkette is a Princeton alum.

64.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Aplogies to you Alumother. I know Princeton is a wonderful school. Not my intention to offend an alumnus of such a fine institution.

65.<<<Alumother>>>
Oh gosh am I in the wrong place? I thought I was somewhere where we are all really rude to eachother and flame eachother. Civility? Eeek.......

*shakes head, backing out of the room, wondering when this 50-year old mother started to act like a teenager.....:)*

BTW, no offense taken in the slightest. I am embarassed, perhaps I was being too snide. Goodness you should READ some of the times when people have bitten me to pieces here.

66.<<<hawkette>>>
Rjko,
I think that U Michigan is a fine university, but for undergraduate education, I dont think it is in Princetons class. Im sorry.

You asked why I think this. Please consider the following comparisons between U Michigan and Princeton. The differences are not small.

PEER ASSESSMENT
Princeton	4.9 U Michigan	4.5

67.<<<danas>>>
I am a proud graduate of my flagship state institution, from which I received a fine education.
Princeton is just at another level in almost every way. You can't compare the two. I'm glad my daughter decided to take it to another level.

68.<<<evil_asian_dictator>>>
I went to a University of Michigan feeder high school in-state so I have a pretty good idea of how strong the school is. At my HS, at least 2/3 of the "Ivy caliber" students(3.9+ GPA, 2200+ SAT, 33+ ACT) end up going to UMich because it's such a good deal in-state financially. So to Alexandre's defense, there are a lot of smart kids there.

In fact, I would venture to say the top 200 students at Michigan are probably roughly as accomplished/intelligent as the top 200 students at Princeton. However, past this point, that is when one notices a world of difference between Princeton and Michigan. There are kids who get into Michigan with like a 25 ACT and a 3.6-3.7 GPA(even less if URM). At Princeton, the bottom 200 students are almost the same academically as the rest of the student body.

Let's forget about prestige, job placement, academic quality, faculty strength, wtc. for a moment here and consider the OP's situation. As a dad, are you confident that he will be the top of his class at Michigan considering how vulnerable he has been of late? If the answer is no, then you owe him the opportunity to go to Princeton so he can clear his mind and get a fresh start amidst the leaders of tomorrow and scholars from all over the world.

69.<<<Caleno>>>
I may have missed an item skimming this thread, but I'm wondering whether OP considered the honors college at U Mich and, if so, how that would affect the opinions expressed here.

70.<<<hawkette>>>
EAD,
Just to be clear, my comments were about the undergraduate student body and the quality of that group and that classroom experience. You'll get no argument from me on the very best 200 students at U Michigan in a head-to-head matchup with the very best at Princeton. I would agree with your assessment that they can stack up (and I would extend this thought to a great many colleges across the country as there are some truly outstanding students at many lower-ranked colleges, eg, BYU, Texas A&amp;M, U Florida, and many more).

71.<<<danas>>>
I agree with the instate focus noted in post #68, at least from one anecdote.
My son's friend at Dartmouth came from a working class suburb of Detroit. He got tired of the blank stares he got when he told people he went to Dartmouth. He finally began to explain that Dartmouth was "the Michigan of the East".

I have no idea if a particular person will get a better education at Princeton or Michigan.

However, when I look at the above objective data, one thing strikes me, Michigan has more students that score higher on test scores than Princeton. Michigan also has more students with top grades than Princeton. Does this make a difference?

I don't know. I have to think, with what, 10,000 courses, and with the opportunity to take graduate classes with graduate students at Michigan, anybody can be challenged at the school. With the honors college, the residential college, Michigan's strong engineering school in addition to the graduate courses available, again, I don't see how a student can't be academically challenged at the school.

I was just at Michigan over the weekend, and I think the school is fantastic, and some of the students I talked to or listened to blew me away with their intelligence and communication skills. Some did not, to be fair; although, I didn't meet anybody who wasn't smart.

The students I met at Michigan enjoyed their experience at the school. There is an incredible amount of school spirit.

I really like the social scene at Michigan too.

For many students, Michigan was their first choice when they were deciding which school to attend.

Oh...I really don't like the weather at Michigan.

Others can talk about the virtues of Princeton. I have heard it is a pretty good school. :)

73.<<<Alexandre>>>
Danas, I though Harvard was the Michigan of the East! hehe!

Hawkette, it was not my intent to insult anybody's intelligence. In fact, I have always expressed my admiration for Princeton. I often say that it is the #1 undergraduate institution in the US. I also openly admitted above that I would personally pick Princeton over Michigan...twice. But to say that Princeton is much better than Michigan is an insult to my intelligence. Michigan is not merely a top 5 public university. It is one of the top 10 universities in the US and one of the top 20 universities on Earth.

But since you took the time to go through the USNWR, why not share other USNWR rankings that are applicable to the OP's son. If I remember correctly, his son is interested in Engineering. Like I said above, Princeton is indeed better than Michigan, but not in Engineering or Business. The USNWR undergraduate rankings seem to agree with me on this one. According to the USNWR, Michigan and Princeton are peers in Engineering.

UNDERGRADUATE ENGINEERING:
#7 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor 4.4/5.0
#12 Princeton University 4.1/5.0

AEROSPACE ENGINEERING:
#3 University of Michigan Ann Arbor
#8 Princeton University

BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING:
#9 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
N/A Princeton University (I don't think Princeton has a Biomedical Engineering program)

CHEMICAL ENGINEERING:
#7 Princeton University
#11 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor

CIVIL ENGINEERING:
#7 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
#15 Princeton University

COMPUTER ENGINEERING:
#7 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
#13 Princeton University

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING:
#5 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
#11 Princeton University

ENGINEERING PHYSICS:
#5 Princeton University
#5 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor

ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING:
#3 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
#16 Princeton University

INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING:
#2 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
N/A Princeton University (again, I don't think Princeton offers Industrial Engineering)

MATERIALS SCIENCES:
#3 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
N/A Princeton University

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING:
#4 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
#13 Princeton University

NUCLEAR ENGINEERING (Graduate rankings)*:
#1 University of Michigan-Ann Arbor
N/A Princeton University

* Roughly 60-80 (15-20 per graduating class) Michigan undergrads major in Nuclear Engineering at any point in time, but for some reason, the USNWR does not have an undergraduate ranking for Nuclear Engineering.

74.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Not sure why that is Alexandre. My sister-in-law graduated from Michigan with a degree in Nuclear Engineering. She is one of the smartest people i know.

75.<<<etcheverry>>>
I tell you guys one thing..i've been to many prestigious universities like Emory, Vanderbilt, Duke, Columbia, NYU, Northwestern, UIUC, University of Chicago and there is not that much different btw these universities. Like Alexandre said some people think that UM is somehow behing of Princeton and i personally don't see that.I think here in america people are obssesed with the ivy league universities and think that large schools like UCLA UM, UCSD, UVA, UW are inferior that the top 5 elite universities.Looking only at the "brand name" when choosing a school is not very wise..like we have seen in these thread for eng. UM is superior than Princeton.

76.<<<dad81>>>
UCLA, Ph.D., brillar, Alumother, Relampago, midatlmom, rjkofnovi, evil_asian_dictator, Alumother, hawkette, danas, dstark, Alexandre.. thank you all for your input and advices. My son finally made his decision and choose Princeton.

After having different opinions and advices, my son did the following:

1) Made a matter list with about 30 items including name recognition, program, location, weather, GF, class size, possible school working loading, student fan base for sports, future academic performance, parent feeling (thanks)
2) Then, weight the factors with different numbers (-2 to 7, I dont know why he choose these numbers).
3) Sum all the number together. Princeton 53.5 vs UM 47.5
4) Talk with his friends, teachers, possible GFs.
5) Finally, making decision and landing at P.

Your inputs make me better understanding the two great schools (you can see the numbers are very close). Thanks.

77.<<<Alexandre>>>
"Then, weight the factors with different numbers (-2 to 7, I dont know why he choose these numbers)."

Let us face it dad81, your son is probably smarter than most of us, so he will probably do a lot of things we won't understand! LOL!

He made the right choice if you ask me. Congratulations!

78.<<<ham>>>
Princeton was the right choice. That's awesome!

79.<<<dstark>>>
dad81, good luck to your son.

80.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Glad he chose Princeton too. Everyone should be happy now. Best of luck.
:-)

81.<<<Alumother>>>
dad81, congratulations on a final decision. I am sure either place would have been a good outcome. I hope your son has a fantastic time at Princeton.

82.<<<sdp000>>>
Michigan can be a hard school. Their graduation rate is not as high as Princeton. Michigan has built a great reputation with their graduate schools. Princeton is much better the undergrads. With Princeton, once you are in "you are in". Not so at Michigan.

83.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
I just read your post sdp000 and i'm still trying to figure out exactly what you were saying.

84.<<<DunninLA>>>
rjkofnovi... he means that Princeton will go to great lengths to intervene if a student is foundering. Michigan (a placeholder for any public flagship univeristy) will not.

85.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Gee, so i suppose Michigan does offer a superior educational experience to Princeton. After all, in the real world, no one is holding your hand if you start to "founder." I would say Michigan prepares its graduates to enter into the work place better. At least according to some people.

86.<<<DunninLA>>>
Gee, I see you are filled with compassion. Humans are not machines and when stuff goes wrong. Princeton can afford more than MICH to intervene. I'm not saying it's necessarily right or wrong, but I'll say more often than not a little hand up is better all around.

87.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Tell me about compassion in the work place DunninLA. It's sink or swim. I guarantee you that there are people at Michigan who help out those you are struggling. Of course not to the extent of Princeton. This is not a knock on Princeton. I'd imagine most people who enter there are eminently qualified.
