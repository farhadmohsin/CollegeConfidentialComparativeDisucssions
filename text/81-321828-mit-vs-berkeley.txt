Looking at EECS major.

2.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Well, to start, MIT is much smaller than Berkeley, and therefore there are more faculty members per undergraduate student. It's pretty fair to say that you'll get more face time with professors at MIT than at Berkeley; that's not to say that you won't get any at Berkeley, just that you'd get more at MIT. It's easier to find research jobs, because there aren't as many students vying for them -- virtually all MIT undergrads participate in undergraduate research.

Classes are also generally going to be smaller, and registration for them will not be a problem -- there are very few lotteried classes at MIT, and even lotteried classes are generally easier to get into. You won't have to put off graduating at MIT because of that one really popular class that you can't get on your schedule.

The support system at MIT is pretty strong. I wrote a blog entry about it <a href="http://www.mitadmissions.org/topics/learning/advising_support/the_first_step.shtml" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It's difficult to slip through the cracks at MIT.

I would imagine that course diversity and difficulty would be approximately similar, unless anybody else has any more information.

3.<<<KnightMair>>>
Is this even a contest? MIT all the way. MIT was my dream/reach school, while Berkeley was my safety.

4.<<<Perplexitudinous>>>
Not sure anyone can necessarily consider Berkeley a safety. I know someone who got into Princeton but was rejected (in state!) from Berkeley.

5.<<<collegealum314>>>
I disagree. You can guarantee a spot at Berkeley through grades, test scores, and academic performance whereas that is virtually impossible at Princeton. However, Princeton may take some people who really don't have great grades and test scores but have some other quality. It is more subjective. Although Princeton is much more selective than Berkeley, Princeton may take people who wouldn't qualify for Berkeley admission.

So yeah, you can talk about Berkeley being a safety school.

6.<<<mpoon2489>>>
Luckily, I got in both schools anyway. Realistically, I suppose required major classes don't differ too much in quality, but I was trying to look for other differences, outside of a specific major's academics.

7.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Well, the subject listing for EECS at MIT is <a href="http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6a.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I don't know where Berkeley's is, but you can definitely look through MIT's. :)

8.<<<pplive>>>
MIT. Berkeley may be able to compare with MIT(but I believe it's still weaker) in graduate school. But when considering undergraduate, MIT is the strongest. It's even not a contest, like KnightMair said.

9.<<<hedoya>>>
I have heard that MIT is not about legacy and only about genius. Princeton entrance can be about essays, $$$$, connections, grades and ec's etc. Frist's kid for example could get into Princeton but not into MIT let alone survive it. That speaks volumes.

10.<<<1of42>>>
hedoya: whoever said that was biased. frist is a crappy example, because his father donated a BUILDING - development admits will get in almost anywhere, including MIT. i also think it's pretty crappy of you to belittle him when you don't even know him, much less what he is capable of. Additionally, surviving MIT is not murderous - at MIT, like at most schools, you can get through with easier courses if you're so inclined. It may not be anywhere as easy at MIT, but it's not impossible.

If you're looking for a school whose admissions are almost not at all holistic, but about what might be considered raw intelligence, look at Caltech. I'm not saying that their students are tons smarter than MIT (which is impossible, since MIT students are pretty damn smart), but since Caltech doesn't take into account holistic factors to anywhere near the level that MIT does, and also cares much less about diversity in admits, it comes much closer to your criterion.

MIT is actually much more similar to Princeton in how its admission process works. Yes, math and science are prized, but unusual people with interesting applications don't need unbelievable genius to get in necessarily.

11.<<<collegealum314>>>
"MIT is actually much more similar to Princeton in how its admission process works. Yes, math and science are prized, but unusual people with interesting applications don't need unbelievable genius to get in necessarily."
<hr>
I went to a math and science magnet people with a lot of people who got into both MIT and CalTech. It was always the same group of people. The Princeton/Harvard/Stanford admits were very different from the MIT/Caltech admits although there was a small overlap...

However, that was 10 years ago. The new MIT admissions director has said that 15% of a given entering class never would have gotten in under the old standards. These 15% did not have the best academic record but demonstrated "passion". Personally, many MIT alums (including me) disagree with this less objective evaluation of candidates. There's a lot more anxiety now among people with stellar academic credentials when applying to MIT.

12.<<<Sklog_W>>>
^ I strongly agree with the way MIT does its admissions. Some of the people who contribute most to my college experience are those that never dreamed they could get into this school.

13.<<<collegealum314>>>
On the Stanford forum there's a story about how Andrew Fire, recent Nobel Laureate in medicine, applied to and was rejected from Stanford undergrad to his great disappointment. Instead he went to Berkeley.

My feeling is if you have the potential to win the Nobel Prize and have done your best in high school, then you should be able to study at MIT. And guess what, even top students have other sides of their personality though they may not be the best at selling it.

It's very simple: the people who are the most talented and committed at school should have the most choices in where to study for college.

Maybe the olympics should do the same thing...take some actual fast and strong people and some couch potatoes with "great personalities..."

14.<<<collegealum314>>>
I will add that maybe the people you know who never dreamed of getting in are just modest. Or perhaps they just went to a small high school and didn't think being the best there would be good enough.

15.<<<jamsmad>>>
No, it's not "simple." What distinguishes someone as talented or committed in school? Does entering academic competitions mean that? Do grades? Sports? Clubs? Community Service? Art? Science Fairs? Tests? It's very, very difficult.

If someone didn't have access to all that at his school how can you compare his commitment in school? If someone has the grades and accomplishments but needed to study and work every waking hour in order to get a decent score in high school classes, does he really deserve to go to a rigorous place like MIT where most likely he will only break down as he has even less time?
But he's sooooooo committed to school.

In high school I did my school work as needed but beyond that I just did sports. I wasn't stellar at them, barely noticeable in a small school, but I liked to play sports and was devoted to them. I had the opportunity to enter many academic competitions and science fairs but I just chose not to. Does that mean I'm not trying hard enough and don't deserve to be here? I liked sports, I didn't like school outside of school. Is that a flaw?

Your "simple" choice becomes a game of chance. There's no way if MIT can know if a super-smart kid will succeed or fail at MIT. Frankly I'd rather see them take a chance on some kids than just accept all those that showed talent in a purely school environment. If a kid shows a passion for learning and life in his essay but has worse grades/scores/"school commitment" than some kid who writes an essay showing off his academic accomplishments does he not deserve a spot here? I'd rather be discussing issues, living life, and becoming friends with the first kid. Yeah, maybe that is partly about selling yourself to the school in your essay (and maybe that's slightly flawed) but what else is the essay for? Does anyone really think they're measuring your writing ability for the rigorous HASS classes of MIT?

Oh and if you have some secret to tell which high school seniors will grow up to be Nobel Laureates please feel free to tell MIT admissions. I'm sure they'd be very interested to know how to pick them out.

Yeah and I definitely know people who never dreamed they'd get in (1400 SATs, no state awards, one or two APs) and they're here, doing better than a lot of kids. So no matter how simple you think it should be, it's not and never will be.

16.<<<pebbles>>>
come to MIT, silly.

21.<<<figgiesblazin>>>
If you're in-state for Cal, go to MIT. This is actually one of the reasons why I'm picking MIT over both Stanford and Cal. This is the time to go somewhere new. Especially as a California resident, if you don't go somewhere different now, you never will.
Also, for EECS MIT is superior to MIT. If you were talking math, I would say you could go either way.
MIT definitely has smaller classes (I took Multivariable calc at cal last semester and was in a 500 seat lecture hall. Generally, there were people left sitting on the steps during exams.)
Berkeley has a really interesting city, but so does Boston/Cambridge. Cambridge is like a very toned-down Berkeley.
Also, unless you're a Reagents scholar, you aren't guarranteed housing at Cal except for your first year. At MIT, you can live on campus all four years.
Either way, you'll probably have a great time.

22.<<<sakky>>>
[quote]Also, unless you're a Reagents scholar, you aren't guarranteed housing at Cal except for your first year.[/quote]

That was the former poolicy. Berkeley guarantees housing for 2 years now to all admits. But the 2nd year of housing often times tends to be rather mediocre (i.e. a triple in one of the less desirable dorms).

For your circumstances, I would take MIT in a landslide. It's not even a close call. If you need only 1 reason, it would be the MIT EECS MEng program. It's relatively easy (as far as the standards of MIT go) to get into the MEng program - something like 75% of all EECS undergrads qualify and 65% will enroll. You basically need only a 4.0/5 GPA to be eligible.

Put another way, as long as you are within the top half of your class as an MIT EECS undergrad, you are basically guaranteed admission to engineering grad school. And not just at any scrub grad school - but <i> back into MIT </i>. This is one of the strongest "home field advantages" I know of that is available to engineering students at any school. But the program is available only to MIT undergrads. In contrast, it is significantly more difficult to get into the BS/MS EECS program at Berkeley - without a 3.5/4, you probably won't be eligible.

<url>http://www-mtl.mit.edu/~penfield/pubs/meng-report-p.html</url>
<url>http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/FiveYearMS/</url>

If you need a second reason, then I would point to the ease of switching majors at MIT. If you decide that you'd just rather study some other engineering instead, or just study a science or math, or even decide that you'd rather just get a Sloan management degree, you are completely free to do that. Nobody is going to stop you - you can declare whatever major you want.

Not so as a Berkeley EECS student. It's not that easy to switch from one engineering major to another, as all of them are impacted. I know plenty of Berkeley engineering students who wanted to switch from one engineering major to another and were denied, and so were forced to stay in a major that they didnt' really want. This happens even if you want to get out of engineering completely. I know some engineering students who were doing poorly and so were desperately tryingto get into the College of Letters &amp; Science and were denied because their GPA was too low (L&amp;S strongly prefers that you have at least a 3.0/4 to switch in, and it's very easy as a Berkeley engineering student to wind up with less than a 3.0/4). Hence, the upshot is that you can end up in the so-called "major trap", which is the worst of both worlds - where, because you are doing poorly in engineering, <i> you have to stay in engineering </i>. You would think that those engineering students who are doing poorly ought to be the first ones allowed to leave, but precisely the opposite happens - <i> those who are doing poorly are precisely the ones who are forced to stay </i>.


I would choose Berkeley over MIT for undergrad for 3 reasons. #1, money, but this doesn't seem applicable in your case. #2, you have a strong interest in the humanities, but again, this doesn't seem applicable in your case. And #3, you have strong ties to the Bay Area, but again this doesn't seem applicable in your case.

Grad school is a different story. I know plenty of people who turned down MIT for Berkeley for grad school (and vice versa). Undergrad at Berkeley has certain issues that the graduate programs don't share.

24.<<<eastcoastbound>>>
and may i respectfully add that berkeley is about 40 miles away from the silicon valley, which hosts the most dynamic job market in the nation for eecs. berkeley grads have extensive influence there and berkeley eecs is very highly regarded. (more than mit eecs, dare i say). but it doesnt mean that come to berkeley will give you a better education than mit. just thats just something to think about.

and i don't believe mit grad programs are necessarily better than berkeley's. it is really hard to make a statement like one is better than another because each school has own specialties.

That's a pretty strong statement, don't you think? I am not aware of any convincing data that Berkeley EECS is more highly regarded than MIT EECS, particularly at the undergraduate level.
[quote]and i don't believe mit grad programs are necessarily better than berkeley's. it is really hard to make a statement like one is better than another because each school has own specialties.[/quote]

Well, we're not exactly talking about strength of grad programs per se, are we? I believe we're talking about undergrad here.

I bring up the issue of grad programs solely because of the connection to undergrad - that I suspect it's probably <i> easier </i> to get into a top EECS grad program from MIT than from Berkeley, if for no other reason, like I said before, MIT offers extraordinarily strong home-field advantage for its undergrads to get into its own MEng program. In other words, an MIT EECS undergrad is almost certainly more likely to get into MIT for EECS graduate school (i.e. the MEng program) than a Berkeley EECS undergrad is likely to get into Berkeley for EECS grad school. So even we were to presume that Berkeley graduate EECS really was better than MIT graduate EECS (a questionable assertion, but let's assume it), who cares if you can't even get into Berkeley for grad EECS?

28.<<<sakky>>>
[quote]If you're not that smart, you shouldn't be going to Berkeley....and you definitely shouldn't be going to MIT.[/quote]

Ha! I would argue that MIT is actually <i> more </i> forgiving than Berkeley is. For example, if nothing else, at least at MIT, by academic policy, will hide your failing freshman grades. So if you fail a whole bunch of your classes in freshman year, nobody outside of MIT will know that, which means that you can apply to transfer to some other school with a clean slate. But if you go to Berkeley and fail a bunch of classes in freshman year, your academic record is permanently stained for all to see. You can't easily transfer out to a decent school because they will demand to see your Berkeley transcript and will not be impressed when they see your failing marks.

But the bottom line is this . Berkeley can be a <i> very cold and compassionless </i> school when you're not doing well. I've seen it happen to a lot of people.

29.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Doing well vs. not doing well in college, particularly in something like engineering, is not always a question of being smart or not smart. College is very different from high school, and plenty of kids who did very well in high school do not do well in a college environment.

The problem is that you can't really tell beforehand whether you are going to be a superstar in college or whether you are going to do poorly, which is one reason it's good to come to MIT -- you don't <i>have</i> to be a superstar in college to get a great job or get into grad school.

[quote]Sakky: I am currently an ece major at Cornell. Does it mean that I cannot apply to MIT for grad school (EECS)?[/quote]

It means you cannot apply to the special MEng EECS program as that program is strictly reserved only for MIT EECS undergrads (hence, the 'home-field advantage' that I am talking about). Instead, if you apply to MIT EECS, you have to apply to the PhD program, which is obviously much harder.

[quote]You are correct, we're not talking about grad school.

Oh, I don't know about that. Seems to me that quite a few organizations successfully separate out grad from undergrad. Many top employers, i.e. consulting and banking firms in particular, seem to understand that such a separation exists. That's why you have more MIT undergrad engineers heading off to high-prestige consulting and banking jobs than do Berkeley undergrad engineers.
[quote]My other point was, if you'll have to pay less for a Berkeley engineering degree, which, btw, provides the same opportunities as MIT and Stanford grads do, would it not be wise for you to go there?[/quote]

This is a complete irrelevant point for the purposes of this thread. After all, the OP specifically said "I am offered similar aid packages", which leads me to believe that his costs are the same.
[quote]Someone posted here the salary data of engineering grads and they show that Berkeley engineering grads are among the highest paid grads. Now, taking that into consideration plus Berkeley's global reputation which is considered a top school, etc, etc... why would you go somewhere else?[/quote]

Oh, I don't know - all the reasons I stated? You even said it yourself, MIT is a little more prestigious. Moreover, I am convinced that MIT offers a better undergraduate environment. If nothing else, at least you can switch majors freely while at MIT. You decide that you'd rather major in Sloan management, or some other form of engineering? Fine, go right ahead, nobody is going to stop you. However, at Berkeley, certain majors are impacted, particularly engineering &amp; business, hence you may end up in a major that you don't really want.
[quote]For undergrad, MIT is a little bit prestigous, at least according to you and me.[/quote]

Exactly. So let's turn the question around - why would you want to give up that little edge, if you don't have to, ceteris paribus?
[quote]MIT does not have the monopoly anymore.[/quote]

Uh, who here has ever argued that MIT ever had a "monopoly"? Heck, Berkeley was actually founded <i> before </i> MIT. If you look through the history, you will probably find that Caltech became a truly prominent tech school before MIT did (i.e. Caltech had Nobel Prize winners years before MIT ever did). Hence, nobody ever seriously claims that MIT has a "monopoly" on anything.

38.<<<iAppler>>>
Go to M.I.T. if you don't like the sun. I went to Berkeley last year during summer and it was darn hotttt~~~.

39.<<<Theophilius>>>
Although this thread is old, I am writing to inform future college applicants that a degree from the University of California, Berkeley can give as many opportunities as a degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology can. First of all, it would be necessary to state first that MIT and UC Berkeley are on the same tier when it comes to engineering. Although some may suggest that MIT's prestige in the field of engineering is more dominant, it is certainly arguable as the difference between the 1st ranked program (MIT) and 2nd ranked program (Berkeley; as well as Stanford) is more or less small.

Sakky's claims regarding the undergraduate environment at Berkeley are valid to a certain extent. However, Berkeley's undergraduate program is on par with that of MIT and with that of other top tier universities such as Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. As one of the world's most preeminent research institutions, the Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP) at UC Berkeley helps students to find research opportunities in their desired fields such as Electrical Engineering, Economics, Business, Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology. These research opportunities are available every semester.

As for EECS, the major is simply top class. A Berkeley student with a EECS degree can easily get his or her desired position at his or her desired workplace, assuming that the person has a good GPA (>3.2). Corporations such as Apple, HP, Dell, Boeing, Accenture, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Google regularly hire Berkeley students. Some Berkeley engineers decide to pursue graduate school at places such as Stanford, MIT, and Cornell.

Yes, a few students do occasionally tend to fall behind. These students probably cannot get the same prestigious job positions as most people do at Berkeley. But think of it this way: You are at college and you are in charge of your life. If you make serious mistakes in life, life will not be tolerant. You must face the consequences. College is about preparing for the life ahead. So yes, a small number of students fail the course because they are silly and are not prudent enough to make the right decisions. The University of California, Berkeley will help you when in need but it will not baby-sit you for entirety.

40.<<<sakky>>>
[quote]A Berkeley student with a EECS degree can easily get his or her desired position at his or her desired workplace, assuming that the person has a good GPA (>3.2)[/quote]

That's one heck of an assumption, particularly as the Berkeley EECS grading guidelines specifically instructs EECS faculty to assign typical grades between 2.7-2.9. A student earning a 3.2+ will therefore be performing significantly above average.


<i>A typical GPA for courses in the lower division is 2.7...A typical GPA for courses in the upper division is 2.9.</i>

[quote]Yes, a few students do occasionally tend to fall behind. These students probably cannot get the same prestigious job positions as most people do at Berkeley.[/quote]

Just a few? As stated above, <i>the average</i> student is going to be earning between a 2.7-2.9 engineering GPA. Such a student would then not even be able to <i>apply</i> to many of the better engineering companies or grad schools, which often times implement minimum GPA cutoffs at 3.0. Note, simply being able to apply is hardly any guarantee that you will receive the offer, but <i>they can't even apply</i>. {Heck, even if you could apply, let's face it, a 2.7-2.9 GPA ain't exactly going to impress anybody.}

Then let me put it to you this way. MIT offers an 'adjustment period' during its freshman year during which all failing grades are deliberately excluded from the external transcript. MIT sophomores are also provided with the option to designate a course as 'exploratory' which allows them to view the final course grade they receive <i>and then</i> decide whether to retain the course or convert it to Listener (which is effectively a retroactive drop). The policy was implemented specifically to provide students with the freedom to take courses outside of their comfort zone without overly fearing a poor grade.

<i>These policies are intended to help you adjust to MIT's teaching and grading methods and the workload without having to worry about accumulating a grade point average (GPA). Many students use the freedom of hidden grades in the first year to adjust to the demands of MIT and to take some educational risks</i>

<a href="http://web.mit.edu/firstyear/2013/subjects/grading.html" rel="nofollow">MIT Freshman Class: Right Now-Freshman Grading and Credit Limits</a>

<a href="http://web.mit.edu/registrar/reg/grades/exploratory.html" rel="nofollow">Sophomore Exploratory Option: MIT Office of the Registrar</a>

But Theophilius, according to your philosophy, MIT should dispense with those policies. After all, as you said, you are in college and therefore in charge of your life, and since life doesn't tolerate serious mistakes, you should face the consequences. Therefore, silly and imprudent MIT freshmen and sophomores who fail their courses should be punished for their immaturity, for after all, MIT should not be babysitting anybody, right? But that's not what happens. Is then the implication that MIT doesn't produce prepared graduates?
[quote]First of all, it would be necessary to state first that MIT and UC Berkeley are on the same tier when it comes to engineering.[/quote]

If they are on the same tier, then that begs the question of why MIT freshmen engineers are allowed to shield their failing grades, but Berkeley freshmen engineers are not.

Otherwise, I think we have to admit that we've uncovered a rational reason why somebody might prefer MIT over Berkeley. While I might fail as a freshman at either school, at least MIT allows me to hide those grades.

41.<<<mathboy98>>>
@Theophilius, I think realistically, all the policies MIT offers to help its undergrads make a lot of sense; there's no reason why entering a top school for engineering from possibly some random high school, one should have to have near no safety nets. Aids in risk-taking actually tend to produce better prepared candidates, because they help one get over fears during a transition period.


Nevertheless, I think when comparing two exceptional engineering schools with very different campus cultures and locations, the decision should be hard. So I will suggest a few ways one can look at the problems at Berkeley, which may help provide perspective.


First, we're taking of two very hard schools. Eventually at MIT, you will face the music. In fact, while there can be similarly high caliber researchers at Berkeley, there are instances where MIT courses just move faster, sort of because they assume they can. At the end of the day, a course is just a course, and the speed is probably unnecessary -- you probably won't use that material in exact form in industry later, and for grad school, you'll likely have to learn completely new stuff which may or may not be related.

Regarding frosh/soph risk-taking: my impression is the COE is the main one with the horrible policy of not allowing pass/fail grading options for technical courses. You have an easy safety net for your GPA, else. If you're in the COE, the best option to sample courses is probably to audit them early on and then take them when you feel like it, if you really feel like it. After all, no matter what, eventually if it's a course you want on your transcript, you have to buckle up and do your work, whatever school it is. The drop deadline is generally 5 weeks in, and most of the frosh professors have a midterm by then to give you a solid idea of how you're doing. If you do your homework and verify that such an indicator is a good one, then you can avoid failing. It's a more delicate exercise, but when you're comparing two hard schools, it's probably fair to say they both require caution.



All in all, I don't think safety nets are actually a reason I would use to pick a school between these two, for aforementioned reasons. Plus, I think it is possibly more likely to be a misfit for MIT's student culture.


A good reason to pick MIT would be the flexibility of changing majors. At Berkeley, if you decide you're going to do engineering, and you weren't admitted to the college, it can be rough to get in once a Berkeley student. If admitted to engineering, you should mostly forget this factor too, because it's quite easy to switch out with a decent GPA. If you don't have the capability of getting a decent GPA due to medical issues, you can take time off. If you selected courses that give you an idea how you're doing early, are a frosh/soph meaning you have the chance to balance technical with non-technical classes to help your GPA anyway (for breadth coursework that's required), and still managed to fail your classes, then you haven't done your homework -- I have sympathy for that, but I don't think it's possible if you plan ahead of time.


I know this is an old thread, but it's probably good to repeat some things.

One teeny reason to continue is the voice of real experience:
This is such a crock and evidence of overblown arrogance by MIT students. I checked out this MIT site as my daughter has fallen in love with this school. My daughter is hoping to be accepted; she wishes to go for the tauted flexibility, because it is #1 in engineering...and because it is the best of the best, yes sir. My wife and I are not supportive because: we live3000 miles away, and it costs ~$25k more in total compared to UCB, and frankly she and all of the rest of your are smoking some not so good stuff if you think the intsy weentsy differences in rating on these degrees between these schools is going to allow you to earn a significant financial difference over the course of your life-thereby given you an easy way to pay off your large MIT incurred cost-whether loans or whatever. I work for a large software/engineering company , and I can tell you, it won't. 10 years we had a choice between an MIT EECS undergrad and a San Jose State EECS--the SJST got the job(and boy has he been great!) Similar gpa's, slightly better test scores by the SJSU guy, and similar letters of recommdation, and better interview. We-and most of our cohorts took him on his gpa, test scores, and the interview! When it comes to getting a job this is the BIG deal; going to the big school is not. Last year he went to UCB for Masters--I'm sure the MIT guy went somewhere also good...but doubt better, and doubt he will make i more money nor have more job satisfaction. Mabye the SJSU guy could have a chip on his shoulder if he didn't get into MIT orUCB...but BFD. He'll laugh all the way to the plane for his next vacation instead of staying at home paying back his loan. As for my daughter, yes she has that crazy MIT fever. I've told her I will pay the equivalent of a UCB education, and she will need to find loans for the other $25k/year--since I doubt we will be lucky enough to get minimal if any aid as my wife and I have good jobs...but are not rich. Reality--most of what all of you have written are the sweet excuses of rich boys...or truly more exploitive poor boys who are expecting to not have to show a bit of responsibility for your own education by not paying a dime.
PS-for those applying to medschool, my wife is on the admissions committee, and there it was the grades>score>school>interview in level of importance. Doing great at MIT/UCB but getting C's will hold you back--but sadly, usually the extreme opposite isn't helpful. Go to a school with little name (UCmerced) or one considered to have low academic excellence like some of the Cal State Univ or Colleges, and your application will often get tossed.
Good luck;everyone will take something different from this-hopefully something of value and guidance.
Feel free to comment, but sadly in a job where I work 60 hours + per week, and have alot of responsibility (and not swimming in the dough, but doing ok!) I may not get a chance to answer back. By the way, I did my engineering at UCLA--chose it over UCB and MIT for the weather and occasional chance to suf! Never regretted it...and it never held me back.
All of you are better off saving that $100K differential and inveseting it over time; compare this to the cost of paying that money with interest over time. Yikes!

Regarding the latest post, this thread was regarding comparing MIT vs. Berkeley assuming the costs were the same, as the OP stated. Seems to me that that renders the concerns of the entire last post moot.

However, if you want to inject cost into the equation, I can certainly agree that that may be an excellent reason to choose the cheaper school. I don't think anybody is arguing otherwise, and to those who say that we are, I think <i>they</i> are "smoking the not-so-good-stuff". And besides, for the 90% of Americans who don't live in California, the cost difference between Berkeley and MIT is basically nil, and in fact, Berkeley may actually be <i>more</i> expensive once financial aid is factored in, as Berkeley isn't noted for particularly generous packages. Heck, I can think of some MIT people <i>from California</i> who ended up paying roughly the same as they would have had they attended Berkeley, once their MIT package was factored in. Also see below.

Yet there lies a logical paradox. You say that Berkeley is cheaper than MIT which is obviously true for a California resident who doesn't qualify for significant aid from MIT. But, heck, why stop there? After all, you said it yourself regarding your story of the SJSU guy beating the MIT guy for a particular job. That story doesn't exactly seem to endorse attending Berkeley - if anything, that story seems to endorse attending SJSU or some other lower-tier school and pocketing the corresponding full merit ride. Anybody who is good enough to get into MIT is surely good enough to land a merit-based full-ride at most lower-tier schools across the country. So instead of having to pay for college, you would <i>be getting paid</i>. Why not take that and <i>make</i> money, if money is the prime concern?

But then you say that attending a lower-ranked school might mean his 'application (for a job) might get tossed', although the SJSU guy from the above example seems to belie that assertion. Nevertheless, now I think we're getting to brass tacks. It is certainly true that having a degree from a lower-ranked school might result in having one's application tossed, or, more accurately, not even being given the chance to apply for a particular job in the first place. For example, if you want to work at a top strategy consulting or investment banking firm, you can't do it right out of SJSU, because they don't recruit there.

Whether Ibanking or consulting really ought to be such desirable career paths is a discussion best left for other threads - and indeed, I have written about these topics at length on other threads. Nevertheless, the undeniable fact is, for whatever reason, many top college students want them. When the economy was healthier, nearly half of all MIT students who entered the workforce chose jobs in consulting or banking, and even now during the teeth of the economic downturn, around 30% still do. Only around 5-10% of their Berkeley counterparts do so, even though many more would surely like to, as the recruiting booths for consulting and banking firms during the Berkeley career functions are always packed.

Nevertheless, I certainly agree that if you don't really care about having those sorts of career opportunities and you're satisfied with a regular job, then don't pay extra to go to MIT. And don't pay extra to go to Berkeley either. Go to a lower-tier school that will not only provide you with a full merit ride, but also allow you to cruise through with top grades with relatively little effort due to the lower level of competition.

Interestingly, the year I analyzed data for the admissions office, only two students who were admitted to MIT chose Berkeley over MIT. Many more students chose UMich or Georgia Tech over MIT than chose Berkeley, although there must have been many Berkeley cross-admits simply because so many MIT students are from California.

Maybe CA kids just have an extra helping of ego ;)

A common reason not to go to Berkeley as a Californian, which I've heard is "everyone in CA gets in, did I work to be ranked in the top 5 in my school just to go there?"... and it's not uncommon for some of them with foreign background to resent the fact that their foreign folks have their own elitism which glorifies Berkeley above most to all Ivy Leagues.

@sakky your SN is almost homophonic with 'snarky': a pretty apt description of your posting/writing style, though i'm partial to 'pretentious,' personally. 'Pompous' isn't bad either.

btw, yes, i joined this forum for the sole purpose of reviving -- yet again -- a plucking old asp thread... dunno what the rules are concerning profanity)
all i REALLY want to say is this:

it does not matter which of these schools you choose if choosing based on academic and/or professional criteria. at. all. what matters is (besides intended major obvi) your personal/subjective learning environment preferences (i.e. what class size you prefer, location, housing, student body demographic, so on, so forth, etcetera)

ultimately you're gonna hafta go with the gut: make a holistic judgement call. both schools will provide you with the resources you need to succeed if you are intelligent, diligent, what have you. some rhyming and stuff going on here. cool.

this will be ironic to say (since i'm chiming in a year after thread's death), but this is such a superficial, dumb discussion. whatever. check em both out, and pick one. people can be such ninnies.

Are you instate? MIT gave me way more money than Berkeley :(.

52.<<<soystudious>>>
Also late in joining but I'd like to say a couple points:
1) Berkeley is cheaper if in-state. The chance of an MIT financial aid matching Berkeley in-state?
2) Berkeley DOES NOT ask where your parents went for college at all. Is there any place on the UC application AT ALL where one can list where one's parents went? The admit rate for legacy applicants at Harvard jumps from under 10% to 40%. That, my friends, is NOT an indication of an equitable country or chance for everyone. Second gen/first gen immigrants? Good luck. Asian? Oh dear.
3) Berkeley's location. Though in the summertime students go wherever (IBM New York, etc.) for opportunities, Berkeley's location next to San Francisco (it's literally over the bridge, and we can see the Golden Gate from my laundry room) i.e. Twitter, as well as in the area just makes it such a great place to study EECS. Google case competition? Facebook Hackathon [url]<url>https://www.****/events/389128324518744/[/url]</url> of Cal v. Stanford? There's a reason why Steve Jobs and the Woz met at Berkeley.
Frankly, the SF Bay Area is just a better location to be a student.

Yes, it's a lot easier to get in to Berkeley as a transfer student from a community college, but I for one actually appreciate that Berkeley as a public university gets to do this. It's a lot more realistic as to the people you'll encounter in life, and most Berkeley students don't develop a Berkeley bubble if you will. Yes, Berkeley is "lower" in U.S. News&amp;World Report rankings, but that doesn't stop it from making top 5 in 90% of its departments. Whether you study English (#1), Sociology (#1), any form of engineering (Top 5),
