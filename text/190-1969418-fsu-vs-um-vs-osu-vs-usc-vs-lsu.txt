Hi! I am currently deciding between the University of Michigan, University of South Carolina, Louisiana State University, Florida State University, and Ohio State University. I am planning on majoring in something business related. I’ll first give a rundown about me and what I look for in a school. I am mainly just interested in getting opinions from others about these schools and what you all think about them.
I am a senior from Michigan and I have applied to 14 schools and narrowed it down to these 5 based on cost and overall feel. I love the idea of a larger school with pride, fun athletics, and overall good academics. I do like the idea of being near a city or fun college town. I have spent the last two years of high school looking at almost every school in the country (not a joke) and now it seems crazy that I am to the stage of selecting a school.
Now I’ll break down how I am feeling about each school.
University of Michigan
COST: $27,000
I have grown up as a Michigan Wolverine, living about 20 minutes away from campus. Both of my parents attended UM Ann Arbor, one sister is getting her undergraduate degree there now, and my oldest sister will be attending for grad school next year. I love the city of Ann Arbor and like how the city in intertwined with the campus. All of that being said, I really want to do my own thing and would love to go out of state. I recognize that UM is the highest ranked institution on my final list, but I really do want to go more than 20 minutes away from home. As of now, I am in LSA and am waiting for Ross decisions.
University of South Carolina
COST: $20,000-22,000
Over the last year and a half, South Carolina has been right at the top of my list. Their international business program is specifically what peaked my interest. IB is something I am very interested in studying. I visited the campus last year and absolutely loved it. I also really liked the city of Columbia. Another huge appeal was the scholarships for out of state students. As of now, I have been guaranteed instate tuition with potential for a little more money. I love the possibility of doing my own thing and getting away from home. Overall their business program is solid. Right now I am waiting to hear from the honors college and capstone scholars program.
Ohio State University:
COST: $28,000-30,000
Ohio State, much to my family’s opposition (not really haha) has been on my list for a while. I toured OSU and liked the campus overall. I got into their business school and scholars program. OSU is definitely a highly ranked school, it has a ton of school spirit, and is right near Columbus which is super cool. Being out of state and different is a huge plus. The scholarships I have received have made it financially possible.
Louisiana State University:
COST: $14,000
Honestly, I applied to LSU on a whim. I did not know too much about the school when I applied. After being accepted and given a scholarship, I have done more research into the school. Financially, this would likely be my cheapest option. I am not exactly sure how their business programs rank, but I know the school is generally respectable. I love the school spirit and the fact that it is located near a city. I have not visited campus, but it looks amazing and I could see myself there. I am also in the honors college.
Florida State University:
COST: $18,000
Florida State has been on my list for a while because of the cost and programs. I saw that the school was ranked fairly well and that the price was amazing, especially with an out of state tuition waver. I looked into their business programs and liked what I saw. I love the school spirit and love that it is in the capital city, although I do not know much about Tallahassee. I have never visited FSU, but from the photos I have seen I really like the campus a lot.
If anyone actually read through all of this, or even if you didn’t, I would really appreciate any feedback or opinions about these schools. Thanks!

2.<<<1917souci>>>
I can relate the fact that you are interested in going OOS. My D18 feels the same away considering the fact that she was accepted to our own excellent instate option but wants to go to go a different part of the country. From your list she was accepted to both OSU and FSU as well as others… Based on your past postings, you really seem to like USC. I honestly think that you have a lot guilt by giving up Michigan. It probably would have been best to have been rejected making your decision a lot easier. Lots of people of these boards would love to be in your shoes. However, it does not necessarily mean that for your that would be your best decision.
USC IB program is among the best and so is their honors program. Having said that, this would the reason to attend USC. However, if for some reason or another, you choose to change majors, this could end a reason for regret.
Not sure why FSU and LSU are on this list we the other choices you have. If UF was an option, then you have a very compelling case especially for Business. Neither FSU or LSU have Direct admissions to the program
This brings me to OSU. which is probably the most balanced of  your choices (.with the exception of course to Michigan).  Top notch academics and a highly ranked direct admit Business School… Incredible sports, and school spirit/pride. Urban setting with lots to do including opportunities for internships and fun activities. For all these reasons, OSU has become my D18 top choice.
I would assume many would think that passing on Michigan is a mistake. However, you have to do what is right for you. USC  is a great choice if your intention is to pursue an IB degree. Otherwise, OSU is the most well rounded from your list.  Once you get past your guilt, you will be able to make the right decision… Keep in mind that by the end of the day is what you make out of it.

3.<<<TheGr8Gatsby>>>
I agree with @1917souci. If you are almost certain about doing IB then it looks like your choices are between USC and UM, and if you aren’t then tOSU and UM. Obviously I would hold off making a decision until you hear about Ross. Please keep us posted 

4.<<<MYOS1634>>>
FSU would be the closest to what you want, especially if you want to be far away. I assume you got into the Honors college, too?
Otherwise, tOsu would be out of state but not so far that you can’t come home for breaks, while USC would have the best honors college and best weather of the bunch (also the best international business program but that’s an added selection, which is competitive).

5.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
" I recognize that UM is the highest ranked institution on my final list, but I really do want to go more than 20 minutes away from home. As of now, I am in LSA and am waiting for Ross decisions."
If (and it’s a big if) you get into Ross, then Michigan is easily your smartest decision for a business degree.    Many instate students who attend Michigan live within 30-60 minutes of campus, since the Detroit area holds almost half the population of the state.   Living on campus is not the same as visiting.  That Ross degree will travel better than any of the other schools you have listed.
“I would assume many would think that passing on Michigan is a mistake. However, you have to do what is right for you. USC is a great choice if your intention is to pursue an IB degree. Otherwise, OSU is the most well rounded from your list.”
OSU is more well rounded than Michigan? Seriously?  OSU is a nice school, but few students would choose it over Michigan unless it was considerably less expensive to attend.
It’s not like the old days in Ann Arbor anymore when it comes to business education.  Michigan Ross will now fill the vast majority of its class as pre-admits.   Wait until the Ross decisions come out before you stress yourself too much.   If you are not admitted, then your other choices become much easier to make.
By the way, I am glad that the Michigan business school is going to this approach.  It’s much more fair for students such as yourself not to commit to a college without the assurance that you’ll be able to study your area of interest.  Also keep that in mind for USC.  From my understanding, getting admitted to the school is relatively easy, but getting admitted to the IB program is not.  Do you really want an undergraduate degree from South Carolina if you aren’t getting that IB degree?

6.<<<1917souci>>>
@rjkofnovi   Obviously you did not read my post
“This brings me to OSU. which is probably the most balanced of your choices (.with the exception of course to Michigan).”

7.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
I read this part from the last paragraph:
“Otherwise, OSU is the most well rounded from your list.”
(perhaps you edited your original posting?)
I just don’t understand where you get the idea that tOSU has the “top notch academics and a highly ranked business school” that is comparable to Michigan’s.  Business education is definitely prestige driven and where you attend school definitely matters when it comes time for that all important first job out of college.  With that in mind, the choice between Michigan Ross and OSU Fisher etal is pretty easy if one gets accepted into both schools.
Btw as an interesting side note;  Max Fisher was Stephen Ross’ uncle.  It’s pretty cool that both have business schools named after them.

8.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
Update: I was admitted to Ross today.

9.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Congratulations!!! Impressive 
So… How are you revisiting your choices?

10.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@MYOS1634 Haha I have no idea what to do now!

11.<<<BuckeyeMWDSG>>>
My D is close by, but we rarely see her. OTOH, when she gets a cold and wants homemade soup delivered, it’s finals and she needs laundry picked up and done, the group poster can’t be printed because the campus print shop is booked because everyone waited till the last minute - she’s got mom. Study abroad can give you plenty of far from home adventure. Whatever you decide, planning a study abroad is well worth it.

12.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
“@MYOS1634 Haha I have no idea what to do now”
That’s too bad. Ross admittance should have made your decision a no brainer.

13.<<<trackmbe3>>>
@pbmcdoug IMO Getting into Ross is like getting into Harvard in terms of prestige and opportunity, particularly for IB and consulting.  You are very fortunate to have an instate flagship such as Michigan, one of the premier schools in the world. At such a great low in-state cost. I understand you wanting to do your own thing, get your own identity, by going out-of-state. The grass is always greener elsewhere —lots of kids don’t want to go to their state flagship —but in your case the grass is really greenest right in your own A2 backyard. Don’t let this awesome opportunity past. The school is large enough and the opportunities offered will allow you to create your own identity. Sometimes in life you have to seize the opportunity given. You don’t want to look back with regret at turning down the best choice academically and career-wise given your business interest. You can always go out-of-state for a summer internship and for grad school. Or get a job out-of-state. Ross will help you do that as Ross students and graduates have great opportunites outside the state (just work hard and excel at Ross). Best of luck!

14.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@rjkofnovi @trackmbe3 Luckily I will be able to visit each school again before I have to make any decisions.

15.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Imagine if you go to USC and don’t get into their IB program?  Do you really want a degree from USC in some other area as compared to one from Michigan?   This is a life long decision.  The choice is obvious to those of us who are a bit older and more knowledgeable in these matters.

16.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
Haha ok, I may be a little more knowledgeable than you give me credit for. I live 20 minutes from Michigan and understand that Michigan and Ross are much more well-rounded than USC, but you have to understand that I have been extremely invested in USC for the last two years. South Carolina would be thousands of dollars cheaper, and I am not making any decisions until I know about the honors college (which if I am accepted I will definitely be in the IB program). My parents are both Michigan alumni, and they understand why I am having a predicament between the two schools. While some of the college selection process deals with rankings, a lot of it comes down to where I would end up feeling most comfortable. @rjkofnovi

17.<<<1917souci>>>
@pbmcdoug   Stop fighting it  The choice is obvious.  University of South Carolina all the way.  That is where your heart is and that is where you should go… From all us outside your head, the choice is pretty obvious. But you and only you can answer this question. I totally get the fact that you do not want to stay close to home. My daughter wants to go out of state even though she was accepted to our excellent in state flagship,  She is leaning to attend The Ohio State University.  Once she was able to secure an incredible scholarship, the choice became much obvious.  IB and Honors at USC is tops… Go where you want to be.

18.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"My daughter wants to go out of state even though she was accepted to our excellent in state flagship.
Which “excellent” school was that?

19.<<<1917souci>>>
The University of Georgia!

20.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
With all due respect, Georgia is not Michigan.  That’s why the OP is having such a difficult time.  He knows that these schools are not equal academically.

21.<<<1917souci>>>
@rjkofnovi  “With all due respect”    You are nothing but disrespectful.  I never compared UGA to Michigan the same way I never said that OSU was the more well rounded school vs Michigan (You did not read the whole post) … But while we are at it, UGA happens to be an excellent school and one that many would be very proud to attend. As public Universities,  both UGA and OSU  are highly ranked and many of their programs are tops. including some within the Business Schools.
Having said all of that, you are right Georgia is not Michigan. But to imply that Georgia it is not an excellent school.  They are much closer than you think.  Many people end up turning down Michigan for the simple fact that it is not worth $60K a year for an undergrad degree (OOS)    The fact that you have been around these boards for a long time, does not mean that you need to be condescending.

22.<<<Publisher>>>
Direct admit to Ross at Michigan is a significant achievement. However, it is easy to understand your desire to study elsewhere in a warmer climate.
I think that you really need to trust yourself & your family in making this decision. Much depends upon where you’re at mentally at this stage of life. Are you really into academics or do you want to let loose & party ?

23.<<<Mac001>>>
pbmcdoug - Congrats on your direct admission to Ross. I see you are very interested in Honors and IB at USC. My son chose USC last year over some higher ranked schools (Indiana -Honors and Kelly direct, OSU - Honors and Fisher direct, Case Western, Miami - Ohio Honors and Farmer, and several others). We are from New England and he applied to mid-west and southern schools because he wanted a different experience. He ultimately chose USC based on a combination of feel/fit, merit scholarship (goal - no undergraduate debt for him or us-we are in the middle- too much for FA too little to pay $45 - $70K per year without debt), SEC sports, school spirit and community.  He was not selected for the HC at USC ( I think his essays were not his best effort) but he did get Capstone and applied and was accepted to IB in the cohort program. You can apply for the cohort program now, even without knowing if you get into the HC and I see that they are having a webinar to describe it on Feb 6th.  the link is https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/moore/academic_programs/undergraduate_programs/undergraduate_majors/international_business/international_business_curriculum/cohort_programs/index.php
Please note that he became interested in the IB program only after orientation and scoring well on the USC language placement test.  He applied after the preferred deadline but was considered and accepted none the less. You are way ahead on this. He is very happy at USC. Good luck with your choices.  There is no single correct decision. You have a host of good options that you have earned and you have the opportunity to choose among your very good options. Best of luck.

24.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
" My son chose USC last year over some higher ranked schools (Indiana -Honors and Kelly direct, OSU - Honors and Fisher direct, Case Western, Miami - Ohio Honors and Farmer, and several others)."
…but not over Ross, which is my point.

25.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
“Having said all of that, you are right Georgia is not Michigan. But to imply that Georgia it is not an excellent school. They are much closer than you think. Many people end up turning down Michigan for the simple fact that it is not worth $60K a year for an undergrad degree (OOS) The fact that you have been around these boards for a long time, does not mean that you need to be condescending.”
I apologize for appearing to be “condescending” but someone has to interject some semblance of reality here.   The OP is  NOT out of state for Michigan, so your comment about not being worth 60K a year is not pertinent.    Furthermore, not all good schools are “excellent.”   In the world of business, to obtain that all important first job in a prestige driven industry,  where you go to school makes a definite difference.  The Michigan Ross name will give the OP a leg up over the other schools mentioned.

26.<<<1917souci>>>
@rjkofnovi   Nobody here is arguing that Michigan is not perceived as the better school. All the posters get that including the original poster. We are all alluding to the fact that many have the desire to go out state and by doing so, they are bypassing whatever “excellent” choices they have. For my us  it is UGA and for this poster, it is Michigan.  This is not a matter of UGA being better than Michigan. Keep in mind,the better school does not always translate into the better fit.
Based on all the choices the OP currently has,   The University of Michigan is the obvious choice. However, the University of South Carolina IB program is tops. If he is able to get into this selective program and he works hard, he will be successful.
No shame here:
“Companies that have hired recent Moore School international business graduates include
Accenture, Amazon, Bank of America, Barclays Investment Bank, BMW, Boeing, Booz Allen
Hamilton, Coca-Cola, Deloitte Consulting, Deutsche Bank, Ernst & Young, IBM, Integration
Point, Johnson & Johnson, JP Morgan Chase, Manhattan Associates, McKinsey & Co.,
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Nestle, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Wells Fargo.
According to a recent USC Career Center survey, the average starting
salary for Moore School international business graduates is $64,114.”

27.<<<MYOS1634>>>
In any case OP should apply for a cohort program that matches his/her interests at USC Moore, just in case :).

28.<<<UMichMD>>>
As someone who grew up in metro-Detroit and went to UM I want to reinforce that attending UM as a student is completely different from growing up 20 minutes away. Ann Arbor truly is 26 square miles surrounded by reality. There is no other place in Michigan like it, and I mean that in the best possible way. It’s far enough away that your parents aren’t going to just “drop by”. It’s big enough that you are not going to have to worry about running into classmates from high school all the time. I honestly think you can have the same social experience at UM than you can have at USC but with the convenience of being close to home IF you need to be.
I was in a similar situation as the OP and had similar dreams growing up and ultimately could not turn down UM when looking at the situation objectively. It would be nice if we could all “follow our heart” and do whatever the heck we wanted to all the time. But that is not how life works. This is your first real “business decision” and when you look at the Xs and Os I think your decision is an easy one.
What do you honestly know about international business? What if you decide you want to be in investment banking? What if you don’t want to do business at all? You are going to be in much better shape at Michigan because it is a top school across the board and it comes at an incredibly low sticker price for you. If you do ultimately decide to go for USC I would strongly recommend you to bargain for more money. Also keep in mind that even though USC looks a bit cheaper on paper, when you add in moving expenses, flights home for the holidays etc. it will probably be a wash.
Best of luck!

29.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
“Based on all the choices the OP currently has, The University of Michigan is the obvious choice.”
Agreed

30.<<<SouthFloridaMom9>>>
If I had a kiddo in your shoes - Michigan would get my vote.

31.<<<3monkeys>>>
@pbmcdoug I hear ya, my D is also struggling with staying so very close to home and attending Michigan, or going away. She has cut some options as they are just too expensive  (Univ of Miami, Wisconsin). But she is still debating Tulane (her favorite) and a couple others. None are cheaper than Michigan (like your choices), so kudos to you!
It seems like either school is a good choice for you, and they are affordable. You have worked hard, done your research, and now have a nice problem - picking from two places you could see yourself.
I do know many students at Michigan who grew up close by. They realize AFTER they get on campus as freshmen that it is far different than walking around AA as a high school kid. Tell your parents you can’t see them until Thanksgiving. You can’t go home on weekends. Just don’t. Don’t room with people from your high school. Get the full experience as if it were a far away campus. Michigan is an amazing place - if you take advantage of the great opportunities.
But only you (and your parents) can make this decision. If my kid had done the research and gotten the merit aid to bring it down in price, I would let her consider SC. If she visited, attended a couple of classes and spent at least one night in a visit program…and still loved it…I would most likely let her go. One size does not fit all, and Michigan alone does not guarantee success. You are in the driver’s seat for that.
Good luck to you!

32.<<<wayneandgarth>>>
While I can see your desire to go out of state, you should look at this beyond the next four years.  What will most likely get you to your goal without a ton of debt?  You likely know that answer.  Also, any high school student is still at a rather young age and should seriously take the advise of parents.

33.<<<Frank_the_Tank>>>
Totally agree with wayneandgarth.
Certain areas of business (e.g. investment banking and management consulting) are extremely prestige-oriented and Ross is on a very short list of places outside of the Ivy/Ivy-equivalents that are targets for such areas. The other schools that you’ve listed simply aren’t on that list (even if you managed to get into honors-type programs there). As a result, from a professional and academic perspective, Ross is clearly the best of your choices by the far and over 55% of the undergrads in that school there are paying out-of-state tuition for the privilege and advantages of being there. The fact that you would be able to get all of that at an in-state tuition price is arguably one of the best returns on investment that you could receive on a college degree from ANYWHERE in the country.
While I sympathize with the desire to get out-of-state, I think one of the biggest mistakes that I see with high school students is getting worried about how “too many of my classmates” are going to a certain school (such as their home state flagship) and then bypassing what might be a better academic choice (and very often a better financial choice). Take it from someone that went to my in-state Big Ten flagship and had over 80 people from my high school class come with me at the same time: I never saw ANY of those people unless I actually proactively wanted to do so since the student population alone is the size of a good-sized city. Michigan has an even larger out-of-state student population and Ross specifically actually has a majority of its students from out-of-state (as noted above), so it’s one of the most nationalized student bodies that you’ll see at any public university. Once you get on campus, it IS going to be very much a bubble that will make that 20 mile distance from home feel like it’s 2000 miles (especially in a place with as many amenities as Ann Arbor). On the flip side, the other public flagships that you’re looking generally have 80%-90% in-state students with all having higher in-state enrollment percentages than Michigan, so you’d be on the opposite side where it may feel like everyone is from the same handful of towns that you have no association with.
Finally, it would be different if you were comparing Michigan to a school like, say, Duke or Emory that is substantially different in terms of size or character. In those instances, I could see where school fit becomes more important. However, you’re looking at other out-of-state flagships that aren’t going to feel much different than Michigan in terms of size and culture (outside of Ann Arbor having a much more intellectual atmosphere compared to those other choices).
As a result, this seems to be more of an emotional choice of wanting to get away for the sake of getting away. I also see that your family all appear to be Wolverines, so this might be a case of wanting to forge a separate identity and using a different college choice to do so. Those are all valid emotions and feelings.
However, as hard as it might be, just picture where you actually want to be in 4 years. Going to Ross is one of the few places outside of the Ivy League and Ivy-equivalents that will allow you to work in every place in the country and you don’t have to worry about being in the top 1% of your class to get there. Wall Street hoovers up Ross grads and, to the extent that they don’t go to Wall Street, they get hired en masse in places like Chicago, Silicon Valley and pretty much every Fortune 500 company anywhere. The other schools on your list are significantly more regionalized… and that matters a ton in the business arena. If you were looking to be an engineer or wanted to head into a profession that required more schooling (such as medicine or law), then sure, taking lower tuition at a lower-ranked school could make a lot of sense. That’s not the case with the business field, though. Prestige rules in the particular area that you’re looking at and there really is a huge difference between the opportunities that would be open to you at Ross compared to everywhere else.
That’s all just my opinion based on what you’ve written here. No matter what, good luck to you on your decision.

34.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
I have been accepted into both Ross and the USC honors college. It is down to these two.

35.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Are you any further in your reflexions?

36.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@MYOS1634 Not yet! I had campus day at Umich and Ross on Friday, and will visit USC in early April. Probably won’t be able to decide until then!

37.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Yes, that’s wise - do an overnight, attend a few classes, line up and sit in the cafeteria to eat the food but also talk with students, read the campus paper, go to the gym and the library, hang out in the dorm lounge.
Take copious notes of your impressions, including gut feelings and straight up narratives (to read and review later).
Did you feel comfortable? When you were uncomfortable was it in a way that excluded you or a way that made you feel you had to step out of your comfort zone? Did you feel intellectually challenged? Did the classes stretch you and were the students enthusiastic/passive/ something in between?  Did you like your environment and surroundings?

38.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
I have decided that I will attend the University of South Carolina! Go Gamecocks!

39.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Congratulations! Can you explain, for future readers, how you made that decision, what made you hesitate, any family factors, what sealed it?

40.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
Yes! I thought about it a lot over the last month, visited Umich since it is so close and talked to a lot of people. The only thing drawing me to Michigan was the ranking and name. I live 20 minutes away, grew up a Michigan fan, both parents went there, and I have two sisters there now. I really really wanted to do my own thing and try something new. All of that being said, I really wanted to go out of state. I found South Carolina, loved the campus and overall vibe I got from visiting. They offered generous scholarships which made going out of state affordable, and actually a bit cheaper than Michigan. On top of all of that, they have a terrific business school (and international business program) and honors college which intrigued me. When I thought a lot about it, I realized that I could see myself being much happier at SC. It offered a good price, great school spirit, and great academics in what interested me (maybe not as high as Michigan, but I just liked it better). My family definitely pushed Michigan, but everyone else I talked to said they had never seen anyone love as school as much as I seemed to like SC! @MYOS1634
I also thought about where I would possibly get a job after college. I know Michigan would open more opportunities all over the country, but I wouldn’t mind living in the southeast in places like Charlotte or Atlanta.

41.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Thank you! That’s very helpful. Sounds like you really thought it through and made the best decision for you. Many adults here advise against being blinded by rankings. In your case, you chose the best fit for you. Now, make the most of your opportunities (perhaps apply for one of the cohort programs?), start getting in touch with people about majors and classes, etc.  Congratulations!
