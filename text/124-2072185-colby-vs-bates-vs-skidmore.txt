I’m down to choosing among Colby, Bates & Skidmore for college. I have to ED one of them. I’ll be majoring in Economics and probably double major in Statistics/Computer Science/Mathematics. I’m expat so I can’t really visit the colleges. I’m an Asian. Based on their rankings, I’m leaning towards Colby but my parents are skeptical about racism issues at all 3 colleges.
I won’t be interested in partying. All I need is academics and solid networking. Also I heard that Skidmore gives first year students a triple to dorm?! That’s uncomforting to hear. What about the other 2? I’m preferring single or at the very least a double.
Colby has no loan package, not sure about bates, skidmore counts loans in its financial aid.
@MYOS1634 @aquapt

2.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Yes it’s true about triples at Skidmore.
Singles are exceedingly rare and considered bad for 1st year students since it isolates them more from the community.
Anyway: Sounds like it’s Bates or Colby then.  Either one is going to be very good. See if they have ED2 so that you can apply to one ED1 and the other ED2?

3.<<<DexterTom>>>
@MYOS1634, Okay, both have ED2. But Colby is #11 and bates #21. That is quite a lot of difference in the rankings. Also I see bates has more white population than Colby.

4.<<<MYOS1634>>>
That’s not a LOT considering there are thousands of colleges. Quality of education will be similar.

5.<<<gardenstategal>>>
For economics, especially if you like math, Colby is a great choice.  Also, it has exceptional career services.  (And there are often a couple of research opportunities in economics over the summer.  Competitive to get.)  You should run the NPC before applying to check on affordability.   I would recommend looking carefully at the course catalog and degree/general requirements for each of your finalists to make sure you like the way the program is set up.  They are similar in some ways but not exactly.
I know a handful of Asian American students at Colby (certainly not the whole universe, mostly athletes - and all from NJ) who have not experienced racism at the school but have commented that Maine itself feels very white, occasionally uncomfortably so.
You will not get a single your freshman year at Colby.   Freshman get doubles and triples. The latter are not “forced”, in that they have always been triples, but they are not necessarily terribly big.  With that said, if you choose a substance free dorm, I think it is likely that it will have only doubles. Housing in subsequent years can be VERY nice, and you could conceivably have a single in each of the following 3 years.
Really,  you can’t go wrong with any of your choices.  All excellent schools.

6.<<<merc81>>>
Colby registers an overall score in U.S. News of 88. Bates lands at 85. On a 100 point scale, this represents a small difference. Both Colby and Bates offer economics departments with accomplished faculty: https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.uslacecon.html. Note, however, that Bates only recently established its computer science major, so this may be an aspect you should research further.

7.<<<xyz123a>>>
S is double majoring in CS and Econ at Colby.  He speaks very highly of the head of the CS department as well as the other CS profs whose classes he has taken.  Seems to be a quickly growing program at Colby.  Similar experience for Econ.  It is a popular major, so sometimes it is difficult to get into a class, but he seems to figure it out each term.  Overall he really loves Colby.  He is not a party kid and has found great friends who are similar.  He was in a triple freshman year, but not many kids are placed in triples.  His room was huge, so although he was concerned at first, it was not an issue at all for him.  He has a very close friend at Bates who is very happy there, however I am not familiar with their CS or Econ programs.  I will say that Bates and Skidmore tend to have the reputation of being more artsy while Colby is more outdoorsy if that matters to you at all.  Bates is more integrated into the town, while Colby sits outside of the town center, but has a shuttle bus system.  All are great schools, good luck!!

8.<<<DexterTom>>>
Going for Colby ED! Do they cover first time international flight ticket costs? Not a deciding factor, just wanted to know.

9.<<<DexterTom>>>
Also, in the dorm mate assignment, do we get people from the same gender or is it mixed like male and female in the same dorm?

10.<<<xyz123a>>>
Dorms at Colby are co-ed.  You will share a room and bathroom with students of  your gender, but males and females reside in the same dorms.

11.<<<aquapt>>>
Maybe this will help

One should not base their application decisions on USNews rankings, any more than one should decide who to marry based on how well that person ranked in a beauty pageant.

13.<<<lookingforward>>>
Nor base them on how many beds in a freshman dorm room. Or, what parents think.
If you’d like an admit to a highly selective or selective college, you need to be the sort who can determine match, whether you fit what they want, figure out if a dept suits you, etc.
What sort of racism?  Can’t you look into various clubs, events, and support at target colleges?

14.<<<Empireapple>>>
Skidmore has a location that feels less isolated to me than both of your Maine choices.   Is that important to you?    I would not let a triple discourage you.  It would be fine and part of what the college experience is - learning to be more flexible.
Colby and Bates are great too.    I’d start with geographic preference and campus type and go from there.  I find Colby to much more beautiful than Skidmore.  I also find Lewiston…well, just not appealing.  On the other hand, Saratoga is very appealing.

15.<<<lookingforward>>>
We don’t even know if OP is qualified for those colleges or knows what they look for, just what he wants.

16.<<<Publisher>>>
OP: In my opinion, you are receiving some great advice in this thread, especially the  accurate post above (#13) of @Empireapple.
Saratoga Springs is one of the most attractive college locations in the US & Lewiston is among the least desirable. However, if location & surroundings are not important to you, then these observations may not be relevant.

Much more? So much more? Not much more? (With the typo, this isn’t fully clear.)

18.<<<Empireapple>>>
merc81…sorry, I have an old keyboard with several sticky keys.   Ignore the “to”.
I do not care for the Skidmore campus but I love Colby.   JMHO and my personal taste.

19.<<<Empireapple>>>
But I love Saratoga, just not the Skidmore campus.

20.<<<merc81>>>
@Empireapple: Thanks. Yes, Colby hit its Georgian look. Skidmore’s campus misses any particular defining description, though its entranceway is beautiful.

21.<<<happy1>>>
In all honesty I’d be very hesitant to apply to any of these fine LACs without a visit.   From what I experienced when we looked at different LACs with my D each school had a distinct vibe – she felt she could fit in well at some LACs while others didn’t seem to suit her as well.  IMO that sense of fit is way more important than the ranking, campus esthetics etc.
IMO a person should only apply ED if both of the following conditions are true:

The applicant has a clear top choice school AND
The family has no need/desire to compare financial offers among different colleges.
Sounds to me like you don’t have a top choice and that finances are a consideration so why is there a “need” to apply ED?


22.<<<Ennab>>>
If you are looking only at academics and ‘networking’, why go to a school that values community?  Why go to a small LAC?  Bates is great and fosters community.  When a school is evaluating your application and wants to get a sense of what you plan to contribute to the community, what will they see?

23.<<<doschicos>>>
Saratoga Springs is lovely - for middle aged moms.    I don’t think of it having much of a college town feel to it, though.
I agree that one shouldn’t apply ED without a visit. @happy1’s post above is spot on.

24.<<<DexterTom>>>
Okay, some of the many colleges on my list have an optional rec letter option from a family member. I want to know is it appropriate to get a family member’s letter of rec? How do they see it?

25.<<<DexterTom>>>
@Ennab, what do you mean by ‘plan to contribute to the community’? I can’t contribute any monetary funds. Is it volunteering work? You know I’m on the other side of the world so don’t mind explaining further. What???

26.<<<doschicos>>>
How will you be a part of the community? Other than attending classes, how will you engage on campus? Activities, clubs, teams, leadership roles, etc.

27.<<<Sue22>>>
I think it’s a mistake to choose a college based on rankings, but if you are considering them you may want to look at a range of rankings.

Colleges want you to contribute to their community. It means having skills you can share, for instance joining a team or club and helping it win because you’re very good at something, or, having shown ability to organize something so you hope to organize it again on campus or use that experience to develop x y or z… They don’t want students who spend all their time in their room doing nothing but study. Your presence should make a difference for other people.

29.<<<Publisher>>>
@MYOS1634 summed it up in a succinct manner: “Your presence should make a difference for other people.”

30.<<<Sue22>>>
@DexterTom
Although all three are great schools I would be concerned about applying anywhere ED without visiting first. For instance all three schools on this current list are in places with cold snowy winters. Have you spent time in a cold climate?
If you need financial aid that’s another reason to apply RD. Colby is the richest of the three and has a no-loan policy. Bates has the lowest average debt upon graduation of the three. Skidmore offers a number of merit scholarship while Bates and Colby are primarily need only. Which will come up with the best financial package for you? It’s hard to know.
Why do you need to go ED at one of the schools? If you were my child I’d advise you to apply RD to the wider list of schools on your original list then find a way to revisit once you know your final options.
How often does your school send students to these schools or schools like them? We don’t know your stats so it’s possible you’re an exceedingly strong candidate and would be easily accepted to all three, but I’ve seen students, particularly students from abroad, overestimate their chances at these schools. As others have noted up thread, these are tight knit communities that are looking for more than just academics when considering candidates.

31.<<<Theoden>>>
You are getting excellent advice here.  Applying ED commits you going there. Colby and Bates are need-based with financial aid, so is Skidmore but, it seems, it also has some merit aid (which rewards academic accomplishments).
Any of these schools will provide an excellent education with strong alumni networking/career offices. They will all connect you with good internships and experiential education.
Since you are mainly interested in academics and networking (I presume for job prospects) what is attracting you to these particular  schools? They are heavy on emphasizing a broad liberal arts education, they also want students who want to contribute to the campus culture by joining clubs, participating in student government, etc.
It sounds like you may be more suited to a larger university with a heavy pre-professional emphasis.

32.<<<DexterTom>>>
They are test optional and meet need. And are reputable on Wall St.

Hmmm. I am not sure I would choose any of these 3 schools if your goal is to work on Wall St (assuming that based on your reputable statement).
With that said, while it is certainly possible to get to where you want to go with these 3 schools, Colby would be the best choice IMO.

34.<<<lookingforward>>>
Let any of those 3 see this is about post grad Wall St and forget it. This is about the 4 years, not your personal career goals. What do you really know about these 3 and what they expect from you?  Applying blind is not a good idea.  You have a lot to prove in the full app.
We get that you want one of them.  But what makes them want to pick you?

35.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Op lives abroad and certainly wishes he could visit, but that’s just not within the realm of possibility, nor how it works for internationals who need financial aid (they would not be needing financial aid if they could visit).
In addition, for an international who needs a lot of aid, ED is the best bet. Turns 1% odds into 3% (literally).
@DexterTom :
If you’re applying test optional, you need a stellar record (like AAA) AND something they want.
What do you have that they want?
(cricket captain, grand Master chess player, national youth party leader, etc.)

36.<<<Ennab>>>
i don’t mean monetarily in any way. But many LAC are looking for how you give to the community by participating on campus-  what kind of roommate will you be?, how will you participate in campus events, organizations, etc. I hope that helps.

37.<<<privatebanker>>>
All excellent academically and have strong reputations. That being said, they are a bit different culturally in terms of student focus and campus vibe.
So please take these as grand generalizations but within it is some directional truth. Imho.
Skidmore is arguably one of the most passionate “student activist” type cultures in the USA.  It’s part of the attraction for many students.  It would hold the opposite appeal for others.
Colby is a pretty remote location.  Gorgeous and socially active.  It also can be more oriented around the “weekend festivities” than others due to the location.
Bates is probably a bit of both.  It’s also a very strong brand in banking and finance in the northeast USA.
If I had to choose one based on your specific observations.  I would choose Bates.  Location. Portland and Boston. Access to airports. Outdoorsy. Diverse politically within reason.
Academically it’s a wash to me.  Bates and Colby tends to be viewed as slightly more selective in my region.  Skidmore is also considered very selective.

It appears from the original post that he/she is an expat (American citizen) not an international student.

39.<<<lookingforward>>>
@privatebanker I’d disagree about your characterizations.  In fact, at Skidmore, we couldn’t find community activation, which was a deciding point for D1. Yes, we asked.  Apparently there is high need in Saratoga, somewhat hidden to visitors.  But no one could cite activation.  I do believe any NE liberal college will have its active sorts.  I do respect the college for some very real strengths.
Bates, in contrast, puts the book in front of you- literally, a thick binder of opps to engage with the community, near and further.  Part of a center for community partnerships.  Not all kids participate routinely, sure.
All three can lead to Boston and NYC (and other) finance opps.
None of the 3 are easy to get to. Lately, a lot of posts talk about Colby’s beauty.  But Bates is no slouch in that dept and I find poor little Lewiston to be intriguing. (In that way New Englanders can sometimes appreciaite former mill towns and their evolution.)
But the bigger issue to me is that we’re putting the cart before the horse, not knowing if OP has the record to get into one of the 3. His questions hint he doesn’t understand what it takes. Eg, what it means to “contribute to the community.”  That it’s not simply academics and networking, they vet for more.  It leads me to question if he knows these schools versus just that they can serve him.  Not how it works.
And the question about family LoRs refers to homeschooling. First, each college gives instructions and it generally should be someone who oversaw the high school years, there’s an intent to the LoR, it’s not just commentary (nice kid, works hard.)  And 2nd, for homeschool, it’s often tough to meet their expectations when you describe isolation and main focus on academics.  How will OP show engagement, in ways these colleges want to see?  So, again, does he understand what it takes?

40.<<<DexterTom>>>
Well, @lookingforward, you have questioned my abilities but you have not read my original post properly. This thread is not about me or whether I can get in to them or not. It’s plain and simple English- given the 3 colleges and had to pick one based on few general observations for ED. It’s not whether I’ll get in or not. Let me do that job myself. I’ve come here only for listening to what 100 people say with 100 different opinions as something is always better than nothing and I’m abroad, so posters above especially @MYOS1634 , @privatebanker , @merc81 helped a lot.
That’s all I need to know. This is not about me, it’s about the colleges. And whether I fit in or not or whether they consider me fit, I’ll take care of that.
My apologies if this came out rude but I can’t just keep calm and watch when somebody can’t comprehend a question and it’s requirement written in plain English.

41.<<<gardenstategal>>>
Folks, in #7, OP had made a decision.   The deadline for submission is 11/15, and the common advice is to not wait until the last minute so as to avoid IT glitches that could make the app late.  Why is everyone asking the OP to second guess the decision?  I am sure we all want to be helpful but in the context of the question, the fact that OP is an expat and cannot visit, are we helping?
Personally,  I would not want my kid to ED to any school without visiting first (in part because the social environment was important to him and he wanted to be active in the community.).  Each of these schools has a different “dominant culture,” and the OP sounds like he may be on the edge/outside of that at all of these.  That doesn’t mean no friends and no social life – at most schools,  most kids find their peeps.
This applicant seems to want to ED, and if he’s strong applicant,  that’s good strategy…
I am guessing (but I could be wrong) based on the question about first time airfare that OP may not visit ANY college prior to matriculation.

42.<<<lookingforward>>>
I’ll answer my “why,” @gardenstategal.
Because Skidmore will be the easier admit. Apparently OP isn’t basing this on fit, which is more than what he wants.
The colleges will look for that. Hope he gives them that. He makes his decision.  They make theirs.

43.<<<Sue22>>>

I don’t mean to be argumentative, but @DexterTom it is about you and whether you can get in. What’s the point of applying ED to a school where you have little chance, won’t be happy with the academic fit, or can’t afford to attend?
For instance, you feel you must apply ED. ED admissions rates are much higher than RD rates at these schools, but do you know why? All recruited athletes, a class that can have a north of 90% acceptance rate, are heavily encouraged to apply ED, as are legacies, who usually receive preferential treatment only in the ED round. Students with little to no financial need are also over represented in the ED pool. Take those factors into account and the ED bump becomes negligible.
The advice we would give you if you’re a 1580 SAT 4.0 UW GPA student is different from the advice we’d give you if you’re a 3.6 student with a 1380.
In any case, I wish you the best in your journey. Colby’s a great school. 

44.<<<Lindagaf>>>
If your goal is simply to have the best chance of getting in, then ED to Skidmore. Did we ever see what this person’s grades and scores are? I’m totally guessing that OP perhaps doesn’t have super strong grades and is applying ED as a boost to compensate.
Also, no, I highly doubt any of the colleges will pay your international airfare, unless perhaps you have been part of a low SES, first gen, or URM recruitment program.

45.<<<Theoden>>>
@DexterTom  I missed that you went for Colby ED.  Great school, best of luck!

46.<<<privatebanker>>>
@lookingforward    They are my observations.   Also if you think Bates has a higher SJW vibe than Skidmore.  We simply disagree.  This is based on personal observation and the students I know who attend both schools personally.  But it’s in degrees anyway.  Like I said.  Generalizations.

47.<<<privatebanker>>>
Also.  When I said activism, I was not referencing community service and outreach.  I meant more of the protest and super progressive liberalism construct. In all it’s manifestations.   Speech.  Social groups. Student clubs and activities. That sort of thing.  And we are talking about Northeast liberal arts colleges.  They are all very close in these matters.
To me it was more about the types of talented kids that seem to self select for each school.  Small differences of course.
Good luck.

48.<<<DexterTom>>>
And I’ve already applied ED to Colby so any of your further inputs here won’t be of use. I’m anxiously waiting for the decisions to come out.

@DexterTom Why did you post the above in post #31 if your test scores are as you claim?

50.<<<DexterTom>>>
@doschinos, I want apply to a college that is test optional. Because I believe that one sitting on a test date isn’t an accurate portrayal of the student’s abilities. While you may say 1580 on a SAT is excellent, I’m in Asia and the competition is very, very tough and 1600 is the only acceptable score in this country. I don’t have time to take another SAT and perfect that. So that’s why I’m choosing a test optional school. I have self reported the SAT II, AP test score even though the colleges don’t require it.
But all in all, test optional is path that I’ve chosen.

51.<<<gardenstategal>>>
I understand your frustration.  But you need to be polite!  And you should submit that 1580.  Now!  You don’t understand the system if you think that a score like that would detract from your application.   Quite the opposite.

52.<<<DexterTom>>>
But @gardenstategal , applicants from my country are usually having 1600 (all of them have got it in the 2nd or 3rd attempt). And I don’t have test date available (next one is in March) to perfect that score. Will that 1580 be a mole on my application as other applicants from my country sport 1600s?
And I already submitted my CommonApp, how can I send them now. That’s not possible, I guess.

53.<<<Hippobirdy>>>
You’re a US citizen? Does Colby consider US citizens abroad differently - not like foreign citizens? Contact Colby Admissions rep directly.

54.<<<DexterTom>>>
@Hippobirdy , I’ll be treated as a US Citizen all over but my admissions file will be reviewed by an International counselor

55.<<<xyz123a>>>
@DexterTom,  @gardenstategal gives you great advice.  Contact the College Board and have your SAT score sent immediately. If you put a rush on your scores, they may very well get to Colby by the ED deadline of 11/15.  As test scores are sent directly from the testing agency to the college, it is common for these scores to arrive after the rest of the application.  Your score is excellent and will only strengthen your application!  Good luck!!

56.<<<Lindagaf>>>
In America, 1580 is a fantastic score. Not submitting it is weakening your app.
A perfect 1600 is not going to get you in. Not to Colby or Harvard. It’s going to be the other stuff.
So you applied test optional because you thought 1580 was a strike against you? It isn’t. You should submit it.
