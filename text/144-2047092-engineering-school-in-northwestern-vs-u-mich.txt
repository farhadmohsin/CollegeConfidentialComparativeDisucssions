My daughter is accepted into the Engineering school at U of I (in state), U Mich and Northwestern.  U Mich and Northwestern both offer merit scholarship that nearly matches the in-state tuition of U of I.  Daughter has written U of I off because she does not like the campus.  We have not had the chance to visit Ann Arbor.  The tour of U Mich Engineering school on the days that I’m able to take vacation is all booked although I still plan to drive to Ann Arbor for a general campus tour (we live in Chicago).  Due to the proximity, daughter has heard a lot about and leaning toward Northwestern.  I’d appreciate opinions from those who have intimate knowledge of both programs/campuses.

2.<<<sushiritto>>>
@Knowsstuff has a sophomore/junior in UMich Engineering and lives on North Campus, which is where the Engineering Campus is located. He/she can fill you in on the details. He/she also lives in the Chicago area.
I’m a parent of a freshman in LSA, so I’d be happy to fill you in on any other details at UMich.

3.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Great options on the table!
I think one of the biggest differences is the quarter vs semester system.  NU stresses the ability to easily add double majors or minors but students are jumping into their classes immediately with no ramp up because the quarters are so short.
There is also a huge size difference between the two school.
Can you send your DD to Michigan alone?    Lots of students will make those visits without parents.

4.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@phoebehana4. @sushiritto speaks the truth. I live in Chicago and my son went to one of the well known and number 1 selective enrollment high schools. He was excepted to both as well and didn’t want to go to either since we live closer to Northwestern and none of us cared for UIUC school /grounds /attitude towards engineering students. He also wanted to go to school with kids with his type of stats. Northwestern and Michigan would provide that as the students are similar. He is in Industrial engineering and Michigan is ranked second in the world in that. He was wait listed from Georgia Tech which was first.
My son lived on Central campus his first year and on North husk second. He likes both for different reasons. Keep in mind you can live anywhere you want to including apartments all 4 years but Michigan randomly places you the first year anyhow.
His school is like a feeder for Northwestern and University of Chicago. He spent 3 weeks on Northwestern campus doing a year of stats in 3 weeks in 11 th grade summer with 12 other kids. They called that fun and thought it was easy. He really didn’t care for the campus. He told me he does less walking to campus now then he did in NW campus. They lived in Dorms there also. I actually love both campuses. There is just a different feel when at Michigan to us. You “need” to visit Michigan now question. Both central and North campus can look baren depending on the day. Both have great school spirit. They are close educationally and again have students. Both have great campuses.These two schools are more similar then different. My son wanted to go away to school. Going to NW was to close for his likening. He would be home on the El in less then 30 minutes… Lol…
My son is the chairperson of an augmented /mixed reality conference this weekend. Go and see what student’s actually do in the spare time 11 lectures and 20 exhibits. If you need to know more how Michigan supports their engineering students PM me. Have to go into surgery now.

5.<<<simba9>>>
I’d say both schools are good enough so that this would boil down to an issue of where your daughter feels most comfortable.
Absolutely everyone I know who went to Michigan loves the school and Ann Arbor.

6.<<<phoebehana4>>>
Thanks to everyone’s comments.  Personally, although I have never been to Ann Arbor, I feel that Ann Arbor is a better choice for a young adult learning to be independent. NU students are required to live in dorm for the first two years.  When they do live off campus, they end up living in Rogers park or somewhere in the city and take CTA to school.  In comparison, Ann Arbor is cheaper in housing and safer for new drivers (she has yet learned to drive).  Daughter does like the ease to double major in NU.  I also suspect that she is more impressionable to the perceived “elite” status of NU. So are many of her friends who have been accepted into both.
Other than the different feels of these two towns, ultimately I would like to compare these two engineering schools.  Daughter is very strong in STEM but her interests are very broad. Although she picked mechanical engineering, her initially love was chemistry and more recently she is talking about biomedical engineering or environmental sciences.  The UMich scholarship is contingent upon her declaration of engineering major at the end of freshman year while NU scholarship does not have any restriction.  Thus my questions are - How easy is it to switch from one engineering major to another in UMich? How easy is it to double major in UMich (for example, mechanical engineering major and environmental biology minor?)

7.<<<StanfordGSB00>>>
@phoebehana4 - I am pasting what I wrote in another similar thread. Both are great schools.  I would recommend Northwestern because it is more exclusive / elite at the undergraduate level. Most students at Michigan cannot get into Northwestern, except maybe the top 10-20%. Top 10 in USNews vs. Top 30. And now to SAT / ACT scores, Northwestern has had significantly higher scores for many many years compared to Michigan. About a 100 point difference in SAT average until the last year, when scores have been re-centered (causing the scores to converge towards the top). And it is not just about test scores when it comes to exclusive, elite admissions - Harvard could enroll a class with a 1600 perfect SAT average. They are looking for very talented, unique individuals. Northwestern / Duke / Dartmouth, Stanford, etc. could similarly enroll a class with a 1550 SAT average if they wanted to but UMichigan could not. Go look at the RD decisions threads for these schools and you’ll see a ton of students with 1500+ SAT scores / 34+ ACT scores (with perfect grades) rejected on the regular.
Northwestern is significantly more impressive on the pedigree level / resume. Why would you pay the same amount of $$$$ to go to a large public school (which is still awesome but not quite the same level as NW) when you can go an elite private school with more resources, a higher caliber student body, smaller classes, etc. It is extremely easy to switch in/out of Engineering and go into WCAS / Engineering. I think this is a no brainer to go Northwestern if money is no issue. If Michigan was giving a full-ride scholarship, then I would say Michigan could be a great option. But, in this instance, I would go to Northwestern and switch in / out of engineering (to Arts / Sciences). Or double major, etc. UMichigan alums will disagree here but if money is not a factor, 90% of students are choosing NW over UMichigan. Good luck and congrats on the acceptances

Northwestern University offers some certificate programs that merge different areas of study. For example, there should be at least one certificate program for engineering in conjunction with the graduate business school (Kellogg School of Business) and several others that make grads very attractive to a variety of employers.
Because the Michigan scholarship has a major contingency while the Northwestern University award does not, the choice is clear.
Good news is that she will be able to attend either school for graduate school if in her plans.
P.S. Agree that the quarter system allows for more flexibility in areas of study & for double majoring or adding minors to a major.
Also, Northwestern University has a significant Greek presence–especially sororities.

9.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
Most people at NU have at least a minor on top of their major if not having two majors. It seems that the school has a strong history of fostering interdisciplinary pursuit and creating interdisciplinary curriculum like “engineering first” back in 1997 and MMSS as well as ISP way back in the 70s.
Another strong point not reflected in any ranking is the financial support NU give for undergraduate research. Last year, they received 203 applications and funded 134 proposals. These are original research during the school year, not counting the independent summer research or ones led by graduate students/professors.
Two years ago, total funds for undergraduate research were $1.3 million for 563 projects, a 365% increase over a 10-year period. The number of applications were around 900 which means majority of applications were granted. The number is even higher now (though I don’t have the figure).
JHU may be number 1 in research funding, but their list of UNDERGRADUATE summer research winners is way shorter than NU. This just goes to show how you absolutely can’t go by those rankings.

10.<<<sushiritto>>>
@Knowsstuff Hopefully, you’re the doctor and not the patient. 
Just from a cursory look at the UMich CoE website, adding or combining majors and/or minors, whether in LSA or Music/Dance/Theater, as examples, doesn’t appear to be that difficult other than actually taking the extra courses.
https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/ug-ed/other-minors/
https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/ug-ed/degrees/
I know for my LSA STEM kid, adding 5 additional LSA courses, will get an additonal minor in a STEM subject. UMich also gives credit for AP courses taken in HS, so it’s not as bad as it sounds. As an example, a 5 in AP Calc BC removed then need to take Calc 1 and 2.
From what I read here, NU doesn’t have much school spirit, at least in terms of sports. Just recently, someone posted that NU gives away FREE tickets to sports (football, basketball, etc.) in order to get students to games. Let’s just say UMich doesn’t have that problem. Basketball games are sold out and 111,000 of your closest friends pack the Big House each and every home Saturday date. UMich competes for national championships, NU not as much. School spirit matters for some but not others. It mattered for my kid.

11.<<<momofsenior1>>>
I live very near NU and it was next to impossible to come by football tickets this Fall.      I wouldn’t say school spirit is lacking at NU.

12.<<<osuprof>>>
One factor to consider is that Northwestern Undergrad Engineering is around 400 students per  year, whereas Michigan is more like 1600!. Michigan has more faculty in engineering, but not by a factor of 4 (less than factor of 2). What it means is smaller class sizes on average at NU and more access to faculty.

13.<<<sushiritto>>>
I’m conveying another person’s thoughts on NU. Personally I have no clue about NU. However, student tickets are free for all sporting events. Just show your ID.

“I live very near NU and it was next to impossible to come by football tickets this Fall. I wouldn’t say school spirit is lacking at NU.”
I’ve been to games at NU where opposing teams fans are a far greater presence than anywhere else in the B1G. Of course being located near Chicago is the main reason for this.

Perhaps you confused Michigan with OSU?  Facilities and accessibility are far more telling of quality than smaller class size.  I never hear anyone at Michigan having problems getting access to their professors.  With that in mind, Michigan and NU are both excellent in engineering.  The OP needs to decide over which school offers him/her a better fit.

18.<<<Publisher>>>
Northwestern football should be excellent over the next three or four years for several reasons including the new quarterback who was the first or second highest rated QB prospect coming out of high school 2 years ago.
OP’s concern, however, is with the academic side. Northwestern should offer a greater number of small classes.

19.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
It’s engineering folks. I’d be more concerned over getting my needed courses and the quality of the facilities/faculty than getting into slightly smaller classes.

20.<<<sushiritto>>>
From the Daily Northwestern, regarding the student section aka “school spirit,” not the raw numbers, since NU is simply a smaller school than most FBS power-conference teams:

[quote]
Not only does NU rank in the bottom quartile of FBS power-conference teams in overall attendance — its average of 35,853 last year ranked 58th among 65 such teams — but the student section is often the emptiest part of the stadium, with only roughly a quarter to a third of it filled (based on the eye test) on average days.
[/quote]

https://dailynorthwestern.com/2018/08/24/lateststories/northwestern-football-attendance-ryan-field-big-ten/
Capacity of Northwestern’s football stadium is 47,000 (rounded).

21.<<<sushiritto>>>
FWIW, and it’s not much, but NU did sell-out 4 of its 7 home games. Those sell-outs were against the following teams:
Notre Dame
Michigan
Wisconsin
Nebraska
NU had a very good football team last year, they went to the Big10 Championship, but Nebraska? 

22.<<<momofsenior1>>>
I have to say that there were a TON of Nebraska fans walking around that weekend, all decked out in their bright red gear.

23.<<<newsworthy>>>
@phoebehana4
As an alum of NU (Chem Engineering) I can strongly endorse NU. The co-op program at NU was very rewarding for me both academically and professionally (I think Michigan has one too) and the smaller overall enrollment allows students to easily make friends with those outside of one’s major as well as have more personal interactions with professors. The name recognition of NU as a “top ten” school can also open doors. I loved the campus situated on Lake Michigan, and the school has invested recently in spectacular new world class facilities, from sciences to sports to business school to music.
Now to my favorite topic: NU football. The school just opened a $400 million facility right on Lake Michigan with million-dollar views of the Chicago skyline. There is a full-size indoor football field with one wall of glass looking out onto the lake. Students can use the Athletic center that is part of the complex.  The coach is the legendary alum Pat Fitzgerald who is on a 10-year contract (after turning down an offer from Michigan) and just won the Big 10 West championship last year going 8-1, not to mention topping off the season with his 3rd straight bowl win. The program will continue to compete for championships.
Basketball went to the NCAA tournament two years ago (beating Michigan to basically clinch a spot), and opened the newly renovated Welsh-Ryan arena this season to rave reviews. The fans may not be present in huge numbers, but they are just as fanatical and it can be a loud, rocking environment.
There is a very active Greek life, but non-Greek life can be enjoyable too with residential colleges, etc. The proximity to Chicago is a plus, and Evanston itself has been transformed into a vibrant city with trendy restaurants and shops within the past decade.
If the financial side of the equation is taken care of by merit scholarships, it is a no-brainer to pick NU.  Just my biased view. 

24.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
“…it is a no brainer to pick NU.”  That kind of remark is not helpful at all to a student deciding between these two peer universities.

@Publisher that’s a big one, NU would be the place to go.  Only 30% of my freshman class graduated with me in engineering back in the day.  You also need to take a hard look at 4 year graduation rates in engineering at each university.  An extra year or two will cost serious money.

Compete for Big10 West championships? Yes. Compete for Big 10 Championships? Maybe, but highly unlikely. Winning the Big10 would require down years from UMich, Ohio State, MSU or Penn State (aka Big10 East Champion. Compete for National Championships? No.
Oh, and that one conference loss was to…UMich. Last season, Ohio State and Penn State weren’t on NU’s schedule.
As for NU basketball making the NCAA tournament two years ago, well, that was their ONLY NCAA appearance in at least the last 20 years.

Although veering off the OP’s topic, check out Northwestern’s football QB. Should make NU very competitive for the next several years. I believe that he was a five star recruit.

32.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
OP never even mentioned sports attendance is a big deal. I would think someone interested in sports journalism would have already had some idea.
On top of the great funding for independent research, someone mentioned co-op at NU. It’s one of the oldest and most established co-op in the country. It has 1/3 participation rate. It’s a cool program where you alternate between work term and class term so you get to integrate work experience into classroom and vice versa better than if you were to do summer internships. It’s also easier to get because the spots are already kinda prearranged; you still have to interview but the competition will be much less than summer internships where you compete against people from anywhere.

@phoebehana4
First been to both for football games and at NW you will have more of opposing school fans then NW fans hands down and very small stadium. Nice but like a high school size. Michigan is more like a religious experience… Plainly, even if your not into sports it’s just fun!
My son just paid for his football season tickets a few days ago. Both schools anyone can get tickets on Stubhub etc.
As far as scholarships Michigan gives out very few most are Michigan grants. Money is money no problem there… Don’t worry about declaring they treat you like family and are very interested in your child success. This is very rare at a large school. Don’t believe me, email the head of the department or engineering admissions etc and see how you are treated. It is vastly different between these two schools.
As far as majoring /minoring etc switching majors at anytime etc. Very easy at Michigan. They will support any of your choices. You can do anything you want at Michigan engineering and the school will support the kids. My son is living proof of that. Engineering with a music minor is big at both schools. Combine anything with anything at Michigan, not a problem.
As far of the comments of prestige… Seems we have some NW fans coming on this thread… Haha… . Both great schools. In Chicago proper the perception is Michigan is a bigger deal and harder to get into. Engineering is 3.93(unweighted) with 33/34 Act. I don’t think NW is much higher then that. Michigan lsa is 3.83 with 32/33 and both higher for OOS. So please stop the mine is shiner then yours crap! It’s not helping the OP or anyone. Both are world-class universities. Both have world class research facilities. Both have world class hospital systems.
For the poster comparing private VS public… Michigan runs like a private school but who cares. 11 billion in reserves, I think their doing OK.
Here is something that no one has addressed and alert… It’s a serious subject .
Both schools for engineering are very hard. Michigan claims at least a full grade drop from Freshman to Senior year in engineering. Maintaining a “b” avg is not as easy as it seems. Stress! How each school handles this is different. There have been a record number of suicides at Northwestern in the last few years. We actually know of two of them. If your students need this type of help or counseling prior to admission please check out both schools and how they handle this. This is Not a reason not to go to NW BTW. But something to look into.
There is an engineering class that goes into all the disciplines. I recommend doing that. When visiting Michigan make an appointment with a professor or head of your department or peer student. This should open up your eyes on the school.
Both schools intertwine the creative minds like engineering , theater/arts , design majors, medical. This is what North Campus is made of for Michigan. When you go there you will see this group of large blah buildings. Well, some of the world’s leading research is being done that your child can participate in, in those blah buildings.
Alumni is strong at both schools if the students reach out.
You don’t have a bad decision here. It really comes down to fit /feel of the schools. Both schools have really smart kids that will challenge each other. It depends on how competitive your child wants the environment. My son wanted this environment coming from the type of high school he went to. It was what he was used to, good or bad.
Again you just need to visit Michigan to see what’s its like. Please pm me if you want inside information on engineering and opportunities that exists at Michigan. Again, you can do anything you want to there.

37.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
Class size. Sorry my son’s Calc and other classes some had 20 students others have more. You can meet with professors /t/a etc easily. This is college and not high school. I am sure both have 150 people in some classes. My son said it’s really not an issue if you have questions. Etc I know at Michigan you can type your question live and it’s answered right there and then if you don’t want to to raise your hand. Forgot the name of the program they use for it. If you need more explanation just email, ask the professor live (crazy huh? ?), go to office hours. Peer to peer labs etc etc. If you need the help it’s there for the taking. More students doesn’t mean less instruction.

38.<<<StanfordGSB00>>>
@Knowsstuff - “In Chicago proper the perception is Michigan is a bigger deal and harder to get into.” LOL. These are also the same people that think that U of Illinois is more prestigious than UChicago and Northwestern?

39.<<<JoelShoe>>>
@StanfordGSB00 I can’t help but note the most recent USN&WR ranking of Engineering schools, which seems like a fair gauge of prestige. In relevant part…
5 - University of Michigan (tied with Caltech)
10 - University of Illinois
20 - Northwestern

40.<<<sushiritto>>>
@StanfordGSB00 @Knowsstuff is probably referring to just the CoE at UMich (3.9+ GPA and 34 ACT), not the entire university, which is very easy to be accepted into. 

41.<<<sushiritto>>>
In terms of undergraduate engineering programs:
6 UIUC
6 UMich
14 Northwestern

42.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
More comparisons stuff 
At NW you have to walk about 15 /20 minutes to downtown Evanston. Great downtown but limited selections for students (cost wise). Also amazing to be on the lake except my son’s t-mobile like never worked. Going downtown is of course Chicago is a world class city but newsflash… The kids I know that have been there don’t go as often as you would think. Both campuses have stuff to do there plus this crazy thing called studying ?. It is Not unusual at both schools for people to be in the library or wherever on Saturday night.
Northwestern has more of a Greek vibe but at either school you don’t have to be involved.
At Michigan the city of Ann Arbor surrounds you on Central campus. More places that are student affordable to eat at. More stores in general.
Detroit is up and coming and Midtown is really amazing. I live in Chicago but grew up outside Detroit so it’s a big change. Again cool to go downtown but it’s not done as much as people think you would go.
On North Campus it’s more like the suburbs to me. There are choices and places to go to but most of the cool places are on Central campus.
Taking the bus to central from North campus for my son just is not a big deal since we live in Chicago he took a train to a bus to school for 4 years and about 35-40 minutes each way. At Michigan it’s about 20-25 minutes door to door. For the suburban kids it might be an eye opener but not the true city kids. People make too much of this subject.
Both schools have good school spirit but I would challenge that Michigan has “Great” school spirit. Both schools are very proud of their students and Alumni!
Both have engineering study abroad programs. My sons going to France for an engineering study abroad then he just found out today was accepted to go to Israel for an engineering internship.
What am I missing?
I can’t find the article but Michigan was voted to have the best school uniform. There you go, that should be your deciding factor. Lol… ?.

43.<<<Publisher>>>
@Knowsstuff : OP has a scholarship to Northwestern and a contingent scholarship to Michigan that seems to kick in only after freshman year if engineering is declared as OP’s major. (It would help if OP would add more clarity to the scholarship status during OP’s freshman year at Michigan. My reading is that there is no scholarship during OP’s freshman year at Michigan, and a contingent scholarship thereafter. The Northwestern scholarship has no restrictions according to OP.)

44.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Distance to downtown Evanston totally depends on where on campus a student is living.    If you are living on the northern side of campus, absolutely 15 - 20 minute walk to Downtown.  If you are on the south side of campus, it can be less than a block to Clark St depending on dorm location.    I also think there are a ton of restaurants for students, plus many participate in the Wildcard discount.     I personally love Ann Arbor but think Evanston is a fairly comparable college town, and with easier access into the city.
I still think the bigger differences are overall size, and quarter vs semester system.    DD also found the student body to be a bit more laid back at Michigan.

45.<<<Publisher>>>
@momofsenior1 : I agree that Michigan has a more laid back student body–although it may vary by school / college within each university.
I did an internet search for “colleges with the most stressed out students”. Although Northwestern did not appear on other lists, I found one that ranked the top 10:


Harvard


Stanford


Tulane


MIT


Wake Forest University


NYU


Cornell


WashUStL


Northwestern


Univ. of Pennsylvania (Penn)


Vanderbilt, Princeton, Duke & Columbia & Chicago also ranked as schools with very stressed out students. William & Mary is another. This is a major reason that I see LACs as an easier, more comfortable transition from high school to the top ranked elite schools. I prefer National Universities for a variety of reasons, but no setting or type of school is perfect.
The article stated that 23% of Stanford students thought about suicide. Yet, at Michigan, which did not appear on this list, the University of Michigan’s own recent study revealed that 24% of Michigan students thought about suicide & that 11.3% went a step further.
Not sure what to make of this beyond preparing high achieving students who place pressure on themselves to engage in stress relieving activities such as exercise & relaxation each & every day.

46.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Those are sobering stats.     There was a suicide at my DD’s school last semester as well (also not on the list).    We need to keep giving our children the message that a bad grade, changing majors, even failing out, is not the end of the world.     I also agree with the need for balance and daily R&R.
FWIW, my DD spent a lot of time with engineers on both campuses so was comparing apples to apples in terms of her impression of “laid backness.”

I have not been to Evanston, so I cannot comment, though due to its proximity to Chicago, I’m sure it’s a great suburb/town/city.

48.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@StanfordGSB00. Not really. Everyone in Chicago that I know, knows what UIUC is and isn’t. But it’s also great for engineering. My kid didn’t want to go there and wanted the general population to be a higher GPA overall. He applied to Cornell and Georgia Tech for the same reason. Not being elitist just the environment he enjoys more. UIUC Ranked well and the kids get jobs. Again, not going into mine is shinier. There is a case to be made for all the these schools. Just trying to give a perspective since I know the 3 she mentioned well and know many that have graduated and go there currently.

49.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@momofsenior1 and @Publisher. Yes, no question that Michigan is much more laid back. I love Northwestern but what I was talking about stress and suicide is an issue. We need to support our children in anyway possible.
As far as the scholarship during freshman year, I assumed it included freshman year. Maybe I read it wrong but from the comments doesn’t seem like the financials are a major concern.
As far as prestige, I think the parents make more of this then the kids do. My sons going in 2 weeks to LA for an intercollegiate meeting that he help restart this year and he’s a board member from Michigan. They have students from USC, Harvard, Yale, Berkeley, Stanford etc on this board /team. They have all met last year in Silicon Valley at a conference and do video chat meetings. I have stated this prior but I asked my son about the kids from Stanford etc and their attitudes, personalities etc. He said all the kids are the same t-shirt wearing /blue Jean kids. All understood each other’s language and all were into geeky engineering stuff. All ate pizza and hamburgers (except for one vegan) and all laughed at the same bad jokes. He did point out that the Stanford and Berkeley kids were taller!!!
So the only people who care about what school seems to be the PARENTS. All these kids are going on to great careers and futures.

50.<<<StanfordGSB00>>>
@Knowsstuff - to suggest that the consensus among educated people (with at least a bachelor’s from a reputable college) in Chicagoland think that UMichigan is superior to Northwestern (at the undergrad level) is just patently false and misleading. Both are great schools but Northwestern (Dartmouth, Duke, at tippy top privates) are superior to UMichigan at the undergrad level, regardless of the ranking of a particular discipline. If we are talking about engineering, for instance, would you honestly recommend someone choose UMichigan engineering over Harvard, even though it has a lower undergrad engineering ranking? People pay too much attention to particular graduate rankings but the overall reputation of the school is more important. Both are great schools but Northwestern is the better option for most students, if in-state tuition (for Michigan) is not a consideration. Northwestern will provide more resources, more opportunities, smaller classes, better instruction at the undergrad level, and better resume pedigree (believe it or not).

“Northwestern will provide more resources, more opportunities, smaller classes, better instruction at the undergrad level, and better resume pedigree (believe it or not).”
Hyperbole and simply not true.  There is also no way you can prove the instruction will be better at NU.
Furthermore, I would not recommend Harvard over Michigan for engineering if the OP really wanted to be a working engineer.
Once again, NU is not Stanford.  Even Harvard is not Stanford.  You are assuming that all top private’s are better choices that all top publics.  This is also not true.  The top public schools in CA, as great as they are, do not have the funding/endowment that a school like Michigan has.  Michigan acts like a semi-private university.

52.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
I have been to Evanston. It is meh in my opinion. It does not have the vibe of a great college town like Ann Arbor, especially for an 18-22 yo.

53.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@StanfordGSB00. Sorry wrong… Yes, I was making a broad generalization but I live here and talk with parents, students etc. Both are great schools. Harvard is NOT better in engineering. Please entertain this question on the engineering forum and get ready for the reaction. It has been done prior. You evidently don’t have the knowledge on this topic. NW doesn’t have better opportunities,more resources, smaller classes, better instruction on any level or better pedigree. Not sure what fantasy you are living in. Kids from either school will do great in the job market. Love to see your proof for these opinions…
This is also not helping the OP and derailing this thread. Yes, we all feel fondly of certain schools. Whether one is better is up to the applicant.
In engineering the first year engineers in large firms are from NW, Michigan, Georgia Tech, UIUC and so on but also from Kettering, Michigan Tech and some unknown schools in Europe. All the engineers work together. One is not better then the other. They are all first year and have a lot to learn. Each school has its strengths and weakness’s. Yes certain school might be superior in one field over another.
In industrial engineering undergraduate Michigan is ranked 2 and Northwestern is ranked 7. Does this mean Michigan is that much better?
Maybe? /Maybe not. They all seem to get jobs in the same types of firms.

It is great fun reading these back-and-forths!  Uniform - who would have thought of that!
Regarding the scholarship - this is the exact language …
The Engineering Scholarship of Honor is granted for four years of undergraduate study or upon graduation, whichever occurs first. Recipients of the Engineering Scholarship of Honor must declare their engineering major by the end of the freshman year.  The criteria  for continuation each year are full-time enrollment in the College of Engineering and a minimum cumulative GPA of 3 …

55.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@phoebehana4. That awesome. Congrats! Is that the Michigan one? Anyway… So just declare. You can always switch to something else. Call the scholarship office for more clarification.
The avg GPA at Michigan engineering is 3.3 according to them. It’s doable.
FYI. https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/college/ct-spt-viz-big-ten-basketball-uniforms-ranked-20190311-story.html

As a funny aside, I was at master’s class tonight at Northwestern.  There were a ton of students in the audience.   At one point the guest lecturer stopped and commented that he knew he must be at a Big 10 school because of the enthusiasm of the audience.     So, student attendance may not be strong at sporting events, but it sure is in the arts!

Thank everyone for your contribution to this lively debate!  You have touched on many many valid points to ponder.
@Knowsstuff, @publisher, @momofsenior1 – You are so right that striking a balance between academic rigor and care-free college life is important to consider. We live within walking distance to the other prestigious Chicago academic institution -U of C (my mater alma) and D refuses to consider it for the reason you talked about.  Many years ago, one article ranked 300 universities/colleges on their fun-lovingness.  U of C was at the bottom, lower even than BYU (where coffee drinking was prohibited) and Naval Academy.  Since then, U of C has gone on an image make-over journey to shake off that bad vibe.  At that time, NU was ranked at ~150, which was a nice perfect medium to be.
@stanfordGSB00 – I understand where you come from.  I think that NU is more homogenous in terms of students’ braininess than a large state school like UMich.  UMich clearly has a large number of high-achieving students. However, they’d be a mathematical minority due to the sheer size of the school.  Some may prefer the peer at NU because they challenge you more.  Others may prefer the peer at UMich because the competition is not as fierce and one could more easily stand out.  I guess what we should do is to find out where D stands among her cohort.
@Iwannahelp – Thanks for info on NU co-op program.  I also found their publication on their undergraduate post-graduation job status.  I read a bit on UMich CoE co-op program but have not found any post-graduation job report.
@Publisher – Would you conclude that the NU engineering programs provide additional emphasis on fostering entrepreneurship or management skills, thus, more well-rounded?
@sushiritto – Although college football is not a major factor (yet), the college spirits and the atmosphere of college town are definitely part of the package.  Like the article you posted, I am not surprised that Boulder CO is ranked number 1 (love it!).  This speaks very well of AA, being ranked number #2.
@cu123, @rjkofnovi – The terms of the UMich scholarship do cause some concern here.  D did not decide on engineering until right before the deadline of college application.  She swung from chemistry to environmental sciences to mechanical engineering and, most recently, biology.
I have secured an in-person appointment with a UMich CoE academic advisor in a week and will visit AA.  I would like the advisor to help draft a mock four-years study plan and try to get clarity on the terms of scholarship.  Obviously I will do the same with a NU advisor.  Happy to hear more ideas on what I should ask.  Thanks!

59.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
@sushiritto
NU’s R&D is $700M. On per capita basis, maybe it’s no less than UMich?  But as I mentioned in my last post, JHU was #1 in R&D but when it comes to funding for undergraduate research, it’s significantly less than NU. I think we can all agree which number is more relevant to undergrads.
According to UMich’s UROP website, 1400 undergrad students participate in research, mostly as research assistants without grants (i.e. the undergrad students are assistant to a team of faculty and graduate students, not original research). Through looking into their website, it seems that the ones with grants for original research are only available to select few. At NU last year, almost 563 projects already came from research grants for undergrads who wrote the grant proposal. That’s out of 900 applications. So almost 2/3 of applicants received funding. I guess you can make an educated guess which school provides more funding to undergrads on both the aggregate and per capita basis.

Posts #53 & #57 raise important concerns about the UMichigan scholarship. While seemingly assured during OP’s freshman year, it has contingencies regarding major & GPA.
@phoebehana4: I think that Ann Arbor & Evanston offer different environments. One is a mega college town while the other is a sophisticated suburb. Doesn’t make one better or worse in general–just different.
While Northwestern overall wins the prestige battle at the undergraduate level, this is not true in the area of engineering.
Since engineering is a recent switch from chemistry for OP, the Michigan scholarship has some real risks while the Northwestern scholarship does not.

61.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@IWannaHelp. I really don’t know the numbers but urop is just one way to do research. As a freshman my son applied and got two project grants and one had a research component to it. He was not in Urop. There are many ways to do this at Michigan. Urop to me is like a club. Many students just connect with a professor by email to do research,etc. Not sure how it is tracked to be honest. I am sure some apply for grants and some do not but if you want to do it it’s there for the taking.
@phoebehana4 I think there are mock 4 year plans of study on their website or call engineering and they can let you know where they are. This might just give you a clue. Also talk to the scholarship department since the academic advisor might not know the particulars of the scholarship. Just a call might do it.
Enjoy your visit. If you can do a basic general session that might be helpful. Also campus day for admitted students is going on now. Maybe you can do one of those to get the feel of the campus.

62.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Here’s a link to UMich’s COE post graduation report:   http://career.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2017/02/annualreport1516.pdf
It’s super detailed and has co-op and internship numbers and salaries as well.     Great report!
@knowsstuff is correct that you can easily pull up a 4 year plan of study for your daughter’s major.   It won’t be exact but it will give you an outline.   Here’s the link to Mech E for NU:  https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/mechanical/documents/undergraduate/suggested-course-schedule-2016.pdf

“: I think that Ann Arbor & Evanston offer different environments. One is a mega college town while the other is a sophisticated suburb. Doesn’t make one better or worse in general–just different.”
For an 18-22 yo it makes a large difference!  Also A2 is quite sophisticated that just happens to cater to its base better than Evanston.

64.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@momofsenior1. Thx, I looked but couldn’t find it. Also keep in mind that the 4 year plan will change if your bringing AP credits with you etc. At Michigan all your first year classes except like one class is on central campus and taken with the general population. So Calc or physics is taken with business, medical, engineering, lsa etc students. Not sure what NW does. Some schools engineering is by themselves for most of their classes. In your sophomore year through senior year most of your classes are on North campus. Now your with mostly engineering but with the design, theater, science kids etc. NW does something similar as well combining these creative minds.
@phoebehana4 if your Michigan scholarship is only for engineering and nothing else then that might give me pause especially if your daughter is not 100% committed to engineering. Kids change their minds through out their college experience. I know of kids getting LSA money but it is transferred if they change majors. I hope that would also be the case in your situation. I wouldn’t want my kid to feel pressured to stay in a discipline if they found their calling in another. Plus engineering is tough and usually they find out the first semester or year if it’s going to work out. My sons Calc 2 class was very sparse compared to the Calc 1 class. He had Calc 3 in high school and said neither class was easy FYI.

65.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@rjkofnovi. Both are actually great college towns but different. Evanston has more nicer restaurants that you would find on main Street and over and Ann Arbor is built with stores /shops that cater more to the students. But if you want some excellent restaurants you just go over a block or two at Michigan. Ann Arbor being larger just has more to offer. Don’t really think one is better or worse. I like the fact that at least on Central campus it just surrounds you. I just think the students have more choices which makes it more diverse. Not many kids are going out to eat $30.00 steak dinners at either schools. I love Evanston but if I lived there it would become more of the same food places to go to. Again with meal plans etc just don’t see this as a big deal.

66.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Michigan’s 4 year plan just lists all of the courses and a flow sheet. It doesn’t seem to break it out by semester like other school’s do.   IMO, not as helpful as NU’s site but you can get an idea of what’s needed to graduate.
Absolutely the 4 year plan on line doesn’t take into account any of the individual difference with AP/DE credits.    For my DD (different school), her co-op and minor changed her 4 year plan considerable.  Then there is a major concentration.
I will say that in terms of technical courses required for the major, I found little difference amongst the ABET accredited schools.    The academic differences were more in how the schools approached the first year of engineering, if AP credits could be used, and then what concentrations were offered within the major.

67.<<<sushiritto>>>
Around here in my locale, NU has a little more (not a ton more) “ooh” value or cache than Michigan, in terms of the overall academics. Folks around here are still impressed with UMich no doubt. And although UMich has a better ranking for engineering, the UMich scholarship restriction would be the deciding factor for me as a parent. Kids change their majors all the time.
I mentioned “school spirit” and sports, because they were a factor in my kid’s admissions decision. Big sports fan. My kid still gets geeked up sending me pics of well-known athletes that attend the same class or classes. And there’s nothing like ESPN Game Day coming to Ann Arbor for a big game (last year it was the Whisky game) and being out there in the audience holding up a funny sign for the cameras.
The class sizes wouldn’t worry me at all, because the class sizes (15:1 per CDS) at UMich just haven’t been that big freshman year, even the “weeder” classes. Another poster mentioned new facilities (football/athletic building), but that also wouldn’t be a determing factor, because UMich has been in the process of upgrading their campus for years, including a new student union building and academic and athletic/recreation facilities. And there’s been a building binge of new upscale apartments all around Central campus as well. In fact, my kid just rented one for sophomore year.
All in all, I’d pick NU due to the scholarship limitation and for a bit more overall academic cache.

68.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
The scholarship limitation at Michigan would be the biggest concern for me as well.

69.<<<Dolemite>>>

[quote]
The UMich scholarship is contingent upon her declaration of engineering major at the end of freshman year while NU scholarship does not have any restriction
[/quote]

This is by far the biggest concern.  Are you prepared for full pay at UMich if your child falls in love with Chemistry/Physics/Math or some other A&S program.  She might decide to become a Environmental Policy lawyer.  Do you want there to be pressure on her to remain in Engineering if her heart is elsewhere?  If her other choice was somewhere she hated then I’d be more inclined to support UMich but in this case I’d be in more favor to go to NW with the options it provides.

[/quote]

Yup, that’s really the key right there. There’s really no big deal to be an Engineering major and to add other majors and minors, but if she hates engineering and wants nothing to do with it, then that’s a huge problem.
I wonder how negotiable UMich would be with that restriction?

71.<<<CU123>>>
My guess is that its non negotiable.

72.<<<patatty>>>
My son looked at both schools for mechanical engineering, and Michigan was the clear winner for him out of the two (he ended up doing ED at Cornell but Michigan was a close second).  The one thing that really stood out to him was the huge number of student-led project teams  at Michigan. I know that NU has some teams as well, but nothing on the scale of what is offered at Michigan. Someone above mentioned NU’s co-op program - you should be aware that doing a co-op there adds another year to the undergraduate experience.

73.<<<aquapt>>>
Both schools have tremendous strengths.  But I agree that the noncontingent scholarship at Northwestern tilts the scale in that direction, especially given roughly equal costs. Ongoing freedom to choose a path as interests evolve is valuable. (I would also guess that there are fewer barriers as far as switching into most programs at NU than at UMich, although I don’t have detailed knowledge on this front and assume it’s not an unmitigated open door policy at either school.)
Another factor to consider for a female student is gender-parity in STEM.  Engineering at Northwestern is 33% female, vs. 25% at UMich. ('14-15 stats so there may have been some shift since then, but it’s a non-trivial difference). Interestingly, the trend is reversed in CS, which is 15% female at UMich and only 9% at Northwestern. http://apps.washingtonpost.com/g/page/local/women-in-engineering-and-computer-science/2089/

75.<<<Genevieve18>>>
Typically, NU does not give merit scholarships as such, but there are a few (including National Merit), and a couple of them have a GPA requirement or a “satisfactory academic progress” requirement. There are no other restrictions, generally.
https://undergradaid.northwestern.edu/types-of-aid/scholarships-grants/northwestern-scholarships.html
NU may have given a financial aid scholarship equivalent to the contingent engineering scholarship from Michigan? In either case, it would not be contingent on major.
Given that the OP’s daughter only recently decided on engineering, and has been interested in other science majors, the Michigan scholarship seems to come with a large risk. Although post #54 suggested she could just go ahead and declare for engineering and she could always change later, the terms of the scholarship quoted by OP require that the student be enrolled in engineering each year to receive the scholarship for that year.
At NU she could easily transfer from McCormick (the engineering school) to Weinberg (the arts/sciences/humanities school).  A number of the courses that engineers take first year (math, chem) would fulfill requirements for many of the science majors as well (probably also true at Michigan).
NU certainly has school spirit, both in sports and in other ways, though its sports are not as huge and campus-galvanizing as Michigan’s.  When NU was in the Big Ten West championship this year, a donor paid for 11 buses worth of students to go to Indianapolis and the demand was intense. There are many sports fans on campus and they meet and talk sports and go to games whenever they can (my son is a little bummed that he’s not getting to see many of the women’s basketball games - in the NIT championship game this Saturday! - because he has practice for his club sport in the evenings this season).  Dance Marathon has a large participation rate as do other campus activities like Greek life, clubs, club sports, theater, a capella groups, etc.
OP’s daughter hopefully will visit both schools for accepted students’ day and see how she feels about them. But if she has any doubt about staying in engineering, the question is whether OP would be all right with sending her to Michigan without that scholarship.

76.<<<TooOld4School>>>
Glad you are coming to visit Ann Arbor. It’s hard to get a real feel for the school otherwise. Try to take the Segway tour if available. Central campus is under construction now with the Union and Natural Sciences building
My son in a junior at Michigan in ChemE, and we live in Ann Arbor, so we are pretty familiar with the environment. My wife and many friends work and teach at the U.
At Michigan, some engineering majors are more than 120 credits. ChemE, for example, is 128. Engineering has very limited options for electives too - required classes in the major run 60-68 credits, plus foundation classes (bio, chem, calc, physics, etc.)  Engineers are also encouraged to study abroad for 1/2 or a full semester (you pay your normal tuition+expenses). A foreign language is not required.
There are also an amazing number of research projects, from submarines to the well known solar car team to corporate sponsored projects. My son did a full year project researching 3D printing in space, sponsored by a NASA contractor. The project was so time intensive (and continued over the summer even where he was interning) than he dropped his course load to 13 or 14 credits per semester instead of 15 or 16. For these reasons many students take 4.5 years to graduate (AP credit notwithstanding).
There are incubators and coaches and tutors and labs for students to start their own businesses should they choose. The facilities seem endless.
The Tau Beta Pi honor society is very active on campus. They do a lot of peer tutoring. The engineering school sets up a buddy system for new OOS students to help them become acclimated to the campus.
Regarding AP credit, the engineering school will not recognize the same AP credits - sometimes - toward class credit when compared to other schools within Michigan. For instance, your daughter might need a ‘5’ to receive full credit, whereas a ‘3’ might be OK elsewhere. Some non-engineering AP classes, like American History might only cound toward general elective credit or not at all.
Socially, sports are outstanding - in almost every women’s and men’s sport - and improving. You get world class music (like Chicago) but at student prices - usually &lt; $20 per ticket.
Dorms are only guaranteed for the 1st year, and apartments cost $600 (basic, 20 min from campus) to $1200 (luxury, 5 min from campus) per bedroom/mo. Most are somewhere in the middle.
The devil is in the detail with the scholarship and her other interests. There is a lot of overlap between the sciences and engineering too, and dual majors/programs. I’d check on the exact parameters of the scholarship to see how much flex she has.
Also, it’s going to take more time during her daily life to get around compared to Northwestern. Classes for 1st year will be mostly on central campus, and it’s a 15 min bus ride to North.

77.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@TooOld4School. You just scared me about the extra semester. My son’s in industrial engineering and it’s 128 but he had some credits and front loaded his schedule by taking 18 credits each semester. Now he can relax a bit but if course he won’t. He can actually take like 12 a semester and still graduate early… But at least on time.
He is also doing study abroad this summer with Michigan engineering in France then doing another 5 week internship in Israel in engineering on his own. So yes, engineering students can go abroad.
I would also look into
https://www.optimizemi.org/ and https://lsa.umich.edu/bli
My son did both in Freshman year and last summer. You want to create a business /student Organization etc. Michigan will let you do it and they got $15,000 project grants to boot with a graduate student that had a speciality in start ups. This led to his student org and conference this Sunday at Michigan. If you can dream it, Michigan can help you create it.

78.<<<TooOld4School>>>
The takeaway is that engineers need to plan ahead and working with an advisor (and meeting frequently) is really important. Many engineering students also take advantage of the 5 year undergrad/masters program which lets them double count some of their senior classes.

79.<<<phoebehana4>>>
In my original post, I mistakenly mixed up the merit-base scholarship from UMich (Engineering Scholarship of Honor) and the need-based Northwestern scholarship.  The UMich, as stated before, is contingent on her staying in CoE but otherwise is independent of family income.  The Northwestern scholarship, on the other hand, is evaluated annually although they do not expect changes if the family income stays unchanged.  I just thought that I ought to make that clear.
I have been looking up the 4-year graduation rate for both schools.  I’ve found information for the school overall but not specifically for engineering school.  Are such data available?
I share the concern over the engineering-only UMich scholarship.  On the other hand, I also feel that CoE at UMich seems to cover a lot more ground that should appeal to a wider range of students.  I’d think that a CoE with 1300+ students would offer more specialty classes than one with 400 students?
Unfortunately, all the admitted student days at UMich are filled.  We could not even get on a CoE campus tour before May 1st.  I have only myself to blame.  Daughter has been accepted into UMich on EA.  We were waiting for Northwestern RD and the financial aid award, which became available in the last weekend.
The information y’all have provided is extremely helpful.  I will bring these questions to the academic advisor at either school.

80.<<<sushiritto>>>
The UMich admitted student day isn’t the be all end all. We didn’t even tour North Campus, so there must a separate tour for that. We explored Central Campus, the UGLI, a few buildings with classrooms (Angel, MLB), the Law Quad, East Quad, and the old student union just before remodeling started. We got to see the inside of a dorm on the Hill, which was beautiful, most dorms on Central (West, East, South, etc.) and the Hill (MoJo, Couzens, etc.) are since they’ve been remodeled.
You also breakout into the various colleges and can ask questions. The slideshows were informative in a trivia-ish kinda way, a speaker to discuss financial aid and then ask questions. Honestly, you can go to each department and get this info. Oh, and you get some swag.
Call CoE and see if you can add your names to a date you like. If not, I’d just go on that day where CoE is having a sessions and just tag along. I’d mill around Central Campus and when you see a group being shown the Big M on the Diag, and the group leader telling the group the story of running naked at midnight from one statue to another to lift the curse of stepping on the Big M, just pretend you’re impressed and part of the group. And if you’re really good at pretending, you may get a free lunch. But I’d rather eat at Amers, Savas, Fred’s, etc. in AA. 

81.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
We actually skipped many schools tours after doing a few since everyone’s chemistry building looks the same. But we did meet with professors or department people. We found this more helpful. Everyone’s rah , rah, session were similar also. Might be able to find a peer student to take her around in engineering. Maybe someone from WISE. https://lsa.umich.edu/wise/… Never hurts to ask.

82.<<<sushiritto>>>
FYI, finals start April 24. The campus should be desolate, either because everyone is studying or their finals are done and moved out. One of the benefits of UMich. 4 months of summer.

84.<<<phoebehana4>>>
This is an update after we recently visited both UMich and NU.  We are very impressed by the enormity of UMich CoE.  The facilities and buildings demonstrate the huge investment by the university and their donors into CoE.  Our tour also showcased the clubs solely for CoE clubs. I’m most grateful to the individual attention we received from UMich staff.  I emailed the CoE financial aid office and academic advising to set up one-on-one meetings and they promptly accommodated us. Both staff patiently answered all our questions. The adviser took note of my daughter’s AP credits and gave her a rough 4-year study plan.  Ann Arbor is a neat place with an eclectic collection of shops.  However, the cold reality is that the scholarship UMich offers is strictly tethered to CoE.  Even though it’s a big deal (100 out of 1400 freshmen or maybe 100 out of ~500 OOS students are awarded), it still gives us pause. Plus, the awarded amount is not adjusted to yearly (~4.5%) tuition increase.  No additional funds are available for summer study abroad.
NU advising turned down my request for a personal meeting and instead directed us to the engineering school campus tour.  It was an hour-long informational session mostly on their co-op program.  We did manage to talk to a financial aid officer in person and it appeared that NU is rather generous and hands-off on awarding scholarship. They may even award additional study abroad aid for the summer quarter.  And if tuition increases in the future while our income does not change, the financial aid may adjust accordingly (but sure there is a possibility that the reverse may occur). Other than maintaining satisfactory progress, there is no string attached to the financial aid.
After reading through NU online study plan and AP credits listing, it appears that D has had at least 11.68 units under her belt (I think. I wish that NU advising would talk to us). This is nearly equivalent to one year of course work in NU (12 units per year and 48 units for four years).  In contrast, she would have had 16 credits in UMich, which is equivalent to one semester of course work (a total of 128 credits for 4 years).
D is still torn between these two programs although she is leaning towards NU mostly based on the financial aid and the fact that she could easily shorten one year (she is currently taking three more AP courses in her senior year that are not counted in yet) of study in NU.  I’ve not compared the course work between NU and UMich closely so I don’t really know why that there is this discrepancy.

85.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
Do you qualify for financial aid at Michigan?
Also. https://ipe.engin.umich.edu/finances/
I just grabbed this from engineering study abroad. There are both departmental scholarships and scholarships through financial aid. They have been very helpful with my son going to France for an engineering study abroad this summer. I would reach out to them.
Keep in mind just because you get AP credit it might not shorten your time at either school unless you were told differently. As stated above you might get electives out of the way but some programs depend on other things to accomplish in order. Also there are many electives your child still might want to take.
My son’s a semester ahead now. But won’t 100% graduate earlier. As a second year junior he does get to pay junior tuition though :neutral:
What you stated about the two schools and others compared to Michigan has been our experience. They treat you like family. They will go out of their way to help you,in just about anyway they can. It’s not just a facade. We had the same issue with NW. Couldn’t get information out of them and we are from Chicago. Michigan emailed right back. Answered our questions and met with us on campus.
My son’s experience so far has been the same. Michigan will go out of their way to make your child successful. They will just have to initiate it.

I second that AP credits may not shorten the amount of time needed to graduate.     My daughter started college as a second semester sophomore but because of course sequencing for her major, still needs 8 semesters to graduate.      What it allows is more flexibility in scheduling, the ability to easily add minors (or at NU maybe even a double major), or take one less class/term.

87.<<<slb176>>>
My S is still deciding between Michigan and NU also.  It is a very hard decision for him.  He was admitted to Medill for journalism and Michigan does not have true journalism program.  However his interest is wider than just journalism - wants a career in sports field - possibly management, analytics or jornalism.  Loves the sports scene and overall vibe of Michigan - prefers that over Northwestern.  But feels connections thru Medill for career in sports would be very strong.   Not sure how he will decide.

“It’s not just a facade. We had the same issue with NW. Couldn’t get information out of them and we are from Chicago. Michigan emailed right back. Answered our questions and met with us on campus.”
You keep saying that you don’t want to get into a shinier object discussion but most if not all your posts disparage Northwestern and laud Michigan. It’s ok of course to do that, you can’t just claim to be this bastion of objectivity.
Anyway for engineering, I’d also go with Michigan, but the scholarship requirement for UM as others have noted could be a deal breaker.  Otherwise I think UM is a pretty clear choice.
“He was admitted to Medill for journalism and Michigan does not have true journalism program.”
This is a little easier, there are probably two programs at Northwestern that are considered world-class, Kellogg is one, Medill is the other.

89.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@theloniusmonk. Thanks for pointing that out but it “was” our experience also. Yea, I guess it’s hard to be 100% objective with my son in Michigan engineering and I see first hand the great things happening there.
But in other posts between these schools I do point out that they are more similar then dissimilar. Many students wished they had the OP problems of choosing between two world class universities. Not a bad problem to have if you ask me. As stated though if the scholarship is “only” for engineering then that might give me some pause. Having two in OOS college at the same time is not a fun as it might seem for us…lol.

90.<<<StanfordGSB00>>>
@slb176 and @phoebehana4 - if $ is not a concern, Northwestern is a no brainer. I am stunned that any student / parent would struggle with this decision. The two options:
Northwestern, a top-tier private school (#10 ranked) that is significantly more selective with more resources and attention at the undergraduate level. SAT average close to 1500.
OR
UMichigan, a #28 flagship public university with 3-4x the number of students. It is less selective and less impressive. SAT average close to 1380-1400. Before the SAT was reentered a year ago, the difference between NU and Michigan was even more significant (closer to 150 point difference). The top schools (average SAT above 1450) saw their averages stay roughly flat (due to the rescaling) but schools with SAT averages less than 1400 (e.g., Michigan) saw their scores rise.
Compare the acceptance rates, test averages, rankings. 90+ out of 100 students with cross admits are choosing Northwestern over Michigan if $ is not a concern. 90%+ of UMichigan students could not get accepted to Northwestern or did not apply because they could not get in. I would easily pick Northwestern and not think twice about it. Why would anyone pay near the same price for Michigan over Northwestern? It legitimately makes no sense.

NU advising turned down my request for a personal meeting and instead directed us to the engineering school campus tour.
[/quote]

OK, I don’t understand this. Why would NU advising not meet with a prospective student? While I acknowledge I typically have a natural bias towards UMich in most cases, I did mention earlier to choose NU due to the UMich scholarship condition. And there’s also a bit more overall prestige with NU. At least out here in my neighborhood.
However, UMich advisors (general, math, pre-health), yes three of them, separately sat down with my kid for a couple hours and mapped out a plan for 4 years and also “gave” us 21 credits for AP classes, IIRC. A little more than a semester’s worth of credits.
The lack of a sitdown would give me pause, but I have to think that this is atypical of NU. Has to be.

[quote]

[/quote]

Besides UMich having a #5 ranking (NU is #20) in engineering and having at least another 40 LSA programs in the Top 10 rankings, UMich has a better overall sports program. Most men’s and women’s teams compete at the highest level, whether it’s football, basketball, hockey, lacrosse, tennis, wrestling, etc. And the OP has indicated that his/her son loves sports.
For example, ESPN is projecting that the UMich football team will be playing in the College Football Playoff next season (2019-2020). NU is NOT projected to be in the Top 20:
http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/26539077/college-football-playoff-predictor-michigan-makes-top-four
If the OP loves sports, and the thrill of 111,000 fans packed into the Big House, then maybe that’s why the struggle.

92.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
@StanfordGSB00… I am biased as anyone (since it was pointed out to me)  ) but where do your stats come from?
Like more resources… In what? I don’t see a lack of resources at Michigan for anything.
At my son’s conference on Aumented /mixed reality 2 weeks ago I got to speak with a team of engineering students that made a prototype for NASA for a space suit. NASA commissioned Michigan to come up with the idea of using mixed reality as part of the space suit experience to make their daily tasks more efficient. I got to try it on and experience what these students came up with. Very cool and it’s at NASA as we speak.
I am sure we both can compare the great things happening on both campuses. Both schools with great Alumni. I know many kids that got rejected at Michigan that are at Northwestern and vice versa. I know many accepted to both that are at Michigan and of course vice versa.

93.<<<Genevieve18>>>
@sushiritto I think two different posters asking about Mich v. NU are getting mixed up here.  The OP’s daughter is looking at engineering, likes school spirit but hasn’t specifically said anything about sports other than OP saying college football isn’t a factor yet. Another poster has a son admitted to Mich and to Medill’s journalism school at NU - he’s the one who loves sports and would like a career in it. For him, it sounded like the factors were the terrific sports at Mich vs. the connections to sports journalists from Medill. NU has some excellent sports teams, but not at Mich’s level.  But many top sports journalists are Medill alumni, so there are pros and cons.
OP, you mentioned summer aid for study abroad. NU also has an undergraduate research grant for summer, that students apply for, and large numbers receive:  http://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/summerurg (see http://undergradresearch.northwestern.edu/2018-summer-undergraduate-research-grant-winners for the long list of last year’s winners).
The quarter system at NU means that students take more classes than in a semester system, and so many students double major or double minor.  The AP credits make that very doable in four years, if that’s something OP’s daughter might consider doing.  https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/applied-math/undergraduate/dual-majors.html
For me, this would come down to whether OP’s daughter is certain that she wants to study engineering, since the Mich scholarship is tied to the CoE, and whether OP can comfortably afford Michigan if OP’s daughter changes her mind about her field of study.

94.<<<sushiritto>>>
@Genevieve18 You’re right. My apologies to everyone including the OP. My confusion. My bad.
Forget the football comment, but I’m still put-off by NU advising not making time for the OP.'s kid.
FWIW, my UMich has planned a major and two minors in 4 years. However, not in engineering.

95.<<<Genevieve18>>>
I am surprised that advising didn’t make time. Wonder if there were too many admitted students trying to meet, due to Wildcat Days.

96.<<<slb176>>>
Correct - his decision is not just based on rankings.  It will be mostly based on overall fit.  Personally, I think he will get great education at either school

97.<<<Genevieve18>>>
And no worries, @sushiritto - easy to get it mixed up as there are questions being raised about two different students.
@slb176 I agree that your son would get a great education at either! and each have different advantages for him. Makes it harder to choose, but the good thing is there’s no bad choice.

98.<<<slb176>>>
We went to Wildcat Day recently and while impressed with Medill,  he felt there was overall a feeling of stress among students and he did not feel that at Michigan.  Kids at Michigan seemed very happy.

99.<<<StanfordGSB00>>>
@slb176 - the students in a regular English Literature or U.S. History course in high school are probably A LOT happier than the students in AP English or AP U.S. History. Which course will provide the better education / future opportunities?

100.<<<slb176>>>
I disagree completely - Michigan is a very well respected School with high caliber students.  I do not agree with your comments at all

101.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Stressed out kids has zero to do with course difficulty between these two schools.  Michigan’s courses are just as rigorous.   Quarters vs Semesters,  I would buy.

102.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
Michigan lsa has a 3.88 unweighted GPA with 32/33 act. Michigan Engineering has a 3.93 with a 34 ACT avg. Think their doing OK.

103.<<<aquapt>>>
Just as a few encounters on a campus visit can (perhaps disproportionately) influence one’s impressions, the attitudes of certain individuals who take it upon themselves to represent a school on CC can give one pause as well. I know that when my daughters were making decisions, I noticed distinct differences in “vibe” on different schools’ threads, and it did make us think about what kind of people they wanted to spend four pivotal years of their lives with. Personally, I would happily trade a one-point difference in median ACT for peers with some measure of humility and a healthy sense of perspective.
Of course, wrt these schools in particular, I’m sure there are humble and grounded people to be found at both, as well as people who feel unreasonably superior because of where they go to school. I can’t begin to guess at how the proportions might vary between the two institutions. But I would venture that current students who seek to bludgeon other institutions with stat-comparisons and “no brainer” assertions of preeminence might not be marketing their cherished institutions as effectively as they imagine.

104.<<<Genevieve18>>>
Both schools are extremely strong and have large numbers of very smart and hardworking students.  Bashing one school, not based on experience but just on looking at somewhat arbitrary rankings and barely different entering stats, is unnecessary and not constructive.

105.<<<Genevieve18>>>
The prospective students’ issues are what school will be a better fit, and are both schools affordable choices.  Where they are ranked by USA Today should not be an issue at all.
None of the Northwestern students or parents that I’ve met have been fixated on prestige like this poster.  I went to law school with people like that, who felt they were superior to the rest of the world and cared only about prestige (and power), and I hated it.  It does not represent the atmosphere at Northwestern.

106.<<<theloniusmonk>>>
“For example, ESPN is projecting that the UMich football team will be playing in the College Football Playoff next season (2019-2020). NU is NOT projected to be in the Top 20:”
At the risk of going slightly off thread, those articles are all click-bait to get college football and UM fans to click on the article.  I follow college football very closely and know a lot of Michigan fans, they say beating OSU would be a good first step and then winning the division, something they haven’t done in a long time.
“Of course, wrt these schools in particular, I’m sure there are humble and grounded people to be found at both, as well as people who feel unreasonably superior because of where they go to school.”
It’s all perspective, talk to any OSU or MSU student, and they can go for days on UM arrogance (ok slight exaggeration), but you get the idea.

107.<<<phoebehana4>>>
Only 8 days to go before the decision day! We went to NU WildCat Day after my last post and I spent nights pouring over the course catalogs of NU and UMich engineering. I also made some corrections-

The “theme” requirement in NU McCormick means that D will have some useless AP credits because no more than three (out of 7) humanities/language/social sciences theme courses could be at 100 level.  She would have to take the remaining 4 at NU.  In contrast, she only needs to take one more 300 level humanity at UMich.  In addition, UMich does take her AP chemistry (as does NU). It’s roughly equal between UMich and NU in terms of how much time she’d be able to trim from 4 years.
CoE at UMich has more required departmental courses than NU.  For Mechanical engineering, Umich requires breadth in 5 major areas while NU only lists three areas.
NU’s curriculum and presentation emphasizes on the humanistic aspect of engineering training.  Again this is illustrated in their “theme” requirement and the “soft” freshman design/communication engineering core (IMHO - that’s kinda like kids’ play). In contrast, UMich CoE launches freshman right into computer programming.
NU engineering facility is dwarfed by UMich.

I asked a ME sophomore who hosted us during the tour how many of her freshman peer did not return to McCormick. She said in her advising group, 3 out of 10 transferred out to Weinberg.

I jokingly told D that if her dream is to build the most amazing rocket to reach a black hole, she probably should go to UMich. However, if she aspires to be the CEO of a teach company, she should probably go to NU.

108.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Kudos for doing a deep dive.   I think your assessments are correct.

109.<<<sushiritto>>>
How did you like the campus and the City of Evanston?

110.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
Since there is still some indecision I will tell you I have to challenge your assessment. At Michigan you can truly do both, reach the black hole and be the CEO of the company that sent it there. They set you up to do whatever you want to do and will support you in the process. I might PM some information to you to prove this point.

111.<<<osuprof>>>
@phoebehana4
A couple of things regarding your post:

The “theme” requirement in NU McCormick means that D will have some useless AP credits because no more than three (out of 7) humanities/language/social sciences theme courses could be at 100 level. She would have to take the remaining 4 at NU.


Are you sure? When I look at Mccormick AP exam credit chart, several AP classes translate as 200 level courses: Micro and Macro econ, US Gov, US and World History.

In contrast, UMich CoE launches freshman right into computer programming.


NU’s engineers do Matlab programming in their first quarter through their engineering analysis class.

NU engineering facility is dwarfed by UMich. 

The  student to faculty ratio is probably still better at NU. NU has 400-450 engineering majors per year, UMich has 1600.

112.<<<sushiritto>>>
The UMich CoE Class of 2022 is 1,363 students.

113.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
^^^^Thanks for printing accurate information!

114.<<<Knowsstuff>>>
Both schools do Matlab but there are also choices. My son did C++/Python instead as a freshman.
Also not sure why people think if Michigan is a larger school they will get no FaceTime with their professors or there are less instructors per student etc. I did a real test and asked my son. He said anytime he needs to speak to his professor and not a graduate student he pretty much… Wait for it… Walks into his office… He said it’s really as easy as that ?. Of course it becomes busier around right before tests. Also there’s this crazy thing called email. Professors so respond to it. He also said most of the graduate students are actually really good. There is also software to ask questions during class or you can do something that is very old fashioned, raise your hand. The software is just cooler.
Both schools have excellent resources with helping kids learn and have learning centers, peer to peer groups and math, science help labs and the like.

Just a recent (last Friday) example. My kid’s math professor not only answered a question quickly on a Friday night, but not 20 minutes after completing an assignment online in the math lab last Friday evening (kinda last minute, final is this Friday), kid receives a funny sarcastic congratulatory email from the professor. From the screenshots of the professor’s emails, he seems totally cool. 20 minutes after? First name basis? Big public school?
Although, outside the math lab, some student of his wrote on the whiteboard “(professor’s name) makes me sad.” 
There’s no doubt that UMich is a much bigger (and public) school and probably requires a bit more effort on the student’s part than NU. I guess my point is that, yes, UMich is big and, yes, it’s public, but the vibe isn’t “Big Public, you’re just a number to us.”

116.<<<phoebehana4>>>
@osuprof
You’re correct - micro and macro Econ do count as 200 courses at NU!  I’d hate to have D’s hard earned credits go to waste. In retrospect she could (and should) take it easy for the senior year because she has maxed out transferable AP credits.
Regarding NU freshman programming with MatLab … my understanding is that MatLab is a tool not a programming language as opposed to C++, which is what UMich freshmen have to take in the first semester (@knowsstuff).
I really appreciate all the comments here, including the sports talk and a little bit of rivalry ?.  Personally, I prefer semester system and the opportunities that come with big schools.  I feel Ann Arbor is a better place for young adults to learn to be independent.  Umich CoE is definitely a top notch school.  I also feel that UMich is much more nurturing and supportive than NU.  On the other hand, D has always leaned towards NU.  Partly because she has already had lots of friends in NU while she does not know anyone in UMich nor anyone going to UMich from her HS.  Growing up in Chicago, she is probably more comfortable in a semi-urban environment of Evanston than Ann Arbor. I also suspect that young people are more likely to equate prestige with private universities. Among her best friends, two are going to Princeton.  That may have tipped the scale towards NU for her.   After scholarship, NU tuition + RB is $2k more than UMich tuition + RB, which is $2k more than UIUC in-state.  Since NU scholarship has no string attached, the $2k difference is insignificant.

117.<<<slb176>>>
Very hard choice between the two schools!   Pros/cons to both and both are very fine schools.   My son has finally decided on Michigan over NU but it was very very hard.   He is in LSA at Michigan and would have been in Medill which obviously is top for journalism.  BUT he is not sure that he wants journalism and really wants to explore all avenues in sports field – Michigan has courses in business, school of kineseology that he can take in addition to communications, languages that interest him etc.   He also loves the sports/social scene in Ann Arbor over NU and had talked to several kids currently at NU who talked about the stress/quarter system.   I think that he felt he fits better with the vibe at Michigan but it is hared to turn down the prestige of Medill and is just going with his gut.  Michigan will also cost us less by about $12K/year (though still oos so paying a lot).   So hard to make these choices!!

118.<<<AlmostThere2018>>>
You’ve done a great job analyzing this.  It’s good that while you realize you’d choose Mich she’s not you.  Sounds like she feels a pull to Northwestern.  The thing I come back to is her scholarship.  I’ve read 30% of engineering students overall change their major and it seems like there’s already at least a seed in her mind that she might want to go different direction. . .
Northwestern offers a lot — and if she does want to build that rocket she can go to Mich for grad school!

119.<<<Alexandre>>>
phoebehana4, this is a difficult decision. Many students currently enrolled at Michigan and Northwestern have faced the same dilemma. In fact, it is quite possibly the most common “serious” decision faced by students attending either one of those two universities.
We are talking about two of the top universities in the nation. When it comes academics, flexibility, resources, opportunities, placement and prestige, they are comparable. Students can major in Engineering while pursing a liberal arts approach at both. Students can branch out and seek our an entrepreneurship program, or a business certificate or minor at both universities as well. Students will be smart and intellectually inclined at both schools. Opportunities for research, and placement into graduate school and the corporate world will be equally plentiful at Michigan and Northwestern.
Where they differ is in the unique and specific programs that they offer, their academic calendars and their respective campus vibe/culture/life. One cannot go wrong choosing either one of those two. In other words, your daughter should go with her gut.
And for the record, there are six Michigan undergraduate alumni that are currently CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, compared to two Northwestern undergraduate alumni, and both universities are absolutely stellar in the STEM fields. So your daughter can build rockets, and become CEO by attending either one of those two institutions!

Well seeing UM has 3.5 times the number of graduates, I’d say NW comes out a head on that one.

121.<<<Alexandre>>>
“Northwestern is significantly more impressive on the pedigree level / resume.”
StanfordGSB00, I am not sure who told you that, but by and large, most employers, from Fortune 500 companies to Investment Banks, and from Silicon Valley techs to Management Consulting firms do not differentiate between Michigan and Northwestern. As far as academe is concerned, Michigan and Northwestern are considered equally prestigious. Outside of the crowd that worships the US News (aka, impressionable high school children and parents), there are not many highly educated adults who would agree with your statement.
“Why would you pay the same amount of $$$$ to go to a large public school (which is still awesome but not quite the same level as NW) when you can go an elite private school with more resources, a higher caliber student body, smaller classes, etc.”
So let me get this straight, Michigan is merely a “large public school”, but Northwestern is elite? Are you for real? First of all, Northwestern does not have more resources than Michigan. You clearly need to study Michigan more before laying such claims. Students, on average, are indeed of a slightly higher caliber at Northwestern, but the students at Michigan are not far behind. Classes at Northwestern will be smaller than at Michigan, but that is mainly thanks to the thousands of freshman seminars offered at Northwestern. Remove seminars from the equation, and Michigan and Northwestern will have a similar ratio of large:mid-sized:small classes. Intro level classes at Northwestern will be smaller, but still large. Intermediate and advanced classes at both universities will be roughly the same size.
“UMichigan alums will disagree here but if money is not a factor, 90% of students are choosing NW over UMichigan.”
That is a grossly exaggerated figure. While there are many students who choose Michigan over Northwestern because of cost, there are probably just as many who choose Northwestern over Michigan for the same reason. I would say that when you cross out financial decisions, cross admits choose Northwestern over Michigan on a two third to one third basis. But it should be noted that the disparity is due to ignorance, not objective analysis of the pros and cons. High school students are impressionable and easily swayed by criteria that are, quite frankly, immaterial. Impartial students who choose to look at those two objectively will be equally split between Michigan and Northwestern.

122.<<<Alexandre>>>
“Well seeing UM has 3.5 times the number of graduates, I’d say NW comes out a head on that one.”
CU123, I clearly stated that phoebehana’s daughter can attend either university if she wishes to build rockets or become CEO. I did not give the edge to either university.
