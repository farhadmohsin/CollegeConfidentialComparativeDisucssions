hi there college confidential community!

2.<<<Prof99>>>
Ditto, congratulations! Go with feel and anticipated major.
FYI, and FWIW, in recent years (in voting with their feet) most cross-admits choose Stanford and that would be my choice as well. The top tier in the US is Harvard-Stanford, and that is not about to change. Your observation that Stanford "will gain more prestige in the coming years" is dead-on. The arc of Stanford's trajectory in US academia has been amazing since the 1950's and shows no sign of diminishing. I have never been sold on the "this school blah blah blah undergraduates, while this school blah blah blah graduates." That argument is over-hyped and specious (popular with parents and with those who are not professional academics at the very best schools). The best scholars are the most passionate about their work and that passion is shared with their students.
Again, congrats. Two great schools. Can't go wrong. Best of luck wherever you go/row,

3.<<<HMom16>>>
One thing I haven't seen mentioned yet - how did you feel about the rowing coaches and teams? Since you'll be spending so much time together, the team/coach fit can be almost as important as the academics.

4.<<<fivesages>>>
To add to the @Prof99 point about schools' focus on undergraduates...one of the finalists for the fed chairman position is Stanford's professor John Taylor...who is teaching an undergrad econ course this quarter.

5.<<<prodesse>>>
@Prof99, there are two reasons why I am encouraging my own kid to pay attention to undergraduate-oriented schools.

First, to avoid getting taught by graduate students instead of faculty. Second, in the absence of grad students, the undergraduates are the ones to get the best research opportunities.

6.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Prof99

I'd like to think that the OP is intelligent enough to appreciate some fact-based "blah blah blah blah" as opposed to your juvenile blah blah blah blah that have absolutely no basis on facts. I DON'T care whether the OP ends up going to P or S or elsewhere as it doesn't concern me a bit, but I hope folks do take some care in recommending one school over others in a responsible manner. In spite of an opposing viewpoint, I nevertheless appreciated @LoveTheBard's post, as an example, because it's based on facts for the OP to seriously consider and not some wild personal opinions.

[quote]I have no knowledge of Princeton crew but I only see one Stanford team (women 2014) on the list of Pac12 men's and women's champions in the last 30 years.[/quote]

If you were looking at NCAA championships, that's probably because men's crew is not an NCAA sport/championship where women's is. If other sports are important to the OP, then Stanford will win in almost every list. PAC 12 sports are fun to watch, fun to follow. Marching band, cheerleaders, tailgating - all going to be better at Stanford. Look at the events each crew attends. Many might be the same events, but Stanford will go to regattas at Washington, UCLA, Oregon and Princeton will be heading to Boston and NYC more often.

8.<<<prodesse>>>
Princeton. Go with the vibe.

9.<<<prodesse>>>
You have great choices. Is the bottom-line price tag (including travel) an issue?

In this case you might want to give the highest weight to the rowing particulars. Which coach did you like better? Would you be a star at one school and average at the other? What kind of academic support do they give their athletes? Were the team members full-of-themselves or welcoming? See if you can talk to some of them about positives and negatives.

Let us know what you decide!

10.<<<TiggerDad>>>
As you stated, you can't go wrong with either P or S. Ultimately, my best advise is to go with your own "gut" feelings.

When my son was making his list of schools to apply to, we had a specific strategy with which then we prioritized based on my son's desired factors. The first and foremost was the institution's overall undergraduate quality and experience. While we don't take any college rankings seriously, it's really no surprise that Princeton comes in as a perennial #1 at each new publication of the USNWR. Princeton's students-to-teacher ratio of 5:1 is the best there is. Coupled that with their Preceptorial Method, which is a modified version of the Oxford tutorial, what you have is an outstanding undergraduate learning experience.

By intention, Princeton has set their institutional focus on undergraduate more than graduate students. Their undergraduate population is only 5,232 while the graduate population is 2,747. Stanford, on the other hand, has about 2,000 more undergraduate population than Princeton and about 11,000 graduate population. Again, by institutional design, Princeton doesn't have Law, Medical and Business schools. Princeton's endowment per student is also perennially ranked #1 with $2.7M endowment per student, while Stanford is ranked #5 with $1.5M. And Princeton's alumni giving, an important signifier of undergrad student satisfaction, is also perennially at #1.

Since you mentioned it, HYP has that elite "Ivy League" prestige while Stanford has its own "Stanford prestige." While Stanford prestige might still grow and no matter how much it could possibly gain with time, it still isn't the same as the HYP's Ivy League mystique. And it's not like HYP and other Ivy League are at stand still while Stanford forges ahead leaps and bounds with prestige-building. It's not that my son and I don't like Stanford. When we made a priority list of colleges to apply to, Stanford was 4th on our list after HYP, and that was strictly based on our assessment of undergrad qualities and experiences. My son loves Princeton as the right place to get his undergrad degree while he's aiming at Stanford as one of top few grad schools to apply to. As an undergraduate-focused institution, my son would rather bet on the institution with 2,000 less undergrad students. Less chance to get lost in the shuffle.

But these remarks are my and my son's take. Everyone's needs are different. Ultimately, as I stated at the very beginning, go with your own gut feelings after exhaustively investigating on undergrad quality comparisons. Good luck with your decision making. Either way, you'll be in a great place.

11.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
^^^This. I'd add: do you have any friends at either school that you can trust to talk honestly about their experiences and not try to sell you?

12.<<<TiggerDad>>>
OP - Take a look at the profiles of the class of 2021 rowers that were recruited to Princeton: "Heavyweights Bring In Deep, Talented Class Of 2021"

<url>http://goprincetontigers.com/news/2017/10/25/heavyweight-rowing-heavyweights-bring-in-deep-talented-class-of-2021.aspx</url>

13.<<<sushiritto>>>
Congratulations on your success and hard work. Both Princeton and Stanford are beautiful campuses. And you have a tough decision.

Stanford's sports program is always #1. Stanford football is a perennial Top 10-20 team. The Stanford men's soccer team is the 2-tIme defending national champion. The Stanford women's soccer team is currently #1 in the country and a perennial College Cup (Final 4) participant. The women's volleyball team won the championship last year. Swimming, tennis, blah, blah, blah, you get the point. About 15-20% of the campus are recruited athletes at Stanford.

I do want to say that there are more than few cold (32 degrees ish) mornings here in the winter, so hopefully, Stanford will let you use the indoor ERG's instead of hitting the Bay. :))

14.<<<AboutTheSame>>>
I have no knowledge of Princeton crew but I only see one Stanford team (women 2014) on the list of Pac12 men's and women's champions in the last 30 years. I will admit my bias as a Cal alum (too many crew titles to count), but I would strongly recommend Princeton unless you think you want to be a West Coast person after graduating. Stanford has a definite focus on graduate students versus undergraduates; Princeton does not. As the father of a Dartmouth grad from California, I'd recommend a change of scenery for your college years. There's a lot to learn outside of class.

15.<<<happy1>>>
You have put yourself in the enviable position of having two absolutely amazing choices. You can't go wrong with either Princeton or Stanford. That said, the two schools do have different vibes (as you have noted) so I'd go with your gut feeling. My best advice is that once you make a decision never look back.

16.<<<TiggerDad>>>
"I'd recommend a change of scenery for your college years. There's a lot to learn outside of class."

I was brought up in CA for 18 years and spent most of those early years on sandy beaches showing off my six-pack, being pretty oblivious to historical events going on around me and culturally complacent. My first job out of grad school took me to New England, however. Now, I only like to visit CA to see my family members once in a while but there's no way I'm moving back there even for my retirement. Moving to New England was one of the best things that had happened in my life.

17.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
I can't comment on crew at either school, but how you feel about each of the school's coaches and team dynamic the should get very strong consideration.

What I can say is that the undergraduate experience at Stanford has been absolutely amazing for my D and she is 100% certain that she made the right choice in selecting S over H, Y, and P.

My D., a humanities kid through and through, is in SLE -- a living/learning program similar to Y's Directed Studies and P's HUM Sequence, but better in that it includes a very vibrant residential component: all of her SLE classes take place in the late afternoon at the dorm and discussions continue well into the night. There is resident faculty that lives on site that regularly opens his home to students and puts together events, BBQs, and field trips on what seems to be practically a daily basis. D.'s other classes are outstanding and her profs are exceedingly accessible -- not to mention utterly brilliant and tops in their respective fields.

Forget prestige -- both schools are prestigious. The bottom line is it comes down to fit: Stanford has a very west coast feel -- its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have "[appreciated] the ... 'preppy' vibe."

I would have no concerns about Stanford's undergraduate focus -- from what I've seen, the school is very invested in creating the best undergraduate experience imaginable for its students.

D's approach is the opposite of that of @TiggerDad's son: H, Y, and P will be there for grad school; she sought to select the best possible undergraduate experience in the best possible environment. For D, that was Stanford.

18.<<<fivesages>>>
Congratulations on your acceptances! Also, congrats on being part of such a wonderful sport...rowing. BTW, I am in the midst of reading "The Boys in the Boat". A friend recommended a few days ago. Both are great options...academics, prestige. Having said that, you're right on with respect to this..."Rowing, in winter, is not particularly pleasant as it's long months of indoor training which I would find at Princeton. At Stanford, we can be on the water all year round (sun!).". If you spent most of your life rowing on the west-coast, it is a big adjustment to go east-coast (weather wise). Much bigger than wanting to experience another part of the country.

19.<<<naviance>>>
You have provided lots of personal identifying information. Coaches may be seeing this...

20.<<<Sue22>>>
Any difference in financial packages?

21.<<<suzyQ7>>>
@naviance but if the OP has already been accepted, what's the risk?

22.<<<Luska19>>>
Time demand for your sport will be higher at Stanford if that matters...as well as travel I assume.

23.<<<naviance>>>
SuzyQ- a poster asked OP "which coach do you like better?" Perhaps the OP should be aware that this is an public forum and be careful what opinions, thoughts or information is shared when readers may be able to identify OP. :)

24.<<<Penn95>>>
@cllgerower1999 looking at it objectively I think Stanford has the edge here. Better athletics, better STEM/CS programs, better weather and it is an overall stronger university that provides the whole gamut of resources due to its strong grad schools.

That said, if your heart is at Princeton for any reason (change of scenery, like he team/coach better etc) you should go for it. At this level the differences are small. Plus as you said Princeton's undergrad focus is amazing.

25.<<<Dolemite>>>
I would say one thing to think about is the role of Athletics at each school. Obviously Stanford is the most successful Division I athletics in the country and there are some consequences tied to that. There are 'classes' for each Varsity sport. Will you be expected to max out the 8 credits available in ATHLETIC 28? Will your Athletic Advisor steer you to easier courses and easier majors so you can focus more on rowing? Is having access to less rigorous courses important because I believe you'll find more at Stanford than you will at Princeton. All Princeton UGs have to do research and produce a Thesis along with other papers to build up to that. Is that something that appeals to you or not?

26.<<<Penn95>>>
@strawberry2000 what is your intended major?

I think objectively Stanford has the edge. better athletics, better weather, overall stronger school with more resources available because it has top grad schools (say you wanna do research at the medical school/hospital or the business school, or take a law or business class etc). Also for practically all majors Stanford is just as good or stronger than Princeton.
Most importantly, since you gel much better with the coach and team at Stanford I dont see why you wouldn't go there.

All that said, you cannot go wrong with either choice.

27.<<<TiggerDad>>>
Since you stated that your decision comes down to "athlete life vs. school life," some questions for you to ask yourself:

Regarding athletic life:

How significant is being an athlete in your life, i.e., is it just for college, post-college, perhaps Olympics, etc.? In other words, is it a short-term or a long-term goal?

Will you be an average or top contributor at P, at S?

Have you done any research on which college supports athletes better adapt to rigorous academic environment? What are their graduation success rate like? (These are available from their respective athletic depts.)

Regarding academic life:

Do you prefer a larger school setting or a smaller LAC-like school? For comparison, Stanford has about 2,000 more undergrad students than Princeton, which has about 5,200. Stanford's grad student population is about 11,000 whereas Princeton's grad student population is about half of its undergrad population at 2,700. Stanford has Med, Law and Business schools. By institutional design, Princeton doesn't. There are pros and cons to either environment, and it's up to each individual student preference.

What do you intend to major in? Which school has greater strength in your area of academic interest? What resources does each school have for assisting you towards your career path given your major?

What pedagogical style do you prefer? Princeton has the Preceptorial Method which is a modified Oxford tutorial learning environment with 5:1 student-teacher ratio. I'm not as familiar with Stanford's pedagogical methods, so I'll leave that for other knowledgeable folks to contribute here.

Princeton has residential college (6) system, and each college where you'd be housed is staffed by 1) the college dean, 2) director of studies, 3) faculty advisers, 4) peer academic advisers and 5) director of student life, a staff member dedicated to support your health and well being. Again, I'm not familiar with Stanford counterpart to this so I'll leave this up to others to contribute here.

You can't go wrong with either of these great institutions. However, they're very different in culture and experience, so do make a wise decision based on YOUR personality and needs. One big mistake I've seen so many young students make is going with what their peers think are a greater choice when instead they need to really dig into their self-knowledge of who they're and what they want to accomplish in life. In other words, DON'T go with either the Ivy hype or the Stanford hype. Go with what'd fulfill your life in the long run.

28.<<<Dolemite>>>
What I said in the other similar thread for the Rower trying to decide:

I would say one thing to think about is the role of Athletics at each school. Obviously Stanford is the most successful Division I athletics in the country and there are some consequences tied to that. There are 'classes' for each Varsity sport. Will you be expected to max out the 8 credits available in ATHLETIC 28? Will your Athletic Advisor steer you to easier courses and easier majors so you can focus more on rowing? Is having access to less rigorous courses important because I believe you'll find more at Stanford than you will at Princeton. All Princeton UGs have to do research and produce a Thesis along with other papers to build up to that. Is that something that appeals to you or not?

I think that one thing that is always asked of an Athlete is would you be happy at the school if you were injured and could no longer participate in your sport or if the current coach left?

29.<<<sushiritto>>>
How about this? Princeton is in a beautiful little Hamlet of a town about an hour+ train ride away from the big cities of NYC and Philly. Stanford is a humongous urban campus about 30-45 minutes from San Jose and San Francisco. And for what its worth the building activity on the Peninsula near and around Palo Alto is crazy. Google's and Facebook's campuses are unbelievably large and growing larger by the minute in the towns surrounding Palo Alto (Mountain View and Menlo Park).

Yesterday, while watching the Eagles-49ers (in Philly) game, and then little bit of the Washington-Dallas (near DC) football games, it was raining hard. I went for a run in my shorts and tank and enjoyed a cup of coffee in my backyard. :D

What a wonderful decision you have in front of you. Both outstanding schools and campuses. Best of luck.

30.<<<sherpa>>>
How could you have been accepted by both this early in the cycle? Did you commit to both coaches in order to get their support? Did you submit two SCEA/REA applications? I'm confused.

In any event, my son was recruited by both and chose Princeton. There will be a lot of athletes at either school, with more at Stanford but perhaps a higher percentage of the student body at Princeton. Other than weather and your perception of your fit with the coach and team, I think the biggest difference is that, in contrast to Stanford's special academic hand holding of its athletes, Princeton tries to treat its student/athletes as students first and athletes second.

31.<<<bluewater2015>>>
Both great choices, obviously. I believe the numbers show that a high percentage of cross admits (~70 to 75% last time I looked) choose Stanford over Princeton, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily the right choice for you. Stanford certainly has a lot of advantages, especially if you're interested in a career in Silicon Valley after graduation.

A couple of points that may swing in favor of Princeton - one, as someone noted above, Princeton's campus has more of a classic college feel, in my opinion. And since you're an athlete, one other thing to consider is that there's likely to be more travel (plane rides rather than bus rides) and midweek competition at Stanford, as the conference schools (Pac 12 or MPSF, depending on sport) are much more spread out geographically for Stanford than in the Ivy League.

32.<<<sushiritto>>>
One of my co-workers went to Yale and Stanford and he would tell you that the whole "Eating Club" scene can be minefield to navigate at Princeton. Although as a rower/athlete, maybe that's not an issue.

33.<<<maroon79>>>
don't base your decision on the coach you like the best, as they have a way of taking other jobs or getting canned. Go to the school you like the most.

Both great schools. Keep in mind, despite what @sherpa would like to believe, there is no more"special academic handholding" at Stanford than at Princeton. Geez. Even Heisman hopeful Bryce Love is a serious student - premed majoring in Human Biology, doing research in one of the top stem cell labs in the world. Academics are paramount in all the sports.

37.<<<momocarly>>>
Stanford! We have a friend from TX on the football team and he is loving the athletics and the academics. He is really happy with the school. He is a premed.

38.<<<Penn95>>>
For premed it is also important to think about grade inflation. Stanford has more grade inflation than Princeton. Also in term of research opportunities that many premeds need for med school apps Stanford has more to offer.

39.<<<sbballer>>>
one misconception is that Stanford is laid back.. it's not. In fact I would argue it's more rigorous academically than the ivies in terms of jamming in a semester's worth of content into a quarter system. You have midterms every week and coupled with the demands of athletics it's a tougher combo to handle at a place like Stanford compared to Princeton.

40.<<<CrewDad>>>
@Penn95
Grad inflation is the least of worries.

D1 rowing is almost a year-around sport. Doing extensive research while competing in and traveling to regattas and practicing 5-7 days/week during the spring, winter and fall is extremely difficult, if not almost impossible.

I realize that research is important when applying to med school. However, I sometimes wonder how important when compared to GPA, MCAT, recommendation letters and reputation of undergrad institution .
I hired a crew coach who had rowed in the first boat at an Ivy. Although he had a mechanical engineering degree, a few years post graduation he decided he wanted to be a physician. During the time he coached for our program, he took bio and organic chem the local university and did research. He commented a number of times that had he been required to spend significant amounts of time doing research as an undergrad, rowing would not have been possible.

His MCAT scores were outstanding, but his research wasn't what most would have considered impressive....at all.
He wasn't accepted at the top schools he applied to. However, he was accepted at a respectable med school.


[quote]While being recruited, its important to include this in your conversation with coaches. Are there any majors you cant do while rowing? I know pre-med is just not an option for athletes at some schools. Be sure to ask those questions.[/quote]
Nate's bio is impressive.

41.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@sbballer - When I think of Stanford as being more "laid back" than Princeton, I am referring to their respective student bodies more than the schools themselves or the amount of work that students have to do at those schools. I was comparing the more quirky and irreverent student body of a place like Stanford, with a definite west cost vibe and lifestyle, and contrasting that with the more east coast, (in my opinion, somewhat more uptight) preppy vibe of a place like Princeton.

This is what I said: "Stanford has a very west coast feel -- its student body is quirky and irreverent, every bit as accomplished as those of its peer schools, but a bit more laid back, IMO. My D would not have "[appreciated] the ... 'preppy' vibe."

I cannot comment on the quarter vs. semester system and how that works with athletics, but quarters do move at a fast pace. I think that the frequent mid-terms are more of an issue for some of the STEM classes than for the humanities and social sciences, although there are no shortage of papers to write for the latter two areas of study.

@sushiritto - To my mind, Stanford is hardly what I would consider an "urban" campus. More suburban than urban, IMO. And Princeton is, indeed, a beautiful hamlet.

Yale, Columbia, NYU, Northeastern, U.Chicago are urban. Stanford is sprawling and suburban, and I'd hardly consider Palo Alto to be an urban metropolis, no matter how much building is going on there.

42.<<<TooOld4School>>>
I'd pick Stanford simply for logistics. If your family is on the west coast they will have more of a chance to see you than at Princeton, and could probably attend some of your meets too. Flights up and down the coast are very cheap and are essentially shuttle runs. You can't go wrong with either academically. You don't mention cost - is that an issue? Is there scholarship money involved at Stanford?

43.<<<sushiritto>>>
[quote]no matter how much building is going on there.[/quote]

@LoveTheBard we disagree then. I actually live here and the commercial construction activity is HUGE. Seriously. New hotels, office buildings, retail, etc., between Redwood City to Sunnyvale and beyond. Have you seen Page Mill Road in PA lately? Suburban? Nah. Urban to me, and certainly when compared to Princeton.

44.<<<CALSmom>>>
@cllgerower1999 congratulations on your wonderful choices! I have a kid at an Ivy in a different sport. From California as well and wanted a different culture. It's working out ok for him there and the deciding factor was the major, school culture, the team competitiveness and team culture. One thing to seriously consider is the weather especially given that yours is an outdoor sport. My kid would compete in 30-40 degree weather and that was in the spring. Not ideal but it is what it is. The other factor (which may or may not be important to you) is the racial mix of the student body.

You mention you had unforgettable feelings about being on princeton's campus which is great but you bring up a good point that you're a teenager and might not trust your feelings. You may have that feeling now but there's always a honeymoon period then reality sets in once practice and school starts and the grind becomes that...a grind. Your teammmates will really shape your experience during your undergrad much more than anything else.

I'd give the nod to Stanford: prestige, high quality academics, weather and PAC-12 athletics. Good luck!

P.S. Now that my kid has had some experience as an Ivy athlete coming from another coast, the drawback has been distance. The lack of family support at meets was evident and the struggle was real. I'm sure it's contributed to some positive takeaways such as character building but I have to agree with @TooOld4School

45.<<<rhandco>>>
If you are "accepted" as in an assistant coach said you're in, well, good luck.

Anyway, have to agree with what others said - Princeton attracts a certain kind of person looking for a certain education, a.k.a., not much time spent on non-academics.

Stanford freaking caters to Olympians and pro athletes. I can't imagine any true athlete picking Princeton over Stanford purely for the athletic advantage.

Having gone to an Ivy, I know that at my school (near Princeton LOL) had few West Coast kids and it was isolating as far as I could tell from a third person view.

46.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@sushiritto - it all depends on what your definition of "urban" is both in terms of residential areas and in terms of campuses.

When I think "urban," I think "inner city" and when I think "urban campus" I mean one that it within the inner city, especially if buildings are interspersed with city streets.

Ultimately, it's all a matter of perspective -- I grew up in Manhattan, and consider most "metropolitan" regions in CA (except for downtown LA or downtown SF and a few scattered other cities) to be a series of concatenated suburbs, so everything's relative.

And I agree with @TooOld4School. @CALSmom, and @rhandco -- distance and logistics matter (more to some than others). These are all considerations when it comes to finding "fit."

47.<<<sushiritto>>>
@LoveTheBard I grew up in a large city too, though admittedly not nearly the size of NYC. Times change. High rises are sprouting up everywhere here. Come visit sometime.

My comment concerned special academic tutoring exclusively for the benefit of athletes, which Stanford offers and, by conference agreement, Princeton does not. Fact, not opinion.

50.<<<Booajo>>>
As a former Ivy rower who spent hours in the tanks, Stanford sure has nicer weather! That said, a rower at Princeton is going to be considered more "elite" by fellow students than is the same rower at Stanford. That's because Stanford has amazing athletes and teams in every sport!

51.<<<sbballer>>>
I would have to agree that Stanford is located in a suburban area and not an urban one. after Stanford I always considered campuses such as Princeton as way too small. I much prefer a larger campus and it's easy to get around on bike.

I also agree that as far as rowing you're going to placed higher on the pecking order of athletes at Princeton than at Stanford. Rowing is part of the culture and esprit of an ivy school. Stanford athletics is part of the Pac12... the most competitive conference in the US but also a.completely different athletics conference and culture compared to the ivy conference.

52.<<<nordicdad>>>
People keep saying that Stanford has stronger athletics. The OP is a rower. Just looking at 2017 IRA champs, Princeton men crushed Stanford. Of the 3 V8 boats Princeton was in the grand final with each boat, and Stanford was in the third final with each boat. That is not to say you should go to Princeton. The competition to get a seat will likely be much tougher at Princeton. There is still much more rowing depth in the east than the west.

53.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford has the strongest athletic dept in the country... Stanford has won more NCAA individual and team championships than any other Div 1 university.. along with winning the directors cup for 24 straight years.

on the women's side it looks like the names I see coming up are Washington, Berkeley, Ohio State, Virginia, Brown, Stanford.

I am frankly surprised at the strength of Ohio State and the Pac 12... would have expected more ivies.

<url>http://www.ncaa.com/history/rowing/d1</url>

apparently men's is not part of the ncaas..so don't have the results for that but on the women's side I see more rowing depth in the midwest and west coast than the east coast.

54.<<<sbballer>>>
and actually the pac 12 has dominated men's rowing since 2006 with either Washington or Berkeley winning the IRA championship..although Yale did break the streak this year.

PAC 12 is surprisingly the conference to beat in rowing..not the ivies.

55.<<<sushiritto>>>
Well, it is the "Conference of Champions." :)

56.<<<nordicdad>>>
You will notice that Stanford is not UW or UCB which are indeed very strong mens crews and have been for around 90 years. That is why I said there is more depth in the east not that the best mens crews are in the east. Stanford is strong, just not as strong as most of the Ivy.

57.<<<Dolemite>>>
@riley2 I have to agree with @sherpa concerning the hand-holding. Stanford has each varsity sport as an actual class the team members take for credit in which they just do their sport. They were also dinged by the NCAA for passing around a list of easy classes for athletes to take. You aren't going to find that at Princeton. Of course that might be appealing to the original poster due to the requirements of rowing.

58.<<<sbballer>>>
but it's clear that the PAC 12 is the stronger conference for rowing.. both women's and men's which I am sure comes as a surprise to many of the posters at CC who tend to be predominately of the ivy persuasion.

59.<<<sbballer>>>
oh btw... the Harvard football team also passed around a list of easy classes to take... they had a name for it which eludes me now so I wouldn't be so sure about that.

60.<<<Dolemite>>>
@sbballer Harvard and Princeton aren't the same school. Every school has easier courses available - there aren't any athletes taking the Integrated Science Curriculum with my D but there are in her Psych 101 class - but maybe due to size and less grade inflation fewer at Princeton. Also there's no ducking that Senior Thesis requirement. Basically the rigor floor is lower at Stanford which isn't necessarily a bad thing. That's not a statement about the rigor ceiling which obviously at school like Stanford is as high as the student desires.

Mining for Gems.

Additionally, it's not only football players at Harvard that look to balance out the workload with an easier class here and there. And I would argue that there are few colleges that don't have a similar list.

62.<<<Penn95>>>
@Dolemite you are describing some aspects where Princeton is more rigorous. However, the quarter system at Stanford is indeed very intense and can prove quite rigorous and demanding for most people. So we can't really say that one school is more rigorous than the other.

63.<<<Dolemite>>>
@Penn95 I disagree when talking about a rigor floor. You can go to a large State school and find plenty of rigorous courses but you can also 'slide' much easier. Stanford's not going to have that low of a floor but it's floor is going to be lower than schools like MIT, Chicago, Cal Tech and even Princeton. Most likely doesn't matter much for this applicant.

64.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@dolemite -- You've got to compare apples to apples in trying to ascertain rigor -- STEM vs. Social Science/Humanities, number of units/contact hours, laboratory vs. seminar, etc., what the actual course requirements (amount of reading, number of papers, tests, PSETs, etc.) are, as well as the relative strengths and interests of the students taking the classes. It's probably easier for some kids to do a ton of PSETs and bang out a bunch of lab reports than it is for them to write a 15-page research paper and vice versa. Then there's the issue of graduation/gen ed requirements and how those can be met, whether or not there is a core curriculum, etc.

Also, bear in mind that there are theses and there are theses. One of the things my D looked at in comparing two schools within a consortium were the quality of the senior theses of each of the schools (they were available online through the library). Overall, there was a significant difference in the length and quality of the work from the students at one school versus the other. She also noted differences in the levels of intellectual curiosity among the student bodies that she perceived inside and outside of the classroom among the many schools she visited.

Overall, you are probably correct about rigor floors and ceilings...the college experience (and life) is often what you make of it; it can be as banal or as rich as the person living it.

65.<<<Dolemite>>>
@LoveTheBard My main point is that all schools lower their admission standards for Athletes. The Ivies came to an agreement about how much they would lower their standards for Athletes. Other elite privates that participate at the Division I level like Stanford, Duke, Notre Dame, Vanderbilt, etc only operate under their own standards and the NCAA's. While Stanford does an admirable job keeping standards high they nonetheless make extensive exceptions for Athletes to be able to participate in their sport at the highest level and still maintain satisfactory academic progress toward a degree. The by product is the ability to find less rigorous courses and majors.

66.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
I daresay that at all of the schools that have been mentioned (HYPS, MIT, Chicago, Cal Tech, etc). will all have no shortage of kids working at very high levels as well as their fair share of (relative) slackers...I contend that there are more and less rigorous courses and majors at every school. I was a notorious underachiever that attended one of NYC's specialized high schools that consistently ranks as being one of the top 10 math-and science schools in the country, managed to graduate magna cum laude from Georgetown University and be admitted to Phi Beta Kappa without producing a body of work that -- at this point in my life -- I would consider to be representative of those levels of achievement. My D (who thankfully takes after her father and works at a much higher rigor ceiling than I ever did) has produced far better work than I had ever done as an undergraduate and perhaps even as a graduate school student. I suspect that she would probably work at that level at any school. To quote the Danish prince "[she] could be bounded in a nutshell and count [herself] a king [queen?] of infinite space." Me? Not so much....

67.<<<CALSmom>>>
I think the back and forth discussion on which school/conference is more rigorous is not helping OP and the criteria is probably a wash for him. However, I agree with @Penn95 that the quarter system and the pace of it does add to stress level (at least). You have to remember that the OP will be juggling workouts and practices on top of classes. I hope he comes back to the thread to let us know his choice

68.<<<CALSmom>>>
FWIW, regarding post #56, my sons varsity sport practices count as 1 credit at his Ivy school. I dont see that as a problem as this is done at the high school level with many varsity sports. He practices pretty much year round five days a week. The fall is a bit lighter in intensity than in winter and onward. Many of his teammates including him are stem majors. As for taking some easy classes, I dont think thats limited to athletes. I remember choosing some classes based on easy status because I worked part time and had other non academic commitments. My point is that OP should choose his major based on what he loves and would want to pursue as a career, not what will accommodate his sport or be easy to get a degree in because his sport keeps him too busy.

69.<<<lizzzar>>>
Stanford is so selective and popular at the moment that I would choose Stanford. Lovely weather for rowing. Also, I don't much like orange. But it does sound like you will do OK whatever. I don't quite understand the preppy appeal of Princeton. Maybe it's part of an F Scott Fitzgerald type myth, but actually he struggled academically and didn't graduate. Although, obviously, things have moved on, and hopefully there is now some learning support.

Stanford's Science, Technology and Society (STS) is an "easy" major that is very popular with athletes.

71.<<<Dolemite>>>
@CALSmom Like I said in #56 getting academic credit for participating in your sport might be desirable.

72.<<<CALSmom>>>
^^gotcha @Dolemite. Just adding that its done at an Ivy school as well. I thought your post made it seem that only Stanford does that (give credit for their sport). I wont comment on the passing around a list of easy classes because Im not aware of that at my kids school.

Post#56...Stanford has each varsity sport as an actual class the team members take for credit in which they just do their sport. They were also dinged by the NCAA for passing around a list of easy classes for athletes to take. You aren't going to find that at Princeton.

73.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford is academically more rigorous than Princeton for the simple fact that you're jamming a semester's worth of content into a quarter and having midterms every week (and getting credit isn't going to compensate for that in the least) Semester system is cush in comparison.

and I don't necessarily think that's a good thing when you're an athlete with the demands of practice times in addition to everything else.

74.<<<Dolemite>>>
@sbballer I understand the rigors of a Quarter system and Stanford doesn't pack a semester's worth of material in 1 Quarter. Looking at the Math sequence clearly shows that. The Single Variable Calc sequence is 3 courses as well as the MV/LA sequence whereas at Semester schools they are 2 Semester courses. The Quarter system does give you the opportunity to take more classes you just don't go into as much depth in any single course as you would with a Semester class. Also if you're taking a requirement you don't like at least it's only for 10 weeks.

I'm not arguing that Princeton is overall more rigorous than Stanford just that Stanford has a lower floor and that for the student seeking that they can find it easier at Stanford than at Princeton.

75.<<<CA94309>>>

Wrong. If this were true, then UCLA or UCSD would be more rigorous than MIT and Berkeley! Stanford doesn't cram semester long 15 week courses into 10 week stress filled classes. Typical 3 or 2 class sequence such as intro math (51/52/53) is equivalent to a two semester sequence at Berkeley or MIT. For non sequence classes, the material covered at Stanford is much less than the equivalent one at MIT/Berkeley.

76.<<<fivesages>>>
Academically rigorous doesn't have to be just covering more or less material. It could also mean the pace/demands. For example, Stanford has shorter time periods between exams/mid-terms.

77.<<<sbballer>>>
quarter system in general is more rigorous.. over a semester system.... no contest and it's not even close. midterms every week. on a semester system you can coast till winter break and study for the finals... not true of the quarter system.

and I agree Berkeley is more rigorous.. and I would argue definitely more rigorous than Princeton..and I would include Stanford too.. esp in STEM where classes are graded on a strict bell curve. remember those:)

78.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford has a higher floor for the athlete overall than an ivy... and is more selective in admitting students at the very top of their sport. Many students may have the academics to get into Stanford as a student but not the athletic excellence to be admitted as an athlete.

79.<<<Dolemite>>>
@sbballer Historically Stanford has higher grade inflation which isn't necessarily aligned with rigor but it does mean you'll get higher grades with the same amount of work. Princeton no longer officially has grade deflation but not all longtime Profs change so easily. And you don't have a mid-term every week in a quarter system but as noted you don't have as much time to catch up if you fall behind so you have to be more diligent. I'm not placing a value judgement on grade inflation or rigor - different students want different things but it helps to have as much information as possible to make a decision. All I'm saying is that Stanford has more rigor options than Princeton with the huge Athletic program being one of the main reasons.

80.<<<CADREAMIN>>>
Congratulations on two great choices. One of the best parts of being a great athlete is having these choices (and decision) early. You are able to relax (while keeping up your training and studies) while everyone else is sweating the college apps and decisions. It's pretty sweet. It sounds like the only issue with Stanford is being bored with it being familiar. It is fantastic to be on a winning sports program if you are investing all the time to be part of one. You said Stanford is at the top of the heap. Don't underestimate how fast training indoors for a west coast athlete can get old. Being part of a huge (not just big) budget athletic program has perks mere mortals never see.....higher level of travel comfort, competitive and training opportunities - some in other countries, academic support (a tutor) on the plane with you, as much gear as you can imagine, the best trainers brought in from all over the world, custom footwear - crazy stuff, but things that help you excel as an athlete and student.

You are going to spend a lot of hours with this team and coach (coaches can change, but you likely have general idea of longevity if coach is a fixture there, but certainly the team), do you have a feeling of a fit with the guys/team culture at one or the other? From everything you have said, Stanford has more to offer you except a different coast and new experience. But it could be a new experience that is life changing for the better, or frankly it could be a bust. It is up to you to make either choice the experience you want it to be. It is ok to turn down Stanford, there are plenty of athletes that choose other schools for various reasons that are important to them. It is your life. Just be sure you are doing so based on significant reasons that are important to you. If your gut is not clearly ringing a loud bell then write down what is really important or matters in your choice - academics, athletic prestige, academic prestige, importance of winning, importance of winning level (NCAA Champion potential), coaches, team mates, location, family support nearby, big budget program, weather, size of school, support of athletes - anything at all that matters. Then prioritize them for you. Put the winner in one column and see which school has the most "victories." Sometimes it is good to separate out factors that are all jumbled in your head and causing confusion. It can help you see what is important to you.

And as a last thought, I always suggest students ask themselves this question.....10 years from now, where do you want to say you graduated from?

I assume you have until the November 8th-15th NLI period, which means someone has to be readying the paperwork now/very soon, so perhaps you have made your decision? Best to you!

81.<<<sherpa>>>
@Dolemite - How could your daughter know how many athletes are in her classes? My son took the full ISC sequence, and its likely that few of his classmates knew he was an athlete, as he doesnt have a thick neck or have an A tattooed to his forehead.

Athletes are often obvious as they miss classes for games. I have never seen my daughter's boyfriend NOT wearing team t-shirts or sweats or other gear.

Oh just women's rowing/crew is NCAA sanctioned, not the men, interesting. Didn't know there were so many more women rowing than men either. Apparently men still follow a lot of the NCAA rules in recruiting even when in IRA.

[quote]Stanford's Science, Technology and Society (STS) is an "easy" major that is very popular with athletes.[/quote]
STS is among the top 5 most popular majors for both athletes and non-athletes. However, it is more common with athletes. That said, rowers tends to have different majors. For example, the article at <url>https://me.stanford.edu/news/engineering-rowing-team</url> talks about how most rowers are engineering majors (at the time of the article).

This is true in general, but the OP is a male rower. I walked on to the men's rowing team at Stanford without any previous experience. It's one of the only non-club sports at Stanford where such walk-ons are common. And as such, while Stanford men's rowing is an excellent team, I think Princeton's men's team typically has more success in national events.

88.<<<Data10>>>
[quote]Stanford has each varsity sport as an actual class the team members take for credit in which they just do their sport.[/quote]
You can take many ~1 credit PE-type athletic classes at Stanford and I expect the other discussed colleges. For example, I took weight training and karate for 1 quarter. Both were 1 credit P/F type classes that required ~2 hours of practice per week. I don't see why spending 20+ hours per week of athletic practice in a sport shouldn't give you at least as much credit as a PE class. However, rowing is only a ~1 credit class like PE classes, and most rowers were not eligible at the time I was on the team. The ~1 credit is little in comparison to the 180 credits required to graduate, and does not at all reflect the many hours of practice and commitment that is required to be on the team. In my opinion, it's far more challenging to be a successful student as an athlete than non-athlete.

[quote]I understand the rigors of a Quarter system and Stanford doesn't pack a semester's worth of material in 1 Quarter. Looking at the Math sequence clearly shows that. The Single Variable Calc sequence is 3 courses as well as the MV/LA sequence whereas at Semester schools they are 2 Semester courses.[/quote]
You are using the slowest version of the lowest possible math sequence as an example. Most feshmen did single variable calculus in HS and take more advanced math sequences that go at a faster pace. A partial summary of freshmen math options is below. Note that there a variety of different options for students with different math background/ability/interests, as well as students who are looking to cover the material more rigorously, rather than offering a single level for all students. I also wouldn't assume athletes generally choose the lowest level for everything. I'd expect you are more likely to find premeds in the lowest versions of courses than athletes.

Math 19-21 -- 3 quarter version of single variable calculus
Math 41-42 -- 2 quarter version of single variable calculus
Math 51-53 -- differential and integral calculus in several variables, linear algebra, and ordinary differential equations
Math 61-63M -- covers the material of the Math 50 series at a much more advanced level with an emphasis on rigorous proofs and conceptual arguments
Math 61-63DM -- covers the same linear algebra material as the Math 60CM series and otherwise focuses on topics in discrete mathematics, algebra, and probability theory at an advanced level with an emphasis on rigorous proofs

I've taken classes at a lot of colleges with semester systems including RPI, SUNY, UCSD and UWy. I found Stanford courses typically to go at a much faster pace, although there was a significant variation from class to class.

90.<<<Dolemite>>>
@sherpa There are 19 students left in ISC and they pretty much all know each other now. They are all in a groupme together, they study together and they do labs together (can't have the same partner but once). It's possible someone is keeping it to themselves as no one has talked about it but she doesn't believe anyone is.

91.<<<Dolemite>>>
@Data10 The point of my Math example is that a quarter system class is not a semester amount of material packed into a quarter. The basic level of subjects that are normally taught over 2 semesters will be taught over 3 quarters at schools with a quarter system. Of course Stanford has different levels of Math just like Princeton, Yale, and probably all major universities.

Regarding the various ATH classes Stanford offers, I am just bringing up their existence and the fact that Princeton doesn't have that and it's something an Athlete with the OPs choice can take into consideration.

92.<<<CALSmom>>>
One plus for Princeton is the academic free period during which no classes are held, giving student athletes time to practice from 430pm-7:30pm. I believe P still does this.

Another possible upside to P is being in the Ivy League and a more compact region, travel won't be as much of a grueling schedule compared to the spread out Pac-12.

S&amp;P are the best of the best and pretty much a tie for academics and prestige/reputation. But I still say bottom line, the OP has to determine which athletic program/coaching/teammates/facilities he likes better as this will consume most of his time.

93.<<<Data10>>>
[quote]The point of my Math example is that a quarter system class is not a semester amount of material packed into a quarter.[/quote]
As mentioned in my earlier post, you can either take single variable calculus in 2 quarters or 3 quarters, depending on which math sequence you choose. It only shows that you have a choice of whether to pack what some other colleges do in a semester or not. The 3 course sequence you mentioned includes 3-unit courses, so they are expected to cover less material than typical Stanford/Princeton math classes and contribute less than typical Stanford/Princeton classes towards graduation requirements. Of course most Stanford students already took single variable calculus in HS. The more typical higher level math sequences also seem to list more material in their description for Stanford's 3 quarters than Princeton's 2 semesters. For example Stanford's quarter length math 51-53 covers multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. Princeton's math 201-202 covers multivariable calculus and linear algebra, but not explicitly differential equations. However, they also may have the equivalent of more units to reflect the increased material. It's not as simple as either 3 quarters of material at Stanford = 2 semesters of material elsewhere or quarter != semester. It depends on the class, number of units, and often falls somewhere in between those two extremes..

If you want to have a general rule, it's been my experience that 3 quarters at Stanford generally covers more material than 2 semesters elsewhere. Quarter length classes did appear to be equivalent to semester length in some cases, but not all. However, I haven't taken classes at Princeton or colleges at that academic level, besides Stanford..

94.<<<prezbucky>>>
Princeton is more undergrad-focused, which you mentioned. That is directly or indirectly (or both...) responsible for them being ranked #1 for undergrad by USNews. Grads show the love by donating.

Stanford is better known (and ranked) internationally due to its grad/PhD-level greatness, but you aren't getting your MBA (P'ton doesn't have a B school...), JD or PhD -- you're getting your BA or BS. For that, no university is better than Princeton.

If you were interested in Engineering or CS, Stanford has the edge. But Princeton is solid in those things and great at about everything else, and where curriculum is even, Princeton has the edge given the close interaction with your profs. Princeton's reputational bread is buttered by its undergrads and undergraduate emphasis, and that drives the budgeting and decision-making of the school. The undergrads are #1 there -- they have to be, since they comprise nearly 70% of the total student population. Motivation and capacity (largest per-student endowment) equal performance.

Regardless of your choice, you'll be at a great school.

95.<<<Data10>>>
[quote]I am leaning towards the STEM route, specifically health studies[/quote]
Health studies may be a significant difference between S and P. I believe the closest field at Stanford is Human Biology, which was Stanford's most popular major until the recent CS boom. It's an interdisciplinary field that lets you design a customized program based on your interests and goals, choosing courses from a good variety of other fields, outside of human biology classes. Stanford is big on such interdisciplinary programs like this, coterm degrees that combine BS+MS, etc. I'm not as familiar with the options at Princeton, but I do see that they offer the option to supplement major with Global Health and Health Policy and obtain a related certification, which Stanford does not have an equivalent..
[quote]Weather would typically not be a factor for me at all, except for the fact I am a recruited athlete and would have to train year round. Rowing, in winter, is not particularly pleasant as it's long months of indoor training which I would find at Princeton. At Stanford, we can be on the water all year round (sun!). That being said I grew up on the West Coast and wouldn't mind a change of scenery.[/quote]
I've lived on both the east and west coast, and have rowed at Stanford. I found the rowing at Stanford to be rough on mornings when it was cold and/or raining. I imagine this would be quite a bit worse at Princeton with more extreme temps and triple the rain, but that may be just me. I think I am more sensitive to weather than most, or maybe I've become spoiled by living in CA for so long.

This brings up another relevant point. I grew up in upstate NY. I currently live in CA, largely because of the large CA presence at Stanford job fairs, and because I enjoyed the CA area while at Stanford. If you want to live/work/internship in the SV or CA area, Stanford has a strong edge. Similarly, I'm sure the Princeton area has a strong college presence and a large number of area companies with special network/internship areas. If you'd like to live/work/internship in the Princeton area or are interested in IB/wall street, Princeton would have a big edge.

96.<<<kalons>>>
before I read the responses to this post, I knew most of them would be telling you to choose stanford, and I tend to agree. stanfords athletics are some of the best (arguably, THE best, in my opinion) in the country, and theres an underlying emphasis (though a little subtle) to pursue a major in the STEM field since its close proximity to silicon valley. like others have said, princeton is more undergraduate focused whereas stanford is more graduate focused. princeton also holds the ivy prestige vs stanford who is in a league of its own. all of that being said, I, personally, think stanford is the clear choice for you. (though, I understand the want for a change in environment! thats why Im wanting to leave the south and go somewhere in the northeast or west, haha.) you, truly, cant go wrong with either choice. congratulations, and good luck!

There is a definite cultural difference between east and west coasts. I work at a hospital where a new neurosurgeon started not too long ago. Undoubtedly a brilliant man (and I do not make the mistake of thinking all neurosurgeons are brilliant :-) ), but he talks like a Californian: as if everything is fine and nothing really matters! People are finding this disconcerting. However, I assume he is smart enough to adapt... Best of luck with your choice, OP! Really, how can you go wrong?

98.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@twinsmama - Who's to say that approaching life as if everything sucks and one has to carry the weight of the world on one's shoulders is the smarter choice ;) ? If this neurosurgeon is indeed as brilliant as you say, perhaps he'll make the smarter choice and move back to the west (or, as I prefer to say, the best) coast B-)
