I've been accepted SCEA at Yale and have received a full ride at my state school, Rutgers. I didn't end up applying anywhere else for RD so these are pretty much my options. I was just wondering if the "prestige factor" at Yale is worth it. My financial aid at Yale isn't the greatest; it's not the worst either, but I would have to take out other loans and graduate with a few thousand dollars of debt. fwiw, I'm THINKING of majoring in a STEM field (maybe med school) but am not particularly certain, and I'm privy to changing my mind. Here's what I've considered:

2.<<<runnerxc>>>
I say go to Rutgers on a full ride. If you want to go to medical school, you want to save as much money as you can. Furthermore, you'll have guaranteed research opportunities and it will be easier to make excellent grades (both important for med school)

If you don't want to go to med school, you will always find your niche. Rutgers is a huge school. You'll find intellectual people with the same interests and passions. And graduating with a high GPA in the Rutgers Honors program should not have you at a huge disadvantage relative to Yale graduates

3.<<<gibby>>>
Take the full ride at Rutgers! Medical school is very costly, and truthfully, the prestige factor of Yale (or HP, for that matter) is not worth the cost if you and your family have to take out loans. Save the money for med school and go to Rutgers -- it's a great school!

4.<<<HImom>>>
Agree that taking the full ride at Rutgers is a GREAT opportunity, so you can explore and figure out where your interests lie, including research with great profs via the honors program. IF you decide you want to go to grad/med school, it's very important to graduate with no debt so you can not be crushed by debt and have that restrict your choices of grad school and profession.

Congrats on having these great options! Debt gets old really fast and you don't want to be paying off loans while you're trying to figure out if you can afford med school. Really, give yourself freedom by allowing yourself to get a paid for great education!

5.<<<dowzerw>>>
If you were not talking Yale (or Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, CIT), I would fully vote for Rutgers free ride. But there is a long term value to a connection to a Yale (or HPS) that goes far beyond getting in to medical school. You will make connections that are invaluable and you will have a diploma to hang on the wall of your office that gives patients or clients or whatever business you end up in be both impressed and comforted. Rutgers is an excellent school, but Yale will bring more benefits long beyond the stage of getting in to medical school.

6.<<<tiger15>>>
I would go to Yale. I feel like I would rather have to deal with working off the debt than having to go through life wondering, "what if?"

7.<<<sally305>>>
^"What if" what? Sounds like the OP will have tremendous opportunities being in the honors program at Rutgers. If doing undergraduate research is more likely, and he/she is leaning toward a STEM major, the choice seems pretty clear.

8.<<<supercools>>>
Just to clarify: I don't think I'll accrue any more than $20K in debt, if that means anything.

9.<<<ealdi94>>>
To me, Yale is worth $20,000. I think the name, the degree, and the overall experience and memories that you'll get from the four years will be invaluable. Oh, how I wish I was in your position right now.

10.<<<mcat2>>>
[quote]I don't think I'll accrue any more than $20K in debt,[/quote]
The debt for the majority of med school students could be close to 8-10 times that.

11.<<<happyfit>>>
I won't even think about it. Most people wont think twice to go into 20k+ debt for a car! 20k is not going to make a meaningful difference on the amount of debt you are going incur for med school. And 20k debt is not going to cripple you if you dont go med school. Go Yale.

12.<<<photodad>>>
I'd vote for Yale also. It will be worth it in the long run. I also believe that Yale is great in most STEM fields and has plenty of undergraduate research opportunities.

13.<<<Philovitist>>>
There's barely anything in the OP about med school. >.>

You don't know what you want to do in life, so Yale seems like the best bet. Let's be honest. Which school will open the most doors, allow you the greatest flexibility, and provide you a stronger education?

It's Yale.

And by the format of your post, I bet you like that school more.

14.<<<alohamom>>>
D2 had the same "dilemma" a few years back. She was accepted to Yale SCEA and was also the recipient of the full-ride Moorehead-Cain scholarship at UNC Chapel Hill. She followed her heart and, with our blessings, chose Yale. Though I can never know what she would have accomplished at UNC, I know that she exceeded even her dreams at Yale. She was an Economics major and had perhaps the most amazing four years of her life. She made life-long friends, had her choice of great internships, and is now employed in a field she loves and in which she has a very promising future. Would things have been the same if she had gone to UNC? Quite possibly, but for us, the money we spent on Yale was well worth it.

This is important: don't push yourself or your parents beyond your/their financial parameters; no school is worth crushing debt that you cannot repay. Only you know what that is. All points of view should be considered. And good luck! You have a wonderful "problem."

15.<<<myboby123>>>
i agree with aholamom, for a business major, Yale, hands down.

16.<<<T26E4>>>
I was in your similar situation. My parents gave me the blessing to turn down the buckets o' money and accept Yale which included $ out of pocket. $20K is not a lot for some people. It's a lot for others. You can plan on working a term-time job (which actually focuses your schedule and frankly, earns a lot of money) and that $20K can be diminished.

Frankly, speak to Yale Fin Aid and ask for a final review -- telling them frankly your other opportunity (be prepared to show them Rutgers award documents). They may be inclined to give out a little more. Good luck to you.

17.<<<rebel11>>>
Come on. Stop it. What does a few thousand dollars of debt mean??

18.<<<T26E4>>>
^^ Rebel: be serious. Maybe you're fortunate enough where a "few thousand" is a casual phrase. For some families, it's an entire year's of meager income.

19.<<<rebel11>>>
^ Have you looked up the definition of few?? An entire years income?? Really??How are we supposed to give advice when the OP says a few thousand?? Don't you ever get tired of **** posts? If not **** than the phoney drama posts? If we assume the OP isn't **** than it would be stupid to pick Rutgers over Yale because of a few thousand dollars.

20.<<<T26E4>>>
whoa reb. My comment was towards the $20K that the OP said would be his/her debt if Rutgers were to be turned down.

You think there aren't families in the US who aren't living on $20K or less a year?

21.<<<bookmobile>>>
My son was also offered a full-ride at Rutgers, but had numerous reasons specific to his personal situation why Yale was a better choice. So I understand your dilemma very well. He will not be incurring the debt you anticipate, which made his choice much easier.

It sounds like you are very undecided about what you want to study. If you are at all inclined towards med school, that $20,000 (which is more than a "few thousand" in my book), will only be the tip of the iceberg in terms of your higher education debt. This is something to seriously consider. I will also mention that several of my son's pre-med-leaning friends at Yale have found the STEM classes populated by other aspiring pre-meds quite brutal in terms of difficulty.

There are some very brilliant kids at Rutgers, including several of our high-school's valedictorians and salutatorians. They have had great success in the Rutgers honors program. I know of one Presidential Scholar who, having done undergrad research at Rutgers, is now doing (fully funded) graduate work at an Ivy. (He had offers from several.) Free education the whole way for this young man.

The campuses and general vibe at the two schools are obviously very, very different. But at either school, your experience will be what you make of it. Yes, Yale has amazing resources and opportunities -- but you have to seek them out and there are many other ambitious students doing the same thing. Depending on which program you enter at Rutgers, the opportunities for students in the honors program may be easier to come by early on.

As an NJ student, you probably know some kids in Rutgers Honors already. I would really encourage you to reach out to a couple of Presidential Scholars if you can, and hear what they have to say about their experiences.

I know: People hear that you got accepted to Yale and assume "Of course you're going there!" It is hard to them to believe that you might not. Just remember that THEY are not going to be paying your tuition. Many, many smart kids these days are turning down big-name privates for full-ride publics. Yes, Yale is a wonderful place, but consider the pros and cons carefully, and do not dismiss the incurring of debt as something incidental.

Good luck to you.

22.<<<Hunt>>>
You'd be getting a Yale education for the price of a low-end Subaru Impreza. That's a pretty good deal, in my book.

23.<<<rebel11>>>
Sorry T2, I'd still pick Yale if the total debt is 20k.Rutgers is a very good school, but Yale can open alot of doors that could earn that back many times over.

24.<<<cptofthehouse>>>
I would go for Yale.

25.<<<Philovitist>>>
[quote]whoa reb. My comment was towards the $20K that the OP said would be his/her debt if Rutgers were to be turned down.

To be fair, for the exact reason that Yale is asking of the OP (at least) 20k per year, we can be sure that he/she is at least firmly middle class, if not upper-mid or upper.

So whether families exist living on 20k per year or not is kinda moot.

26.<<<rebel11>>>
It just dawned on me that no low income family has any debt once accepted to Yale or any of the other top need blind schools.. In approx numbers any family earning less than 80K pays almost nothing, and incurs no debt..

27.<<<prefect>>>
If the debt level is 20,000, I would choose Yale. It seems like you prefer Yale to Rutgers, and 20K will not be a crushing level of debt.

28.<<<T26E4>>>
Knowing Yale's Finaid formula: I'm confident that the OP's family makes more than $20K per year. And in my own life, incurring $20K total for Yale is not oppressive and would welcome it if that was the sole cost to my kid for attending Yale. I'm not suggesting it is or isn't oppressive for the OP. Like others of you have said, it's a component of the decision (which the OP himself brought forward).

What I AM saying is that $20K -- even over four years -- is not some throwaway amount of money for many people. That's ALL I'm saying.

29.<<<Bay>>>
I'd pick Yale, but I am not a debt-averse person. Don't forget you may be able to get a high-paying summer job to help pay down the debt right away. One of my Ds got a great summer placement with a major corporation through her career office and earned about $10K in one summer. (But she did have to use part of it to pay her summer living expenses).

30.<<<keesh17>>>
I know this is going to sound shallow but U.S News rankks Yale #3 and Rutgers #68.

Of much more importance, I think Yale is very well suited to a student who hasn't fully decided what career to pursue. Given that Rutgers is a large State Uni. it will probably be harder to explore possibilities - our state flagship (UIUC) is almost polar opposite to Yale in that regard.

31.<<<rebel11>>>
Yale fin. aid pkg says No family contribution if earnings are 65k or less. That's 0 EFC. There is a sliding scale of from 1-20% for families earning upto 200k.

32.<<<myboby123>>>
i can't agree with you more. for my niece, she knew she wanted to be a doctor from early on. she graduated from Rutgers with a full ride. She passed up smaller scholarships from several ivy leagues. she just completed her M.D. education at WashU.

my son, on the other hand, doesn't quite know what career to pursue. Last year, he was interested in law, now it is business. In his case an ivy league education makes more sense. I dont know where he will end up, but on our spreadsheet, parent funded ivy league option is rated higher than a full ride at a state school option.

33.<<<AustroHungarian>>>
I think if you decide to pursue the doctor route, go Rutgers. Paying for Yale tuition + $20K in debt doesn't sound good to me if you plan on going to med school right afterwards.

However, if you decide against becoming a doctor, I would go with Yale.

34.<<<rebel11>>>
I know some people think where you go undergrad doesn't matter.It does matter. A Yale education is like a Rolls Royce, Rutgers is a Buick. There is a difference.

35.<<<supercools>>>
Thanks everyone for the responses! I'll have to sit down with my parents to weigh the options. They're nice enough that they're willing to let me make the decision and assure me that I have their blessing regardless of where I go.

And I'm sorry if this wasn't clear, but my EFC was around 20K/year, and would probably have to pay off about 20K in loans.

Kinda smacking myself in the head right now for not taking a shot at Harvard (whose policies are much more generous for my income bracket) though, cause I just found out about Yale's policy to lower financial aid for my income bracket, lol.

36.<<<cptofthehouse>>>
I thought you said you would need about $20K for all four years of Yale. First of all, you are not likely to be able to borrow $20K yourself to go to Yale. Who would lend you the money? You are entitled to get $5500 in Stafford loans (I believe Yale leaves those intact for full use towards EFC) But where are you going to get the nearly $15K additional in funds? Your parents are going to have to get involved either in borrowing through PLUS or cosigning a loan with you, which is basically the same as co borrowing it and will affect their credit and put them fully on the hook for repayment. It's nice that they are willing to give their blessing regardless of where you go, but they are also going to have to give you $15K which may not be so easy to do. And then they will have to keep doing this each year. The price only goes up and Yale will be expecting you to come up with more of the cost each year, as all colleges do.

Your parents will have be in debt for about $70K before you are done unless they can be paying on the loan as they take it out. In ADDITION, you will be owing about $30K or more with interest yourself upon graduation. What kind of shape are your parents in to be able to take out that kind of debt? THey'll have to start paying, at latest, when you graduate and if you go on to med school, you aren't going to be able to help them with those payments as you will be taking out even more loans and accruing interest on that more than $30K you borrowed on your own. Is this even doable for them? Will this hurt their credit, their flexibility, their finances? Can THEY , not YOU, afford to do this?

T26E4, dunno why but all the "frankly"s made me lol :)

38.<<<supercools>>>
@cptofthehouse please calm down lol. My parents are prepared to pay ~17K each year out of their pockets.

39.<<<rebel11>>>
This thread is starting to emit the **** aroma.Did the OP get the Rutgers Presidential?? If yes it's 24k still leaving a few thousand a year expenses.

40.<<<Kdog044>>>
[quote]rebel11 wrote: Yale fin. aid pkg says No family contribution if earnings are 65k or less.[/quote]
Just to clarify the Yale fin aid policy, it is no expected "parent contribution" for families making less than 65K. The student still has a summer income contribution and an expected self-help contribution (currently $2700/yr) that they are expected to meet.

41.<<<cptofthehouse>>>
Then, you are fine. I would go with Yale. I've seen some families really hit hard because they so wanted to give their kids the best, the most, what they wanted, and they simply could not afford it. If you can cover the cost of Yale by borrowing your Staffords, working, and your parents do have the resources where they can make up the rest of the gap and maybe borrow some, I would go ahead and go to Yale. At age 18, you don't know what you will end up wanting to do and I do believe that this is an experience not to be missed. But it's not worth throwing your family under the financial bus for.

42.<<<litotes>>>
One thing to note is that it really isn't an advantage of Rutgers' that you have guaranteed research. Research is readily available at Yale with a 3:1 student:faculty ratio in the sciences. And at Yale, the professors you will be working with will be world-renowned.

(Nothing against Rutgers professors, of course. Having worked with a state flagship professor last summer, I know that they are great as well. However, there is something to be said for working with a professor at one of the top schools in the world.)

Hopefully I'll see you at Bulldog Days, OP!

43.<<<supercools>>>
@rebel11 yes I did get the presidential, which was $24,700/yr...I believe that's the entire cost of tuition and fees so I don't know where you're getting these "few thousand dollars" from.

44.<<<rebel11>>>
A schools total cost of attendance also includes books &amp; personal expenses totaling a few thousand dollars. Most put these costs @ 3-4K

I've gotten a lot of mail from state schools offering me full scholarships, stipends, iPads, all that jazz. I've talked to my parents a lot about it - especially because I'm fifty-fifty on going to med school, which is obviously quite expensive - and we've agreed that for me personally, the full ride wouldn't be worth it. I haven't gotten into Yale (and probably won't), but I will emphatically say that I would choose it over a state school any day. I would be much, much happier at Yale.

48.<<<YoHoYoHo>>>
For $20k debt, I would vote for Yale.
My friend, a physician who is at a prestigious medical school and hospital and in her 40s, picked U of Chicago over Harvard many moons ago for money reasons. Even though she is a successful physician and got there via U of Chicago, she still occasionally asks "what if?"

However, only your parents know their financial status and what they can or should be able to pay.

49.<<<Hunt>>>
So it sounds like the Yale education will actually cost you about $80,000, of which you think you will need to borrow about $20,000. That's still a very substantial discount from full pay at Yale (over $200,000), but it does make this a closer call. It's important to discuss your long-term plans with your parents, visit both schools if you can, and look carefully at the programs of study they offer. No matter what anybody says, this is not a no-brainer either way.

50.<<<T26E4>>>
[quote]No matter what anybody says, this is not a no-brainer either way.[/quote]

Exactly. If parents have to shell out +$60K and the student needs to get $20K in loans -- versus practically no cost at Rutgers -- the family needs to look at the big picture. Retirement funds, grad school help, etc. Nothing is clear cut. Regardless, nice options either way!
