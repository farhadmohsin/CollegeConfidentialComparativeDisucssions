[quote]Does having too many premeds make it tough in terms of competition and recommendation letters ?[/quote]

Define "too many".

There is always going to be competition for A grades. No professor in his or her right mind is going to give an A to everyone in the class, Additionally, some universities have formal or informal policies capping the number of A grades given. (D2's uni capped As at no more than 15% for the common freshman &amp; sophomore pre-reqs, for example.) How hard it is for you to get one of those coveted As is going to depend on the quality (not quantity) of the competition.

Do your high school stats (GPA, ACT/SAT) place you in the top 25% of the entering students at the universities in question? If not, you're going to have a harder time making the cut for As given the competition will be made up of students with stronger academic records and preparation than you.

For LORs, if the school uses a committee letter, then the committee will write a LOR providing the student meets the qualifications &amp; deadlines the health profession advising office sets out. (Now whether the letter is strongly positive is a different story....)

For universities that don't use committee letters, the individual has to solicit their own LORs from professors they have had for a class. Most professors will only write a LOR for students who they know well and who have done well in their course. It's singularly unlikely that it will be difficult/impossible to get LORs, assuming the student has made an effort to be involved in class and has met with instructors outside of class (office hours/recitations, etc). Writing LORs is part of professor's job.

Any information on SLU pls

4.<<<thumper1>>>
@twnz19 you can take the required courses to apply to medical school at ANY college. Your goal should be to attend a college with no to very minimal loans, get a High GPA, and get a high MCAT score.

5.<<<GoldenRock>>>
@twnz19 If you have not Medical Scholars Program or any need/merit aid in SLU or have any other personal reasons (like close to home), there is nothing special to attend SLU. You can consider UW or Emory.
What is your home state (WA?) since each of the UW and Emory schools spans across 2600 miles and SLU almost in the middle.

@twnz19
[quote]Any information on SLU pls[/quote]

Try asking the SLU-specific forum.

<url>https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/saint-louis-university/</url>

7.<<<twnz19>>>
Ok thanks

8.<<<crankyoldman>>>
Want..."school where it is easy to maintain high gpa in biochem style major".
This school does not exist; all premed studies at all schools are challenging and competitive.

9.<<<texaspg>>>
Many people go to SLU for combined program and sometimes dont make it. If that is not the reason, premed by itself may not be a big differentiator. Is UW in Wisconsin or Washington? Both are great schools.

10.<<<twnz19>>>
UW Washington

11.<<<twnz19>>>
Btw slu and Washu decision now ?

12.<<<twnz19>>>
@WayOutWestMom
Have a question for you
You said go where you are top 25 percent fir premed
My Dd has v high gpa with strong STEM high school courses
Gpa wise she is top 25 in both Emory and Washu
But SAT maybe low 25 at Washu
Sat mid 50 at Emory

She is thinking btw Emory and Washu
Please suggest what is better fit
She wants to maintain good gpa

Confused in picking one

13.<<<thumper1>>>
@twnz19

Didnt she have to make her undergrad matriculation decision by midnight May 1? How is t that she is still deciding?

14.<<<twnz19>>>
WL gives you few extra days

15.<<<thumper1>>>
So did she commit to the school where she was accepted in the regular round? Or did she get an extension there too?

I am a little confused...where exactly was she accepted on the regular admissions round...and which school was the WL school?

Are you instate for University of Washington? You do know...its a fabulous university.

16.<<<twnz19>>>
I am asking for Emory vs Washu

17.<<<thumper1>>>
Ok...so i think i have it straight.

Your daughter got accepted to Emory and University of Washington...and SLU.

But then got off the waitlist at Wash U.

So...did she request an extension at Emory, or UW in terms of matriculation...or did she accept at one of those...and now is trying to decide whether to accept the Wash U offer?

Costs are the same?

18.<<<twnz19>>>
Only chouce is btw Washu and Emory now

Cost is similar or close. More imp to know where is less competitive plus higher gpa chances
Hard work is not a prob
Loves STEM

Only wants good gpa with hardwork without working too much about grades so can focus on MCAT

19.<<<thumper1>>>
@WayOutWestMom can comment...but in my opinion...both Wash U and Emory will require hard work and working a lot...but then, in my opinion, every college requires hard work for students taking the premed required courses. So...your daughter should plan on working at both of these schools. Its not like she could work less at one and get a better GPA. They are both very fine schools.

For most kids, hard work and working sufficient amount of time go hand in hand.

Lets just say...when she gets to OChem, and biochemistry, her classmates will all be very sharp and motivated to do well...at any college.

When she is taking upper level courses, she will need to really be able to do some balancing to prepare for the MCAT. Is she planning to apply to medical school so she starts the fall after her undergrad graduation? Of so...her first three years are going to be solidly packed with courses.

20.<<<twnz19>>>
Good points ,
Should she go where she is more of a match or reach is ok
We dint understand how to find that
They are both great sciools no doubt
Does WL make it reach vs initially admitted to another school
She will work hard no issues there
I read comments go where you are top 25?
Why

If school freshman have a high stat as I read online
Does that mean more competitive or harder to maintain high gpa ? Classes may be curved

21.<<<BunnyBlue>>>
Yes. That is true. Going to a school in which the kids have higher stats means it is harder to get a high GPA. This is because, just as you said, so many colleges base their grading on a curve. So going to a college with brighter students makes it harder to get top grades, unless you are tippy-top bright and are still above the bell curve in ability compared to your classmates. We have seen that with our two sons, who are both in computer science and had almost identical high school grades and test scores. The one who went to the school in which students have a higher average SAT score is getting lower grades than the one who went to the college that was one step down in academic level. The one who is getting lower grades is still ok because you only need around a 3.0 average to be considered for jobs in engineering fields. I think for medical school you need to be at least in the 3.6 to 3.8 range (just guessing here, not sure.)

22.<<<texaspg>>>
I think Emory is a better choice for premed in terms of competition for grades. -This is all relative in terms of who might be matriculating to each school.

If you are a Washington native, not sure it truly provides better option than UW for instate residency. If you can afford paying for both undergrad and med school that is a choice you can make.

23.<<<thumper1>>>
I dont think this poster is considering University of Washington at all...and Im not sure why.

I think its between Wash U where the kid got off the waitlist...and Emory.

24.<<<GoldenRock>>>
@twnz19
Clearly state which university are you referring. Is it Univ of Washington (UW) in Washington state or Washington Univ (WashU) at St-Louis?

What is your home state?

Did you check what is the grading system in each of the school? A,B,C or A+, A,A-. Does it matter to your D which system?

Is there any early assurance program either at Emory or UW or WashU? Does it care about EAP or not?

Has she visited any of these schools?

Does she have any seniors (of her caliber) from her HS who are attending any of these schools to get feel ?

These things are more important than what parents (no offence to any one!)

25.<<<thumper1>>>
@GoldenRock the poster said they have not visited and likely wont

26.<<<Hamurtle>>>
WashU parent of a potential premed and the classes there are going to be hard. Chemistry and biology are going to be the challenging classes to start out with. That being said, the school has a collaborative environment.

Emory might be slightly easier to earn a higher GPA than WashU, but its not going to be a cakewalk either.

27.<<<texaspg>>>
[quote]Gpa wise she is top 25 in both Emory and Washu
But SAT maybe low 25 at Washu
Sat mid 50 at Emory[/quote]

I think GPA is never a good indicator for comparison (not sure how schools do this).

Attending a low 25% SAT school would concern me.

28.<<<WayOutWestMom>>>
@twnz19 Both Emory and WashU are going to be competitive undergrads for pre-meds. WashU has a reputation for being a real meat grinder academically for pre-meds. (Know at least 2 or 3 kids who went to WashU and ended up...not pre-med.... due to the strong competition. High achieving kids from excellent schools with strong STEM backgrounds too.)

Neither Emory nor WashU offer early assurance admission to med school.

Which school does your D want to attend? Fit is more important than the school's name. Unhappy kids don't well at college.
[quote]Should she go where she is more of a match or reach is ok[/quote]
More of match to be on the safe side, but, that said, I had one kid to go a reach-y school and she was super successful there.
[quote]Does WL make it reach vs initially admitted to another school[/quote]
Not really because you don't know why your D was waitlisted. Could be for a ton of reasons, none of them academic.

29.<<<Hamurtle>>>
WashU has Medical Scholars which is sort of similar to early assurance, but they take only about 20 students per freshman class and the minimum requirements for all 4 years is a 3.8 GPA and a qualifying MCAT score.

I can vouch for the intensity of the WashU science classes from talking to my son. His roommate for next year is premed and is barely getting Bs in his STEM classes. My son has about a 3.7 GPA and he claims that is barely at the average for a lot of WashU premeds.

WashU does have a committee letter requirement for potential med school applicants IIRC.

30.<<<twnz19>>>
@GoldenRock
UW we are not considering

I am referring to Washu St. Louis vs Emory

31.<<<twnz19>>>
@Hamurtle
Your son is in Washu ?
The premeds there are in Bs
I heard same as lot of students drop out
Committe letter is imp
With not v high grades it will be tough to get

You mentioned your son is at 3,7 and barely average for premeds
If premed are in Bs whats the gpa
Just trying to understand

32.<<<twnz19>>>
@WayOutWestMom
Can I pm you please

V confused here
Cant decide cause unable to visit due to exam dates clash

Regardless of school,
What I was thinking high stat in high school is not a guarantee for success in premed and why is that ?
Why would all not get in then why the drop out or weed out

33.<<<Hamurtle>>>
^meaning that for the top tier of premeds you better have a GPA of ~3.8-3.9 to be considered for a decent medical school. Despite what some schools claim about their rigor and how students with a slightly lower GPA will get into medical school, GPA is still important.

34.<<<twnz19>>>
That that may not be so easy ? 3.9
Thinking btw Washu and Emory

You says your son is at 3.7 plus its bareky average for premeds
And some of his friends might be getting Bs
Then with Bs how are they making it 3.7 or above
Or is it that with more Bs it might be tough to maintain high grade averages

Did not follow this comment
Could you pls clarify
Thanks !

35.<<<Hamurtle>>>
3.7 is a good GPA, but you need better (3.8+) for top medical schools.

Mys sons roommate is atypical. He still plans on premed even though his BCPM GPA is barely above 3.0.

36.<<<thumper1>>>
[quote]What I was thinking high stat in high school is not a guarantee for success in premed and why is that ?
Why would all not get in then why the drop out or weed out[/quote]

Because....college classes are NOT high school classes.

Because in a pre-Med course track, there will be many many very high flying students.

Because you cant predict how any student will do in college courses in advance.

Because no one has a crystal ball.

Because there is a ton of material to learn, and students have to independently manage their time, as well as study time.

And remember...there are weed out classes at some colleges early...and then there are classes like Ochem and biostatistics that can be very hard.

37.<<<twnz19>>>
@Hamurtle
Is he at Washu
Thats a positive that they are letting everyone apply

I heard that there are comittee letter that only v few get ?
Is you son a premed
Most seem to be premed there

38.<<<twnz19>>>
@thumper1
You make good points that college study is v different and how a student does in college may be independent of stats in school

I am trying to understand from many posts that say go to easy school or school where you are top 25 percent as weed out will be less likely?
Plus a achievable high gpa (of course with hard work) may give you more time to prep for mcat , ECs
What are your thoughts on this ?

39.<<<crankyoldman>>>
It is important to remember that there are no "easy" schools for premed. If you go to Harvard, you'll be with a ton of people who did very, very well in high school, scored well on standardized test, etc etc.
If you go to state U, maybe all admitted SAT/GPA won't be as high, but the premed classes will have plenty of students who are dedicated, directed...and yes, did well on GPA/SAT and went state b/c of money, etc.
So please, there are no "easy" premed classes, and premed is not easy at any school.
You'd be well advised to visit schools to see if your student prefers one over the other...although it's already May 3; weren't decisions due 5/1?

40.<<<texaspg>>>
3.7 is a very good average for premed at WashU. It is not enough to get into their own med school but it is quite good for that school.

What you should check out is what it takes to get into UW med school. Most students have their best shot at medical school in their home state (exception California) due to in state residency reservations.

41.<<<Hamurtle>>>
And any potential premed needs to have a Plan B. In my sons case he is also a CompSci minor at WashU and considering going on the Computational Biology track.

42.<<<Andorvw>>>
Getting 3.7+ GPA in schools such as WashU (or JHU) is NOT easy because of the caliber of your peer students and the limited A's in BCPM (sGPA) pre-med classes. Most pre-med students could end up with 3.5 or less GPA there, which is NOT that competitive at all (even for their in-state med schools).

Emory is "better" than WashU for pre-meds for your question comparing the two schools.

43.<<<twnz19>>>
@Andorvw
Does Emory have a higher average premed gpa

Thanks

44.<<<Andorvw>>>
For average pre-med students, Emory is "better" in the sense of getting higher GPA.

45.<<<Mwfan1921>>>
OP, did your kid choose WashU or Emory?

WashU is more transparent regarding their med school results, showing acceptance rate by GPA and MCAT. IMO all schools should make this data public. <url>https://wustl.app.box.com/s/1jp60uqzhcxte4xybktahqo3jl77y0dc</url>

This data includes results to both DO and MD schools. It does not include applicants from Washu's business and engineering schools, which I think is odd (and possibly concerning, because it makes one think that the relative acceptance rates of those students are lower, perhaps even below average).

OP, you will never be able to really get the data you need, as no one has gone through both schools pre-med curriculums. Neither school posts 'average' GPAs for med school applicants. Where a given school falls on the cut-throat to collaborative continuum is subjective and impossible to parse out only premed students. Suffice it to say it will require significant effort to earn a 3.7 GPA or sGPA at both schools. Good luck.

46.<<<thumper1>>>
If your student ends up applying to medical school, the only numbers that will matter will be YOUR kids GPA and MCAT scores. The school averages dont matter at all.

And the average GPA at a college is not going to give you YOUR kids GPA or MCAT score.

47.<<<crankyoldman>>>
Notwithstanding WashU's public statistics-which don't include a number of potential applicants-it is important to remember that there is no agreed definition about who is or is not "pre-med" for purposes of published statistics. In the WashU case, the numbers are not comprehensive, excluding two of the schools at WashU. In addition, these numbers only count those who applied to medical school for the first time, which would be after junior year at the earliest. So how many pre-meds were accepted at Wash U as freshmen? Or finished first year and didn't ultimately apply to medical school? Or second year, etc? Or applied years after graduation?
What about second or third time applicants?
Unless and until there is an agreed definition of pre-med student, any published numbers are subject to manipulation and are not particularly helpful. In OP's case, the question is regarding an incoming freshmen; WashU doesn't tell us how many of those wash out(sorry, couldn't help it) from pre-med long before the time comes to apply to medical school.
So the most direct answer to OP's question is: who knows? There's no definition of pre-med, and no school publishes the number of freshmen pre-med students, and then the number of those students who are still at that school and ultimately apply.
