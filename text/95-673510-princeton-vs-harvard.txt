There is another Princeton - Harvard thread on the College Search forum. In just the last few years, the change in financial aide and the increase in applications has shifted the equation of both schools to their role in highlighting and enhancing the personal qualities and skills of those who go there. It's the qualities and skills that set the trajectory of the careers of their students. For the students, the difference is more in what kind of stories play out in each school. They are remarkably different - Harvard is much more catch as catch can - gritty. Princeton is uber chill, supportive, live and let live.

6.<<<jomjom>>>
HARVARD is the BEST UNIVERSITY IN THE WORLD.
Princeton is not well known outside of US ( maybe outside of East Coast ). Princeton
undergrad are doing poorly on top graduate school admisssion compared to Harvard.
Harvard Law admitted 290 Harvard undergrad while admitteing 50 princeton ugrad.
Yale Law admitted 70 Harvard ugrad while admitting 22 Princeton Undergrad.
Columbia Law admitted 80 from Harvard and 25 from Princeton
US politics, wall streets, science, math, and other academic discipline are all dominated by Harvard.
Princeton is like second class Ivy compared to Harvard.

7.<<<TheMoment...I>>>
Why do you say Princeton is worse in math and science? I mean, you should remember that Harvard law admits many harvard undergrads cause it is HARVARD law. And, Harvard is much bigger than Princeton.

Of course, I don't know much about how humanistic subjects rank between the schools, but I know that as far as math and physics, we seem to be on AT LEAST level ground.

8.<<<mcmom>>>
What year are those stats from jomjom, and do you have a link? Do you think the numbers have anything to do with the fact that a typical Harvard graduating class has more than 400 more students than a Princeton class, or that more Harvard students apply to law school than Princeton students? I feel bad for you that your Math education has been severely limited, because only someone with rudimentary math skills would throw insignificant numbers around like that. Princeton could really help you with that.

9.<<<jomjom>>>
""Why do you say Princeton is worse in math and science?""
Harvard finished first place in Putnam Math Competition 26 times. Princeton
has won Putnam only ONCE. That is 26 vs 1.

"you should remember that Harvard law admits many harvard undergrads cause it is HARVARD law"
That is why Harvard is the best. Princeton does not even have law school and Princeton Ugrad is at great disadvantage when applying to law school.

Even Yale Law admits much more Harvard students, admitting about 70 from Harvard and 24 from Princeton. I don't think Harvard Undergrad 3 times bigger.

Really ?
At Harvard law : 288 from Harvard vs. 50 from Princeton.
That is 5 times more from Harvard. Do you think Harvard is 5 times bigger than Princeton ? or 5 time more student apply to Law school ?
At Yale law 70 vs. 22 that is about 3 times more from Harvard.
Columbia Law 80 vs 25 that is 3.5 times more from Harvard.

Do you really think 3-5 times more students from Harvard are applying to Law School ?

As I have discussed on another thread, grade deflation at Princeton would likely hurt Princeton's admission rate to T14 law schools since it is so numbers driven. I read somewhere that 75% of Harvard grads are cum laude.

12.<<<TheMoment...I>>>
lol jomjom, so the Putnam says everything? Plus, Princeton won the Putnam recently - doesn't that say something about our math department now? Also, its not like we sucked in all Putnam competitions - I'm pretty sure we did pretty well in other Putnam competitions. There are plenty of other competitions or awards that I'm sure Princeton has done historically better with.

As to my input on the Harvard vs Princeton debate, I say that both are fantastic schools, and anyone choosing between them should not choose on the basis of "this one has a better math/physics department." From what I know with friends at most other great colleges in the country, there is little difference.

13.<<<swissmiss3>>>
I think you should ask yourself where YOU feel more comfortable. As you said in your op, you feel drawn to P over H. Therein lies your answer. Good luck! You have a wonderful problem, you know that?

jomjom is a ****. For some unknown reason, Princeton attracts more **** than elsewhere. I figure it's the way Princeton refuses to get into a deep rivalry. You will see when you get there. There isn't the big Harvard-Yale stuff going on.

As for H v. P in real life vs. **** life? If you don't know what you want to major in, then it comes down to the intangibles. Harvard has a tad more prestige. Undeniable. But for the choice? It's about suburban vs. urban, and smaller vs. bigger, and the eating clubs vs. the Harvard social life. Also rooming. Harvard has freshman housing and then the blocking groups to form. Princeton has residential colleges/ 4 year or 2 year. If you do know what you want to major in, Harvard wins some Princeton wins some, some are tied.

As was pointed out in another post, in recent years many of Princetons top students have chosen careers in finance and consulting. For the class of 2008, 288 students reported that they would be employed in financial services or other services (primarily consulting) upon graduation compared to only 28 who said they would go directly to law school.

20.<<<Saugus>>>
What about for Undergraduate Economics? Princeton is better than MIT and Harvard in this category, right? I understand that we have Paul Krugmann and all, but I've been hearing people say that MIT and Harvard have better UnderGraduate Economics programs than Princeton. Also, does Princeton's relatively small endowment factor in a lot?

21.<<<jomjom>>>
Paul Krugmann graduated from MIT and Yale. He is employee of Princeton.

22.<<<hallowarts>>>
"Also, does Princeton's relatively small endowment factor in a lot?"

Princeton's endowment is hardly small.

In terms of total endowment, Princeton is only behind Yale, Stanford, and Harvard.

In terms of endowment/student, Princeton is the largest in the world.

the answer is no. to whatever question you ask. nuff said. back to my shadowy corner where I will plot the end of the world... but seriously, the differences are so minute at this level that the details are what differentiates the two apart. So this is really a matter of opinion and thus there is not really too much to argue about.

26.<<<TheMoment...I>>>
ok, global rankings are dumb - both of these schools are fantastic schools.

27.<<<Nick017>>>
Princeton's per capita endowment is the best out of any school. I'm not saying endowment size makes a huge difference, I'm just saying that Harvard's larger endowment is spread more thin, and you should be aware of the fact that Harvard devotes a lot more time and energy to its grad programs, meaning that while it has more raw money, a lot less of it goes to undergrad students. I'd say Princeton in economics, engineering, mathematics, and science has a very, very small edge on Harvard. And Yale for that matter. However not nearly a great enough edge to warrant choosing Princeton over H or Y should you prefer something intangible about H or Y.

28.<<<jomjom>>>
"" Harvard's larger endowment is spread more thin, and you should be aware of the fact that Harvard devotes a lot more time and energy to its grad programs, .....""

Most of Harvard's endowment is concentrated on Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Undergrad) and its Per capita endowment a lot bigger than Princeton's. Many of Harvard Grad endowments are not that high, HBS, HLS, HMS has only about 1-2 billion each. Harvard FAS, which is Harvard College and GSAS, has abt $25-30 billion endowment and its enrollment is about the same as Priceton's. Look at Obama's top Economic advisors, they all graduated from Harvard, MIT. no Princeton. Look at rescent Nobel Economics &amp; Science Laureates. Most of them got degree from
Harvard MIT Columbia Yale. no Princeton graduates ( Krugmann is MIT Yale graduate).. Look at Putnam Math competition winners. Princeton consistently ranked below Harvard Calteh MIT Yale
Duke Toronto Stanford .....etc. winning only once.

29.<<<PolPHD>>>
I go to Princeton. I would ignore the above poster's claim that Princeton is not as good at math as Harvard. The Putnam is a very narrow way to judge the math department. Princeton has one of the best math departments in the world, so if you are interested in physics or math, you should absolutely consider Princeton; moreover, many math and physics majors drop math to go into engineering. In this case, you would be better served by Princeton's engineering department than by Harvard's, which is relatively weak.

With all that said, I would not recommend Princeton over Harvard--at least not unequivocally. In retrospect, I might even have gone to Harvard. I think the Princeton administration is taking every wrong step, and in the upcoming four years, the university will not remain as strong as it used to be. Hear are some things you should keep in mind:

1) The collapse of the financial market will hurt Princeton more than Harvard, since we sent a greater proportion of our kids to Wall Street (alumni donations!). The career services center is geared toward people interested in finance and law school (and of course medical school, but that is a completely different route). While we do have strong alumni representation in many areas, our career services office is not well-equipped to connect us to alumni in Hollywood, Academia, Sports, etc. Although students should certainly be proactive in seeking out alumni, it is much easier with a career office to guide you.

2) Grade deflation will hurt Princeton. Students have always complained about grade deflation, but this is not just some minor annoyance. A recent article in the Daily Princetonian, <a href="http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/03/25/23135/" rel="nofollow">Some graduate schools, employers still unfamiliar with grade deflation policy - The Daily Princetonian</a> elaborates on some problems I have seen. Read the comments section. It will be elucidating.

3) While Princeton currently has a better social scene than Harvard, I'm not sure how long this will last. With the growth of residential colleges, people who do not go to the eating clubs often live separately from everyone else. This could be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for, but I have found that it further alienates people who were not as attuned to the social scene here to begin with (not that there is anything wrong with that).

4) Princeton may soon see more political activism than Harvard. At least, I can tell that over my four years here, there have been more protests/complaints/anger than before. Maybe this is because of grade deflation, or maybe this is because polarizing political events. Either way, this could be interesting.

5) Based on my experience, the Princeton alumni network is really strong. I see a huge difference between the way alumni share their time with Princetonians, and the way the administration here--Dean Malkiel specifically--is detached from student affairs.

6) Everything listed above--about statistics, name recognition, etc.--should be taken into consideration, but only lightly. If you do have the opportunity to choose between these two schools, please don't base it on which one is marginally more prestigious. In retrospect, the prestige matters very little when you are choosing among the top echelon of schools (Harvard, Princeton, Yale, MIT, Stanford, Cal-Tech). I think it's remarkably petty to argue that any one of these schools is better--"overall"--than the others. I think that all one could say about them is that they are different, and their character may serve different personalities better than others.

30.<<<cpenoi>>>
I always say about Princetonians that they are polite and don't drink the koolaide. So when asked to confirm a commonplace about the school, they will gravely state a disclaimer, and in doing so reveal a smallness about their views, a self preoccupation. Their fellows will not point this out to them, however, as they are too polite to do so. So, discussion is not as robust as it might be at old Nassau. Unique and exceptional qualities of Princeton are almost never mentioned on this forum by Princetonians. For example, the P-rade at reunions is so much the most incredible instance of social continuity and intergenerational support at a college that the mind can barely comprehend it. Former Secretaries of State and Nobel prize winners march in it with enthusiasm. Yet I have never heard a single Princenian express any special admiration for it lasting over 4 seconds. It is a wonderful place. Just don't expect to learn very much about it from listening to the people who have gone there.

31.<<<Mustafah78>>>
Very informative post, PolPHD. Of all the issues you raised, Princeton's policy of grade deflation worries me the most. The disadvantages of such a policy are made very clear by the students' anecdotes; the benefits, meanwhile, are virtually impossible to discern.

32.<<<python38>>>
@ PolPHD: I could be wrong, but wouldn't Caltech be less prestigious than Harvard/Princeton for something like, say, finance?

33.<<<hallowarts>>>
"Most of Harvard's endowment is concentrated on Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Undergrad) and its Per capita endowment a lot bigger than Princeton's."

- Not true at all. Princeton's endowment is slightly higher than Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences. 16.4 versus 16 billion (June 2008). Furthermore, there are more students in the latter (which includes undergrad and grad btw). Go **** somewhere else with more accurate information. Clearly on a per capita basis, Princeton's endowment is larger.

I have written, somewhere, a long post about my 25th Reunion and how it felt to march in the P-rade. When I entered Princeton it was still the old boys' club. By the time I marched down the hill and saw every single student in the graduating class lining the hills I was moved almost to tears. Races, ethnicities, genders. Princeton is a friendly place. Friendly and cheerful and earnest. And people can trash talk all they want and the only harm will be if some kid who would thrive in a green lawn/active social life/very accessible professors place will be swayed by the lemming-like drive to the identified prestige brand currently plaguing college admissions and go to Harvard when they should have gone to Princeton.

36.<<<Mustafah78>>>
But a recent Harvard alum assured me that the university has a very active social scene and very accessible professors (didn't say anything about "green lawns," though). What are you implying, Alumother? :p

A more serious question: did any of you Princeton alumni find grade deflation to be a problem while you were there?

37.<<<PDaddy>>>
There seems to be an implication in these Harvard vs. Princeton discussions that most students who are offered admission to one school are also offered admission to the other. This is not the case. There were 4,297 offers of admission by Harvard and Princeton combined last year. The maximum number of students who could have been offered admission to both institutions was 1,396, which would mean that approximately 2/3 of students could have been offered admission to both schools. However, some educated guesswork suggests that the actual number was between 400 and 800 students who were offered admission to both institutions. If we take the higher number of 800, which is probably too high, that would still mean that fewer than 40% of the students who were offered admission to Harvard and/or Princeton last year were offered admission to both institutions. In other words, this is not a choice that most admitted students are even going to face. If someone has more precise information on cross-admit rates, please share them.

Choosing a college is a very personal experience. If you haven't visited the campuses, then you should do so. It doesn't matter what the numbers say or what the reputation is, your choice of college should be based on where you think YOU will best flourish and where you will enjoy the best four years of your life. That sounds a little sappy, but I don't think it would be any fun choosing to go somewhere because of statistics and prestige and regretting later that you might have fit better on a completely different campus.

Stop approaching this from an academic angle is my advice. When it comes to Princeton vs. Harvard, you're going to do very well for yourself no matter where you go and what you major in. What feels right to you? When you have that answer, I think you might have found your college. =)

All this talk about feeder schools and prestige at this level is nonsense. The education is largely what you make of it, and it's also about fitting in.

All of these are excellent schools with their unique strengths and weakness.

Princeton is ranked 6th place (sic) in Revealed (sic) preference ranking. If a student get (sic) multiple offers, Princeton would be 6th choise. (sic) and Harvard is number one.

This is a misunderstanding of what the revealed preference rankings mean. The NY Times reported on this research in September 2006. The revealed preference ranking indicates what percent of students who were admitted to two colleges will choose one over the other. According to the research, a significant majority of students will indeed choose Harvard over Princeton. This does not mean that one is better than the other, only that the majority of cross-admits prefer one over the other. Yale also enrolls significantly more cross-admits than Princeton, though not to the same extent as Harvard. Stanford and MIT enroll a greater percentage of cross admits than Princeton, but only by a very small percentage. Cal Tech results were not included in the article. For all other schools reported, the overwhelming majority of students chose Princeton, by rates varying from 73% to 97%. This data, by the way, is several years old.

There is no question that in terms of overall cachet, among high school students and their families the order remains Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. A more interesting question is how satisfied are alumni with the experience they had and the education they received. I suspect Princeton would do very well on such a survey.

Look at page 26 for ranking. Page 6 and 7 also state that Princeton practices 'strategic admission', rejecting many top applicants. why ? because the admission comittee know that the top best applicants will not choose Princeton.
It also states that
Such behavior of Princeton is potentially costly to the actual "quality of an admissions class", with no clear benefit
beyond a higher reported matriculation rate.

2. The Princeton Review (unaffiliated with Princeton University) - In its "College Campus Visit Guide" (7th edition) it refers to Princeton as, "truly gorgeous, offering the best undergraduate education in the country".


3. "Insider's Guide to the Colleges" (2008) - (An annual college guide publication written by Yale's Daily News Staff Editors). The publication lists Princeton as the top school for undergraduate attention/focus. Left out of the running was Yale itself.

These rankings are all so stupid. If you think there is any difference in your education from merely attending one elite school vs. another you are completely delusional. I can make up any criteria and rank places. For example Nobel Prizes:

Columbia 88
UChicago 82
Harvard 75
MIT 73
Stanford 50
Cornell 40
Yale 34
NYU 33
Princeton 32

but this misses the point that some schools like Columbia and Harvard have leading medical research centers while the U of C has the most distinguished economics faculty of the modern era.... everything has to be given context. If you're interested in the hard sciences and engineering, state universities are generally stronger than the ivies because of larger faculty, government support, better facilities and much larger entering classes of prospective majors. After the weeding out process in the intro (but tough) classes, there is still a sufficiently large graduating class of majors in say EE, ChemE, MechE etc.

Since Wall Street is no longer likely to be the path to riches it once was, an ambitious person is probably best advised to go to one's state university, pursue a difficult engineering major, earn high grades and work for a technology company.

... also Princeton is an amazing school ... using silly statistics such as these as arguments that a school is better or worse is childish...

... the end.

74.<<<dome>>>
I'm not sure why you are focusing only on numbers jomjom. I mean seriously, why do admission rates matter, especially when Harvard and Princeton both have admission rates of under 10%...they are both extremely competitive. To choose a college on the basis that it has a lower admission rate is ridiculous, and it speaks volumes of personal insecurity and immaturity...

My advice to anyone fortunate to have been accepted at both universities is to visit. Pick the school that suits you better; most alumni will tell you that student life ultimately becomes more important than any numbers or statistics. Honestly, I don't care if a university gets 100% of its students into top graduate schools if the student life is absolute hell. Also, its not the university that holds you back from graduate school. You can get into ANY graduate school from ANY of the top undergraduate schools if you work hard enough. Its on you, not the college.

75.<<<Peytoncline>>>
jomjom, numbers don't mean anything unless there are percentages

76.<<<jomjom>>>
What I am trying to say is that ''Princeton UG / Harvard Grad school'' is very unlikely to happen.. because either 1) most Princeton UG don't apply to Harvard gradu school for some reason or 2) more Princeton UG are rejected from H.

The indisputable truth is that Probability( Harvard UG/Harvard G ) >>>>>>>> Prob(Princeton UG/Harvard G)

At harvard law school, there are 6 times more Harvard UG than Princeton UG (300 vs 50)
Do you really think that number of Harvard UG applicants are 6 times bigger than that of Princeton ??

77.<<<Baelor>>>
^Yes, I would believe that totally. Mainly because only now are Princeton graduates turning en (greater) masse toward grad schools. The connections that the graduates had to Wall Street, companies (even like Microsoft), etc. reduced the interest in/need for grad school.

For example, in my area, all the graduates (psych, ORFE, many engineering) either went directly to work for Microsoft/tech firms or went to IBanking/consulting of whatever sort.

78.<<<randombetch>>>
jomjom just makes up numbers.

But yeah I wouldn't be surprised at all if the % of Princeton kids accepted to Harvard Law and Yale Law is lower than Harvard's % at Yale or Yale's % at Harvard. Grade deflation hurts the most for pre-law and pre-med. Simply put, the average Princeton student (3.3 GPA) has almost no chance at Harvard or Yale law.

I don't mean to badmouth the school I go to; I'm just being dead honest with myself.

79.<<<jomjom>>>
[quote]makes up numbers.[/quote]
which number ?

80.<<<dome>>>
Another important thing to consider in the Princeton vs. Harvard debate is fit...sure, numbers can say a million different things, but when it boils down, the fact remains that Harvard and Princeton can both take you to similarly amazing places. I would say that calling them equally academically enriching would not be a stretch by any means.

Now, on to fit...perhaps a much more important factor than academics between these two schools. I personally chose Princeton because it fit me better. The campus is beautiful and peaceful, the students are down to earth and willing to work together, and the environment is less cutthroat. I did not observe these features at Harvard, though I am sure that they exist in some quantity, significant or insignificant; I would not doubt that for a second. Harvard has some advantages that would make it a better fit for others, including access to a city. Its all about what suits you best. People say to pick a school based on your compatibility to the student life, and that is how I made my decision.

81.<<<t-san>>>
^ = yes.
I don't really understand how people say, oh yeah Harvard is better than Princeton or Yale or Stanford or anything. When you get to that level of education, all schools are pretty much the same. Sure, there are strengths and weaknesses academically of each, but it's not like if you graduate from Princeton you are at an educational disadvantage than someone who graduated from Harvard. Both schools have shown over the years to do a phenomenal job at preparing students for the next level (grad school/jobs). So I think it's misleading to say - "oh, I'll go to Princeton because USNWR says it is better than Harvard." or vice versa. It really should come down to fit. The way I brain it, even if you go to Harvard because the highly arbitrary rankings deem it "better" than Princeton, if you were really a Princeton person, you're not going to perform at the level you could have had you gone to Princeton. The same is true for the reverse. So it really should be about where you are comfortable, and not what the numbers say.

82.<<<Alumother>>>
dome and t-san are right. My family has gone to both Harvard and Princeton. We are, on the whole sensitive, verbal easily over-stimulated, but very social, types who don't like to fight. We didn't like Harvard (my sister, brother) did like Princeton (me, my daughter, my son). Other people obviously love Harvard.

83.<<<jomjom>>>
If there is no difference between Harvard and Princeton,
then there is no difference between Princeton and NYU.

84.<<<4th house>>>
jomjom, as it appears that all you do is stay on the Princeton board all day and all night each and every day, simply to post how much you despise Princeton, I would say that there is no difference between you and a hemorrhoid. Both are annoying, both flare up uninvitedly, and neither has anything constructive to offer.

So, how long have you been holding a grudge because Princeton rejected you?

85.<<<Baelor>>>
jomjom, when did NYU top USNews? When did Princeton?

Harvard is clearly not academically superior to Princeton. More prestigious, perhaps, but not better.

86.<<<dome>>>
"If there is no difference between Harvard and Princeton,
then there is no difference between Princeton and NYU."

I'm not sure what you intended to achieve with that comment, but the difference in education between Princeton and NYU probably isn't ridiculously significant. Neither is the difference in education between Harvard and NYU. Sure, Princeton and Harvard have greater prestige and reputation, but their academics do not by any means blow NYU out of the water.

Unfortunately, given the ranking-orientation of most upper tier students, schools like NYU are often overlooked as weaker academically, when this is just not the case...I suppose jomjom was trying to compare Princeton to a "bad" school like NYU. It is honestly ridiculous the way rankings affect some people...ever consider that NYU has some programs and opportunities that are much stronger than those found at Princeton or Harvard?

And if you must ask for what they are...you obviously have missed the point my friend.

87.<<<jomjom>>>
Do Princeton students seriously think that Princeton and Harvard are at the similar prestige level ???? I am not joking...

88.<<<fiftyeightsix>>>
nope they dont give a crap, they dont waste their time like u do jom jom, staring at every possible number

89.<<<midatlmom>>>
I generally think it's probably better to ignore posters like jomjom, who are not very knowledgeable, have some sort of bias against a particular school and feel the need to post obsessively about a particular subject.

Princeton and Harvard are two of the best universities in the world. They, along with a host of other schools, provide a stellar academic experience. There is no best school--rather there are a number of wonderful schools where, quite frankly, most kids would be happy. I recognize that in order to make decisions, we spend hours parsing differences among schools (and I am guilty of this as well), but at the end of the day, there is no number 1 or number 2. Rather, there is a school that is the right choice for a number of reasons--either because it offered more money, or because you prefer cities, or because you had a great time at the preview, or because a friend of yours is going, or even because you think that it's number 1. I think that in order to make tough decisions, we all have a tendency to try and justify our decisions (i.e., Princeton has those snobby eating clubs and I don't like them), but there really is no need to bash one school at the expense of another. Students nowdays are fortunate that the overall quality of American colleges is very high and there is a great education to be had at so many places.

90.<<<jomjom>>>
Well... I am not bashing any school....
I think Princeton and NYU are the top schools in the the wxorld and many people says that NYU is academically as prestigious as Princeton....

UPenn students also often say that there is prestige rivalry between Princeton and UPenn, anyways.. and I think they both are top schools at academically similar prestige level....

91.<<<Baelor>>>
Penn Wharton is on par with HYPS in some circles. In others, Penn can't compare. This applies to all schools, obviously.

jomjom, I have not heard that at all from any Penn or Princeton student.

Yes, they do...In the United States of America, the two are considered equal...small variations by region exist, but overall, they are equal.

Unfortunately, the Yale thread is no authority...all of these statements are opinions. I don't care about the graduate school facts, because they obviously do not tell the full story.

You're information is flawed and biased, and you can't concede a single point to a school other than Harvard, which shows you are a whiny ***** trying to justify your own rejection. You don't know anything about life...you don't know anything about education. You are a shell of a human who doesn't really enjoy life. Instead, you try to get off by bragging about your accomplishments and pushing down those of others. No one wants to hear you speak. Not those who support Harvard and not those who support Princeton. Misguided ignoramus.

P.S.: Your parents don't love you; if they did, you would have been euthanized a long time ago to save yourself from the mental anguish and continual ass-whoopings that you are to receive for the rest of your life. May God have mercy on your deluded soul.

102.<<<ras22>>>
This argument is stupid clearly Harvard is superior to Princeton in every respect. Jomjom has brought up some completely valid points.
Princeton math only won 1 putnam and look at their math department it just all around sucks. Who would want to take classes from Wiles, Conway, Sarnak, Katz and Kochen? They should try to get some real professors if they want to be considered a good school. I hear Evan O'Dorney is looking for a job maybe they can get him.
Let me reinforce his stats as well. Harvard gets more people into law school than princeton. Admissions rate and any other factors like that are clearly irrelevant. Its basic logic Harvard law students > princeton law students => harvard > princeton. If you don't understand that take a logic class, but not at princeton because they only have ****ty logicians like Kochen and Nelson.

103.<<<Mustafah78>>>
Why are you guys getting so worked up by someone who's annoying you just for kicks?

Jomjom even said himself, in another forum, that he gets a kick out of the responses he garners.

Anybody with half a brain knows that Harvard>Princeton. Who wants to root for the New Jersey Nets? The New Jersey Nets suck. They didn't even make the playoffs.

Meanwhile, THE REAL STUDENTS IN HARVARD have the World Champion Boston Celtics, who managed to steal the 2008 Championship from the Lakers through excellent acting from Paul Pierce, as well as a bit of help from the referees. Princeton will forever be a loser school until the Nets get good.

In addition, Harvard has a 28.8 billion dollar endowment, Princeton has a 11.3! Ha! Harvard>Princeton

And Harvard is in an urban area, Princeton is in a suburban area! And we get clam chowder in our cafeteria! And our name and color are cooler!

And we have a graduate school! HA!

All of those factors are what make Harvard>Princeton

106.<<<Baelor>>>
Princeton has a higher per capita endowment, interestingly. I didn't know that until a little bit ago.

107.<<<jomjom>>>
Harvard FAS endowment ( which is Harvard College &amp; GSAS only) is about 17 billion plus
endowment of the administrations is also roughly about 5 billion.

Princeton's entire endowment ( including UG G administration wooddrow etc ) is 16 billion.

Harvad FAS has higher per capita endowment

108.<<<midatlmom>>>
Jomjom

Here is the latest table of college endowment per capita

While Princeton had only the 4th highest college endowment, it was first in the per capita ranking (these figures are as of 6/30/08, so obviously the numbers have changed, but I believe that Harvard losses were equal to or greater than those of Princeton during the last 9 months)

109.<<<jomjom>>>
I was talking about endowment of """"""""""""" Harvard F.A.S. """""""""""""

110.<<<midatlmom>>>
Since Harvard has 9859 undergraduate students and Princeton has 7261 undergraduates students, I doubt that you're right about the per capita figures, but why don't you show us where you got your figures from and then show us your math. Also, since undergraduates often make use of resources available to graduate students, including teachers and facilities, many would argue that the total endowment per student is the more relevant figure.

111.<<<jomjom>>>
There are abotu 6500 Harvard UG

Harvard FAS (including UG and Grad school) is about $16.6 billion + $5
billion for administration = $22 billion
Princeton endowment is $16 billion (including all schools and
administration) for 4900 UG
$22 bil/6500 > $16 bil/4900


There is almost no interaction between Harvard UG and Design School,
Education School, Kennedy School, Business school, Law School etc..
which have far lower endowment than FAS

112.<<<midatlmom>>>
Sorry, I used the wrong numbers of undergraduate students before.

1. Harvard has approximately 6700 undergraduates (according to the Factbook, there were 6,678 undergraduates in fall 2008).
2. I don't know where you got your figure of $5 billion for overall administrative endowment.
3. The FAS, according to the Harvard website, covers Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes a significantly higher number of students than just undergraduates. According to the Factbook, there are 3720 students in the GSAS and approximately 1400 degree students in the Extension School (not to mention an additional 12,000 or so who apparently take courses in the Extension School). In order to try and get a correct per capita endowment number for Harvard, you would have to factor in a significantly higher number of students, at least the 11,800 students seeking degrees in the Arts and Sciences, compared to Princeton's total undergraduate and graduate population of 7497.

As I've mentioned before, Princeton seems to be the favorite target at this time of year for "new" posters whose sole purpose is to spread false claims about Princeton during the season when prospective students are making their decisions. This particular poster sounds intriguingly similar to one who was banned from these boards about two years ago but I suspect it might also be one of the regular posters on the other boards who is an advocate for another institution.

Speculation aside, the above quote is just another example of the twisting of facts by this poster. There is no doubt that Princeton has a higher endowment per capita than any other school in the country.

From Harvard's website:

"2. Isn't Harvard's endowment the largest university endowment in the world?

The value of Harvard's endowment is indeed the largest, at least in absolute terms, among the 785 institutions reporting annually to the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), the organization that tracks endowment values, returns, and other performance indicators. Across a variety of other measures, however, Harvard's endowment is not the largest (e.g., on a per student basis, Harvard's endowment ranks fifth, behind Woods Hole, Rockefeller, Princeton, and Yale)."

<a href="http://www.fas.harvard.edu/home/dean-and-administration/deans-office/communications/endowment-faq-12052008.shtml" rel="nofollow">Harvard University | FAS |</a>

As for the above poster's numbers, the figure for central administration has been invented by the poster and he/she has underreported the total number of Harvard undergraduates.
Here are the actual numbers as published by Harvard:

% of Endowment
<hr>
Harvard Division

.9%
<hr>
Central Administration
42.6%
<hr>
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
43.5%
<hr>
Total portion of endowment available to Harvard College &amp; FAS

<a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/breaking-news/endowment-issues-each-schools-exposure" rel="nofollow">Endowment Issues: Each School's Exposure | Harvard Magazine</a>

As of last June with a reported endowment size of 36.9 billion, the above percentage leads to a figure of 16 billion available to Harvard College and the FAS Graduate School. The previously referenced article reports an even higher figure of 16.6 but, either way, it is clear that both figures include all administration overhead.

So, the actual comparison is as follows even using the more generous figure:

Harvard College &amp; Graduate FAS

16.6 billion/6,648 undergraduates = $2,496,992.00 per student

Princeton College &amp; Graduate FAS

16.3 billion/4,918 undergraduates = $3,314,355.00 per student

These figures are, of course, now terribly out of date. Since June 30th of last year, all of these large endowments have lost an enormous amount. It is widely believed, however, that Harvard's endowment has suffered much more than Princeton's. Published reports (confirming what I have heard from my contacts at Harvard) suggest that Harvard's losses may be nearly 50%, significantly greater than Princeton's. Even were they the same, Princeton would still have a much higher endowment per student than Harvard.

Please note that I post this only to counter the previous poster's false claims. I take no position on the relative merits of these two fine schools. When I chose between them, I opted for Princeton, but it is true that more students make the opposite choice.

114.<<<danas>>>
Princeton is almost always listed as having the largest endowment per student. An example, as of June 30th, 2008, in the Newsweek 2009 "How to Get Into College Guide", counting all undergraduate, graduate and professional school students. Of course the numbers have changed radically since then, though maybe not the order of schools.

Princeton $2,170,000
Yale $2,000,000
Harvard $1,820,000

Stanford, by the way, is listed at $1,200,000 and has racked up impressive fund raising in recent years.

115.<<<jomjom>>>
You have conveniently ignored Endowment funds for Radcliffe, Presidents, Auxllary Central
and Other Academic dept which sum up to about $7 bill.
Assuming 50% is to be used for FAS . Total Endowment for FAS is 16.6+3.5 ~ $20 bil

Princeton's endowment, excluding Woodrow Windon school , which is professional school, is about $14 bil

20bil/6600 >~ 14 bil /4900




Projected endowment for 2009

Princeton 11 billion minus woodrow W school ~ 10 bil
Harvard 28 billion about 50% for FAS = 14 billion

$14bil/6600 >> $10bil/4900

Just for a term. Long enough to know it is an amazing place, as advertised.
I'm very happy my daughter chose Princeton, though, for reasons having to do with the undergraduate social experience and access to faculty. I got my graduate degree at the University of Chicago and work there now. A great institution, but not strong on either social experience or access to faculty, at least for undergraduates. I guess I'm glad my daughter chose the "not U of C".

125.<<<cornfed>>>
A friend of my d who ended up at Yale(he dn apply to Princeton) just refused to attend Harvard as an undergraduate despite the fact his family had attended for generations.While he never addressed his reasons why friends of his family found out his mother was displeased by the sink or swim attitude displayed towards undergraduates(including his sister who had just graduated the year before he applied).

The number one thing our daughter appreciates is the social atmosphere at Princeton. She's not interested in eating clubs yet found that in no way has limited her friendships.She has four classes this semester and three have under 30 kids in them - she's a sophomore.She'll have her first huge class in the fall, Psychology, to satisfy a science requirement.

126.<<<Alumother>>>
Same thing in my family. My middle sister and brother went to Harvard and found it too competitive. Not like cutthroat people hurting eachother. Just that the type of people it attracts thrive on competition vs. thriving on belonging. I went to Princeton and loved it even though I didn't fit the social profile at the time. So, my kids are at Princeton. Even my little sister says that's where she wants her kids to go....

I agree with jomjom, Harvard is the best in the world. Princeton does have a very good music program (so I have heard, one that allows you to major in music while you are majoring in something else), but Harvard has much more to offer and is more well known throughout the world.

Who gives a crap which school is better? If one school has a higher rank and then, because you have some need to augment your ego, go there for the prestige, then what do you gain? Just choose the school that is best suited for you and stop worrying about which one will sound more impressive.

133.<<<natim1>>>
jillianseymour36: you say that like it's so easy, "Just choose the school that is best suited for you." Well, I visited both and have no freaking idea which is better for me.

134.<<<Alumother>>>
Actually, it's not a dumb reason if you met people who were cooler. Not when choosing between Princeton and Harvard. All else being equal, i.e., you don't NEED to be in Cambridge or Princeton Township, or you don't want to major in something unique that only one place or the other offers, choose the place where you felt comfortable. That stuff matters. The kids now feeling they like Yale or Stanford more than Princeton should go there. If you liked Princeton more, that's where you should go. I'm a Princeton alum. My sister and brother went to Harvard. Turns out we all like Princeton more. Nothing against Harvard, it's just a temperament thing.

135.<<<natim1>>>
but i don't doubt that there are cool poeple at harvard, I just wasn't able to meet them. Is my reasoning still good? Should I still go to Princeton?

136.<<<Alumother>>>
Put it this way. Why NOT go to Princeton? Remind me, what do you want to major in? And then, how do you feel about suburbs vs. cities, and how much do you like to fight? Then I will apply the eHarmony college match algorithm:). Seriously.

137.<<<natim1>>>
I like cities more than suburbs. I was entirely put off by the city of Princeton. But, I console myself with the idea that I don't ever need to leave campus. I want to major in economics, but maybe premed as well. I want to go somewhere where I can do anything and everything and be successful. I'm 17 and don't really know waht I love to do yet. Why NOT Princeton? Princeton, NJ. Fighting? hmmm. Well, I'm not much for initiating competition with others, but I never back down from a fight....

People don't realize how truthful this statement is at Princeton.

If you prefer cities, and you never back down from a fight, I'd say you might be happier at Harvard.

141.<<<poste3>>>
Havard, no question

142.<<<Gmanman>>>
Harvard is the best school on this planet.

Harvard >>> MIT,Yale >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Stanfrod >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> who cares

Gmanman, if you are so into Harvard, why are all your posts to date on the Princeton forum? What makes you so obsessed with proclaiming Princeton's inferiority? Are you the same poster that has appeared previously in other forms? Jom Jom? German_car? I really feel sorry for you as you seem to need to spend so much time disparaging a particular school? You should seek help.

Yes it does but her major is in a small department so she never had a large lecture class before psychology.
