I’m a high school senior smack dab in the middle of his college search, and my parents and I have agreed that applying Early Decision is the way to go (increases my odds wherever I apply, makes the rest of the year much less stressful, would be making the same decision a couple months later anyway if I didn’t), and I’ve narrowed it down to Colby and Kenyon. Both amazing schools. Both with things I love.
I love creative writing. Kenyon has that. I care immensely about the climate. Colby is carbon neutral. I love pottery. Colby has a 24 hour studio. I love the Midwest (where I’m from). Kenyon’s got scenic Ohio.
Any advice at all would be warmly welcomed.

Colby College has a new athletic facility. 2,000 fulltime undergrads.
Kenyon College has a gorgeous campus & over 1,700 undergrads.
US News shows that there are no fraternities or sororities at Colby College. Is Greek life important to you ?

3.<<<doschicos>>>
Kenyon’s athletic facility is stellar, IMO.
Lots in common with these two schools.
Kenyon is easier to get into and if you’re into creative writing, hard to find a better place.  And you’ll have access to pottery.
Colby might be further along in environmental space/carbon neutrality but Kenyon would allow for your own involvement in making strides in that direction.

College is a time for growth & exploration. Since you are from the Midwest, it might good to experience a different region of the country.
The admit rates are dramatically different. Colby accepts just 13%, while Kenyon College admitted 36% last year.
If your interest is about the same for both schoools, then consider an ED app to Colby College & an RD app to Kenyon College.
However, check to see if either school offers EDII as an application option. Looks like both schools offer EDII.
When considering small schools, 300 extra students can make a significant difference.
P.S. If you are seeking financial aid, Colby College awards financial aid to 46% of all students with a generous average discount of 68% via grant money.
Colby College’s outstanding financial aid is undoubtedly one reason for the very low rate of admission.
Also, Colby College is test optional with respect to the SAT and ACT.

5.<<<MWolf>>>
Early decision acceptance rates: Colby, 38%, for Kenyon, 70%.
What does your profile look like (stats, etc)?
In general, though, it seems that you like many more things about Kenyon than Colby.

6.<<<thelampposts>>>
MWolf–
Thanks so much for your response. I’ve got a 34 ACT, and a GPA around 3.8. My SAT is a bit lower, but if I remember correctly, both colleges superscore, and Colby is test optional (though I’d still definitely submit my ACT).

Kenyon’s distinctive national reputation resides partly in its programs for, and appreciation of, writers and artists.
While Colby does offer a pottery club, as far as I can tell it doesn’t offer much in ceramics through its curriculum, which, if the case, would be unfortunate.

8.<<<gardenstategal>>>
“The admit rates are dramatically different. Colby accepts just 13%”
In fact, Colby’s acceptance rate last year was less than 10%.  There is a ton going on for someone interested in the environment but not majoring in it, whether it’s enjoying the Maine outdoors or Jan Plan classes.   The art museum is very cool.  I don’t know about ceramics (at all!) but do know that the school is, in general, very generous in its support of student arts.  In fact,  they fund all kinds of things for students (from research to job exploration trips.)  It isn’t known like Kenyon is as a “writer’s school” but there are certainly people pursuing this path there. (Gossip Girl author among them!)  The new athletic facility looks like it’ll be great.  If you wanted to experience a different part of the country, I agree with @Publisher that college is a great way to do it.
Kenyon is a perennial powerhouse in swimming (so no slouch in terms  of athletic facilities) and has always been known for its excellent writing programs. It is in a lovely part of Ohio.
Both seem to have tight knit communities.  Being from the Midwest could be a bit helpful for Colby which has enjoyed a great reputation in New England for a long time but is a relative newcomer to the rest of the country.
I believe Kenyon offers merit for all students (which is attractive if you’re FP); Colby does not.  Colby has very, very good FA including their new program for middle class families.  Not sure how $ fits into your decision.
Personally,  I like the strategy of applying to Colby ED (if you like it enough to go if accepted) and Kenyon RD if you are deferred.  (Unlikely you would be rejected outright at Colby in ED round imo.)  I think your odds are good at Kenyon regardless.  Colby is trickier just because it’s gotten so popular.
You might want to look at what would be involved in pursuing writing at each (look in the course catalog) as well as fulfilling distribution requirements (and going abroad if that is of interest.)  Often,  doing that kind of hypothetical planning can reveal something about a program that makes it particularly appealing (or not!)  In any case,  you can’t go wrong with either of these schools.

Greek life isn’t tremendously important to me. Either way, whether it’s there or not, I tend to think there are lots of pros and similarly lots of cons. But the population thing isn’t something I had considered. As Publisher said, a difference of 300 students in schools this small isn’t exactly a small number. Thanks a ton–every new angle helps in making the decision!

Thanks so much for responding. That’s extremely helpful. I’ve begun combing through the websites, looking at course catalogs, internships, study abroad opportunities, etc. Kenyon (no surprise here) offers an extensive list of creative writing classes, while Colby, though offering some (I sat in on one during my visit), certainly appears to offer many fewer. Much appreciated advice!!

11.<<<capaldifan>>>
Both are absolutely amazing schools, so I can understand why this decision is a difficult one for you.  Both are on my daughter’s list as well, and she will be applying ED2 to Colby if she doesn’t get into her top choice (Bowdoin).  She ranked Colby ahead of Kenyon for some of the same reasons other posters have mentioned: slightly bigger student body, Jan term, and new athletic center.  She was also impressed by their career counseling department - they have a very dedicated alumni network which is great for internships, etc. She also liked that Colby is looking to strengthen it’s  relationship with the town of Waterville, so some great things are happening there.  In the end, I think it was about “vibe” for her - she liked the outdoorsy, athletic vibe at Colby a bit more than the creative vibe at Kenyon (but as I said, she loved both schools). You really can’t go wrong either way!

12.<<<Lindagaf>>>
These colleges are more similar than they are different and you won’t go wrong at either one. Kenyon is known for having excellent English and creative writing classes. It’s professors get consistently high marks. The campus is renowned for its beauty, though Colby has the views. Colby’s Jan Plan is a bonus. It’s a shame Kenyon doesn’t offer something similar. Both colleges get an A+ on Niche.
I agree that Kenyon has a somewhat more creative vibe and Colby has a more outdoorsy vibe. Personally, as I only have my daughter’s perspective, I would go for Kenyon over Colby. She applied to Kenyon and was accepted. She didn’t apply to Colby because she felt it was a little too preppy for her.
If it makes any difference, Kenyon might have a little more name recognition nationally than Colby, if for no other reason than a US president attended. Consider also potential future jobs. You’re more likely to have job opportunities on the east coast with Colby, and in the Midwest with Kenyon.

January term is an important factor to consider when attending a small, rural LAC.
It is, in my opinion, a huge positive giving students a chance to take one course for about four weeks that meets daily. Great time to travel abroad.
Try to get a list of the courses offered by, I carefully avoided use of the word “at”, Colby College during January term.

14.<<<Publisher>>>
Additionally, when attending a small rural LAC, it may be wise to plan for one year or a semester in a study abroad program.
Another option might be an exchange program with another US college (such as Pomona College).
Or do both.

A benefit to not having a Jan term is a much longer winter break to travel on your own or do whatever you want to do, including short term internships/externships. My kids definitely took advantage of that window to do a lot of interesting stuff while enjoying a break from campus and a different scene. 

16.<<<Lindagaf>>>
I can’t resist adding that if this student loves Kenyon and Colby, he should also consider Bates, if he doesn’t get into the others ED. Those three colleges have many of the same applicants.

17.<<<Publisher>>>
January Term–one course that meets daily for about 4 weeks–allows one to experience a different format (similiar to Colorado College & Cornell College in Iowa).
This should be interesting to Kenyon College students as I see several similarities between students at Colorado College & at Kenyon College.
Might be interesting for Colorado College & Kenyon College to work out an exchange agreement similar to Pomona College’s & Colby College’s exchange option.

For creative writing, Midd is better than Colby, though not better than Kenyon.
Adroit Journal’s list of the best creative writing programs:

21.<<<gardenstategal>>>
^List of some of the best.  The point of the article is that they don’t lend themselves to ranking and many schools,  even ones that you might not associate with writing, have some excellent programs.  So true!
But folks, it is November tomorrow.  The ED deadline is looming, and the OP is trying to choose between two schools which have presumably come from a larger list.  Why muddy the waters by suggesting the neither could be right? These are two great options, have been visited, and offer what OP is looking for.

22.<<<gointhruaphase>>>
In terms of overall reputation (which definitely should NOT be the litmus test), Colby is just a shade higher.
IMO, however, you need to think fit, because when you get to the level of these two schools, the outcome is going to be better based on where you will be happiest.  Yes, Kenyon gets the nod for creative writing classes, but there have been many outstanding writers who graduated from Colby.  The athletic facilities at the two schools are totally a wash (with the exception that Kenyon’s was built in 2006, I think, while Colby’s opens in 2020).
One relevant differential is financial aid.  Kenyon has merit aid while Colby does not.  This is why one person I know (with similar stats to yours) who was dead set on Kenyon opted for applying RD to Kenyon.   The GC felt there was a pretty good chance of admission to Kenyon ED or RD, but a greater likelihood of merit aid in the RD round.  I don’t know if this is true, but you might want to ask your GC about it.  This might counsel in favor of ED to Colby, but then again, if you get into Colby ED you would be committed to attend.
The good thing about indecision is that it means that you probably will be happy at either school, so  you are in a good place.  You can always flip a coin.

While OP has stated an interest in creative writing, nowhere has OP indicated that he or she will major in this area or pick a school based on creative writing opportunities.
One perspective is that exposure to a highly intelligent community is a great way to develop & improve not only one’s writing skills, but also one’s communication skills whether written or not. In this respect, Princeton University should be at least tied for the top spot.
Excellent writing & meaningful communication is not just about one’s writing style or talents, but is about intelligence & insight & thoughts communicated in an effective fashion.

26.<<<homerdog>>>
Kenyon does not offer merit to all students. I think it’s more like their top 10-20% of applicants. And I’m guessing it’s more likely to get merit in RD.

27.<<<homerdog>>>
And remember that Colby is pretty difficult to get to from the Midwest. Have you visited? It’s a flight to Portland and then over an hour drive. I would consider that in your decision. We really liked Colby when we visited and we are also from the midwest but it was just too much of a hike. Our S is at Bowdoin and it’s closer to the airport. Still a hike from Chicago but just a bit easier to get to than Colby. Our S also applied to Kenyon RD and was accepted with $20k merit. That location wasn’t ideal either. He could fly to Columbus but then it was an hour drive. If you can drive to Kenyon from home, then that’s more convenient.
I agree that it’s a great time to get out of your comfort zone and try another part of the country but consider how often you think you’d want to get home and if convenience for getting back and forth is important.

Thank you both so much for the advice. This thread has given me a ton of great new material to consider. In terms of geographic location, I don’t particularly mind a trek. The midwest is certainly beautiful, but so is Maine, and even with the added difficulty of making the trip, it might be good to see another part of the country.

Thank you for the tip. I’m incredibly fortunate to say that my family and I don’t need to worry about money when it comes to the application process or tuition. But you’re undoubtedly right that both places are wonderful, and I’ll likely love whichever one I (hopefully) wind up going to.

That’s really helpful. I checked the website, but I failed to notice the secondary list containing the additional 15 colleges. That’s helpful. As is probably clear given that I came to an online forum for help, I’m not the most decisive person. So, to ensure that the decision doesn’t become any more convoluted or difficult, I think it likely best I limit it to Kenyon and Colby. I’ve visited about 16 schools including Middlebury, Bates, Bowdoin, Oberlin, and other such overlaps with Colby and Kenyon (and I’ve investigated many more online), and after having given it lots of thought and consideration, these were the two schools I found the most connection with. I really do appreciate the suggestions, though.

In terms of pursuing creative writing academically, I’m certainly curious about it at the moment, though I’m hardly dead set on it. Among the many, many tours I’ve taken over the last year, one of the unifying factors has been the seemingly universal story of “I came here thinking I wanted to study [major], but then found after one class that I instead wanted to major in [totally different major]!” But, even if I find that it’s not the right academic pursuit for me, I would no doubt like to continue it as a hobby, and a bright, intellectual community would no doubt help with that. As I’ve said, I think Colby and Kenyon are the two I should choose between (rather than adding one more factor to an already packed decision), but your tip certainly helps me consider Colby for creative writing a bit more. Even if their program isn’t as stellar as Kenyon’s is, the bright community could still no doubt give me the sort of environment in which I could grow and continue pursuing one of my passions. Thanks!

Note that at this time Colby appears to be equivalently selective to Bowdoin. By U.S. News methodology, Colby registers a selectivity rank of 8th in its category, with Bowdoin following (closely) at 13th.

32.<<<homerdog>>>
@merc81 hm. Not to split hairs and I guess this is heresay but lots of kids on CC last year got into Colby and not Bowdoin. And lots of kids we know from the NE who we know would say Bowdoin was a harder admit from their school than Colby.
Colby’s process is a little different since they do not have a supplemental essay and consider demonstrated interest. So, they are turning down lots of candidates to protect yield and I think that affects their total acceptance rate.  I don’t think they turn down high stat kids just because they are high stat, but it seems they do turn down kids who haven’t shown enough fit and interest.

33.<<<merc81>>>
@homerdog: Your observations point toward a weakness in USN methodology. Their assessments tend to be too limited and rigid to identify important distinctions in some cases.

34.<<<homerdog>>>
@merc81 there’s a lot of nuance under the surface when it comes to acceptance rates…at any school.

35.<<<merc81>>>
I should say though that USN’s selectivity rank relies on a few factors, including standardized test scores and high school rank. In this sense, it is what it purports to be, an approximation of the relative difficulty of admission for the colleges considered.

I’m sorry if I missed that someone else responded to this specific issue – Kenyon does not offer ceramics as part of its academic program but rather as an extracurricular, community based program. Kenyon had about 3 wheels and tiny, narrow space squeezed into a community arts space. My kid who was excited about continuing with ceramics in college as perhaps a studio arts minor was very disappointed in the ceramics opportunities at Kenyon.

37.<<<doschicos>>>
I’m pretty sure Colby doesn’t either. Many college fine arts programs don’t. They have sculpture but not ceramics or wheelthrowing or many other areas of art that they deem more crafts oriented than “fine art” like weaving/textiles, woodworking, metalwork.

Colby luckily has a 24-hour ceramics studio, and prides itself on its pottery club (they brag that for less than $30 a semester you get unlimited access to a metric ton of clay). The fact that either college has any pottery opportunities at all is great, but I’m really astounded by Colby (hardly the first time I’ve said that about either college).

For an extended perspective on Colby, you may want to search “Colby Life Documentary.”
For Kenyon, though it’s a fictionalized representation, you could watch Liberal Arts.

My son was rejected at Bowdoin and attends Colby.  We are in New England and Bowdoin is considered a harder admit here.  Colby has exceeded all expectations for my outdoorsy son.  Fantastic classes and community.  Good luck!

41.<<<gardenstategal>>>
I too consider Bowdoin a tougher admit.  But I also know several kids who got into Bowdoin but not Colby as well as kids who got into both and chose Colby.  And kids who got into Colby but not Bowdoin and who chose Bowdoin when admitted to both.  In many ways, very similar schools, and my guess is that most students at either would have been very happy at the other but there are some differences around the edges.  Post grad, the BBC (or CBB) alum seem  to recognize each other as kindred souls.

42.<<<wisteria100>>>
Colby’s acceptance rate is so low in  part because it receives a ton of applications.  It gets more applications than most any other LAC.  They have done a great job of marketing and courting applications with fee waivers, outreach, test optional, no essay etc.  It’s a great school, very strong academically, beautiful campus, but the acceptance rate can be construed as being in part manufactured

43.<<<apple23>>>
Steering away from the Colby/Bowdoin discussion and back to the original topic of this thread:
My daughter is a senior at Kenyon. She is an English major with a creative writing concentration, and a studio art minor.  The breadth and depth of offerings in the Kenyon English department, and of writing courses in particular, would be hard to match anywhere. The opportunities are so plentiful that even in four years one could not exhaust all possibilities.
There have been many mentions of Colby’s new athletic center. Kenyon’s athletic center is among the best of any LAC nationwide. Considering that you did not mention a particular interest in athletic centers, I wouldn’t imagine this to be a deciding factor. Nonetheless, Kenyon’s is spectacular. Kenyon will soon have a brand new library, which might be of more importance to you.
In light of the your interest in creative writing, I’m curious as to how Colby made it into the final two given the colleges with stronger, national reputations in this area. (In the Northeast region, you’d have choices such as Hamilton or Vassar that are more oriented toward this interest.) However, Colby would be excellent for the study of English literature in general (and therefore would probably be at least good for creative writing). This, combined with its emphasis on environmental initiatives, might make it a good choice. Even at that, though, you might find that it lacks Kenyon’s artistic flair.

44.<<<homerdog>>>
@apple23 I agree with all of that. We met a creative writing major on one of our visits to Kenyon and learned a lot. Kenyon is such an amazing place for writers. And the athletic facilities are GORGEOUS. Probably the nicest we saw of all LACs we visited. I loved Kenyon. When we visited the second time, I went to a dinner with other parents and professors. I was impressed by everyone I met that night. Those profs love their job and are super impressive.

My DS just faced the exact same decision for his ED1 application. Two outstanding liberal arts colleges with beautiful campuses.  Both have outstanding facilities, wonderful professors, and tight knit campus communities.  After initial summer campus tours and fall overnight visits he felt that they were both really great fits for him.  I think for him the new athletic facility and the Davis connects career center is what ultimately tipped the scale slightly in favor of Colby.  Either way you cannot go wrong.  Best of luck.

If you might have missed it in your research, look into Kenyon’s Craft Center, which offers two levels of classes in pottery.

@thelampposts I hope all went well whichever way you decided to go! I just found this thread because daughter is very interested in Kenyon…somewhat wish we’d investigated Colby as well!
