I currently had 3 choices and wanted to have some views on the universities.

2.<<<DontPanic1>>>
If you want to live and work on the west coast after graduation, then go to UCSD. If you want to live &amp; work in the midwest, then either of the other two would be perfectly fine. If your in-state for one of those, that would be the one.

3.<<<boneh3ad>>>
DontPanic1, you don't have a clue what you are talking about. I was a mechanical engineering undergrad at UIUC and had job offers on both the east and west coasts at graduation. I know people who work all over the country that I graduated with. Both UIUC and Purdue have national reputations that can land graduates a job anywhere in the country. UCSD even has some national pull, though to a lesser extent.

I also know for a fact that UIUC and Purdue have strong co-op and intern programs. I don't know enough about UCSD to comment on that aspect of their program though. I can also say that I know MAYBE 1 or 2 people from my graduating class at UIUC in the MechSE department that didn't have jobs. I am sure there were more, but the placement rate was VERY high, and that was right in the middle of the recession.

4.<<<jimi7>>>
Im still in dillemma of choosing between UCSD and UIUC.huhu..

It's kinda trade off between the cost of living and the job available. More jobs available in San Diego but the cost of living could be high right..Im still thinking. Is it easier to get job where it's nearer to your university?

5.<<<Treetopleaf>>>
I don't agree that "It's kinda trade off between the cost of living and the job available". It's more true to say it's a trade off between ME at UIUC and EE at UCSD. They are both national universities that will allow you to work anywhere.

"Is it easier to get job where it's nearer to your university?"

Yes, that's true, but it's more likely that you'll get a job where there are jobs, and many engineering jobs are available on the coasts.

Take a took at the 2nd page.

6.<<<boneh3ad>>>
Yeah, you really aren't looking at it the right way. You can go to UIUC and get a job ANYWHERE!

7.<<<CSmajor5>>>
screw Purdue. Go either UIUC or UCSD. UIUC have great ME and EE department and UCSD have great biology and chemical area of study. If it's either ME or EE, go UIUC.

8.<<<boneh3ad>>>
Wow, what sound reasoning from CSmajor5. You know, I was thinking about going to Purdue, but I just realized, "screw Purdue"

9.<<<chuy>>>
Bonehead, while yes you can get a job anywhere in the country with a good engineering degree, it's easier to get jobs closer to where you go to school. There are more local companies that recruit. This is doubly true because if you can get a local internship you've already got an in with a local company. If somebody is looking at two very similar schools in different regions I always tell them to consider where they want to work afterward.

10.<<<CSmajor5>>>
[quote]Wow, what sound reasoning from CSmajor5. You know, I was thinking about going to Purdue, but I just realized, "screw Purdue"[/quote]

If you can get into both UIUC and Purdue program and pass on UIUC program is like passing on Stanford / MIT for Georgia tech / UIUC. UIUC is undoubtably better than Purdue in almost all engineer programs and will serve him better when he look for a job.

11.<<<boneh3ad>>>
chuy, that may be true of most schools, and certainly is even true of the top schools, it is not quite as pronounced at said top schools. You will always have a lot of local companies coming to recruit banking on the fact that a lot of people want to stay put. However, one of the key differences between a top tier school and lower tier school is that at the top schools, employers from all over also come to recruit, and lots of them!

For example, there are more new graduates hired from UIUC at Microsoft than any other single company, including places like U. Washington. That is because of the fact that UIUC has a very well known and renowned CS department. That means graduates are in demand even to companies outside of the Midwest. This is true of any school with a very well known department, and the more departments they have that produce in-demand graduates, the more likely it is that far away companies are going to come since they can come and recruit from multiple departments.

At a school like Illinois, where just about all of the engineering departments are very well known, there are tons of national and non-regional companies coming to recruit in addition to all the regional ones that every school gets.

I know tons of people, myself included, that had many job offers from companies on the East and West Coasts, for example. Tons. UIUC does not limit you to just the Midwest as DontPanic1 seemed to claim when saying:
[quote]<a rel="nofollow" href="/profile/DontPanic1">DontPanic1</a> wrote:[/quote]

In fact, I would argue that even on the West Coast, for any major engineering employer, a UIUC degree holds at least as much weight as a UCSD degree with the exception of companies that specifically target UCSD.

UCSD is a fine school. A very good school, even. However, it is closer to being a regional university than UIUC is.

I am a UIUC grad, and even I know that Purdue is a great engineering school that is essentially a peer school to UIUC. I would even argue that depending on your situation, it is not a bad idea to pass on MIT/Stanford in favor of UIUC/GT, as the atmospheres at each school are totally different, and those schools are ranked 1,2,4,4 in overall engineering so you certainly aren't exactly going to lose out on anything by going to UIUC/GT over MIT/Stanford other than a lot more debt and a slightly bigger "Wow! factor" on your resume. The difference in actual education is arguable.

13.<<<chuy>>>
I know, and everything you said is true, I'm just saying that all other things being equal you're better off going to college closer to where you want to work. Trust me, I know that you can end up anywhere. I'm graduating from Virginia Tech and have a job in Canada.

14.<<<boneh3ad>>>
And I am saying that unless you go to a top university in your field, you are better off going somewhere closer to where you want to work. If you are going to a top university, it doesn't matter as much.

[quote]those schools are ranked 1,2,4,4 in overall engineering[/quote]
just to clarify it's 1,2,5,4 . Georgia Tech is #4 and UIUC is #5 for this year's ranking

16.<<<boneh3ad>>>
No, they are tied at 5 actually, so we are both wrong (<a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/spec-doct-engineering" rel="nofollow">Best Undergraduate Engineering Programs - Best Colleges - Education - US News and World Report</a>).
1,2,5,5... Every year it seems like GT, UIUC, and CalTech flip around randomly in that 4,5,6 position.

For the most part, they would for schools in the top 5 to 10. I suppose somewhere like Goldman-Sachs wouldn't be recruiting as much at Purdue, but for normal engineering jobs, it is roughly equal.

17.<<<jimi7>>>
Thanks guys,
so ME at UIUC is really better than EE at UCSD huh?
I think UCSD is just quite attractive to me because it's a UC and it's a great research university.

UIUC is famous for CS and ME is not that bad. So, it's between engineering or somekind of wow of UCSD huh...Do you guys still think UIUC is better?

18.<<<DontPanic1>>>
I stand by my original statement, and I was talking in generalities; there are always exceptions. The rest of this thread is totally splitting hairs! His career will depend much more on his own actions (i.e., high GPA and having internships) than on which of these 3 schools he goes to.

19.<<<wiseguyfromhell>>>
Both UIUC and Purdue are excellent schools for engineering. So is UCSD. You wont lose at all by selecting any one of them. Hail Purdue.

20.<<<clfdwlr>>>
^Boiler Up!^ Have you seen Neil Armstrong Hall!?! That should make your decision for you.

21.<<<SLightManifesto>>>
I would count out UCSD. If you are looking at pure Engineering prestige, you can't nearly go wrong w/ anything in the College of Engineering at Purdue or Illinois-Chambana.

22.<<<Treetopleaf>>>
Which major do you prefer? I'd base it on that, and whether one school is much farther from home than the other.

23.<<<hadsed>>>
Wait.. why are you comparing EE from UCSD and ME from UIUC? If you'd do EE at UCSD.. why wouldn't you just do EE at UIUC since that's probably one of their best programs?

Edit: Went back and read the first post. You can change your major.. I don't think it matters for your first year anyway. Besides, you got into the college of engineering, don't see why they wouldn't let you change your major.. unless they're crowded or something.

24.<<<boneh3ad>>>
I honestly don't get the issue. He got EE at UCSD but wanted ME, and got ME at UIUC, so why not just do UIUC. It sounds like he has his heart set on UCSD and wants people to make him feel like that is the right choice. Assuming that transferring is easy, I would say that is a good choice, but if transferring is tough at UCSD, then it is honestly silly if he doesn't take the guaranteed ME department at UIUC, which has at least as good of a reputation out west.

This is the type of intellectual mind at purdue. Do you still wanna go there?

30.<<<purduefrank>>>
As the great thinkers of modern society often say, screw Purdue.

That my friend cannot be described as anything but fundamentally ground breaking and intellectually stimulating insight

Go either UIUC or UCSD and UIUC have great.. are synonymous with timeless intellect as well. Please, embrace me with the teachings I have missed here, I believe Ive been cheated out of an education.

31.<<<clfdwlr>>>
Purduefrank is it just more or does it seem that CSmajor may have some bitter feelings towards Purdue. Possibly because he is not intellectual enough to have been accepted?

<b>OH SNAP, GET BIG!</b>

Let's hear CSmajor's comeback now.

34.<<<hadsed>>>
CSmajor5 you make a lot of stereotypes. I think that you need to base your claims on more than just your own experiences and feelings (that's what women do and that's why they make men miserable).

35.<<<CSmajor5>>>
I didn't even bother to send application to purdue since I didn't wanna waste my application fee for purdue and not worth my time. When I was in high school, I got accepted to Emory, Georgia Tech, university of virginia, and university of washington. Decide to go Georgia tech since its my state school and currently doing my master program.

I think of purdue as not better engineer program than UIUC. Some may say differently but that's how I feel. If someone ask me to choose between UIUC and Purdue, I will choose UIUC anyday.

I guess in purdue, they give out ridiculous test like the one you posted. 3 blanks and fill in the blank with goodies. I see why some purdue civil engineers are the cause for falling bridges.

36.<<<clfdwlr>>>
CSmajor, you have absolutely terrible grammatical skills. You are a dweeb. Get out of here. The OP is asking about the facts and the nature of the schools rather than some angry dick's opinion. Get out of here.

37.<<<boneh3ad>>>
CSmajor5, did they not teach English in Georgia? I am a UIUC grad, and even with our "rivalry" with Purdue, I will still admit that all this stuff you are saying about Purdue is pure drivel.

Honestly, don't offer kids "help" if you aren't going to be objective and check your facts.

38.<<<CSmajor5>>>
I have checked the fact between UIUC and Purdue. Almost all majors, UIUC is better beside Aerospace. UIUC is in top 5 engineer school where as purdue is in 12th in graduate school ranking.

I am typing on mytouch so don't expect correct spelling or no grammatic error. I am giving the op my opinion and advise and whether he take my advise or not, its entire up to him.

39.<<<clfdwlr>>>
We are not even talking about graduate school though, and Purdue is in the top 10. There are many other facts that should be considered as well. Rankings also don't make schools exactly what the OP is looking for. I think you should just leave CC. I have read your other posts, and they are also worthless, mean, and highly opinionated.

40.<<<boneh3ad>>>
Faulty logic in CSmajor5's last post:
1) Rankings are the end all, be all when it comes to school quality
2) A top 5 school is great, while a top 15 school is crappy
3) Typing on a mytouch causes grammatical errors.

Correct logic:
1) Rankings are only one of many factors to take into consideration when choosing a school.
2) A top 5 school is great, and so is a top 15 school. At some point, the subjectivity of the rankings even makes it difficult to really say one top school is "better" than another.
3) A mytouch or iPhone or what-have-you will certainly cause typos, but it cannot cause a gross misuse of the English language or the complete disregard of subject-verb agreement. Now, maybe English isn't your first language, in which case I apologize, but don't blame it on your mytouch.


Faulty logic in <b>my</b> post:
1) The lack of credibility of CSmajor5 has something to do with his/her grammar.

Correct logic in <b>my</b> post:
1) The lack of credibility of CSmajor5 has everything to do with the misinformation being spread with each post.
<hr>

Please, for Pete's sake, just think about what you are saying before you say it. The posters here need objective facts and advice 95% of the time, not subjective, and in this case, misinformed opinions. You could convince some high schooler not to go to Purdue based on your unreasonable bias, when in reality, he may be an absolutely perfect fit for their school and program.

41.<<<Zippidyduda>>>
All three are excellent schools, but only one of those schools is located in the most beautiful place in America. Guess which ;)

Coming from a UCSD incoming freshman, of course, haha.

42.<<<boneh3ad>>>
I have no argument that UCSD is the most beautiful of those 3 locations (at least as far as the surroundings go). I would probably argue against it being the most beautiful place in the country overall, though, hehe.

43.<<<CSmajor5>>>
There are clear reasons why some schools are in top 10 catagory. When comparing schools with 1 to 2 ranking difference, I can't say for sure which school is better than the others clearly, however when the rank difference is 7, there are clear reasons as to why other school is ranked higher. Reasons possibly include research, funding, faculty, quality of education and etc.

All the ground breaking discovery and research is done by graduate students / postdoc and the professors. It's better to measure the engineer school by graduate school ranking than undergraduate program ranking.

Purdue is great engineer school but I wouldn't say it's par with UIUC.

44.<<<clfdwlr>>>
Except for Undergrad the difference is 4, not 7. UIUC is 5, Purdue is 9. Read a book.

45.<<<boneh3ad>>>
Additionally, if you are basing your opinion on the rankings alone, why aren't you ragging on UCSD?

46.<<<Balthezar>>>
This thread is a perfect example of why CC is such a blessing and a curse. CSMajor5 spouts ridiculous drivel risking many of the less experienced CC readers being misled. Although I'm sure most people on this board can recognize informed opinion as opposed to clueless BS, some might not. It's nice to see people being diligent in calling posters to support their positions from time to time.

47.<<<MSORSA>>>
It's always easier to land a job locally for the following reasons: mostly all the major companies will try to pick the best out of the best Universities. But there is a lot of small companies out there without the funds or the will to go to out and scout Colleges out of their state. So by staying locally your chances of landing a job are greater. However I see that you are comparing 2 different fields of engineering. EE goes hand in hand with Comp Eng and not ME. If you really like ME you will probably hate EE. Chosing a secondary option just to stay close will only frustrate you at the end if you really wanted to study ME.

48.<<<machman>>>
Acknowledgment only lends to credibility.

49.<<<jimi7>>>
I was really behind a bit of all this but somehow the arguments here are quite remarkable
By location and job i quite think that being close to some place make it easier to take jobs especially when it comes to part time job or summer job or internship and so on,right? it's because I would be familiar with the place and the cost of transportation would be less.

that is to compare between La Jolla in CA and Urbana in Illinois. I search the craiglist and engineering jobs are much more in La Jolla area than Illinois. besides California is still california right? But I know for job after graduate, it may not be limited to certain places.

The interest between ME or EE? I'm still undecided actually. I wanted to test the water first.haha

50.<<<boneh3ad>>>
I know literally TONS of people that I went to school with at UIUC who had internships and summer jobs in California, Seattle and various other "far away" locations. Like I said, at a nationally renowned engineering program, companies from across the country recruit for both full time and summer jobs. I know plenty of people who worked for Northrop, Boeing, Lockheed, Intel, Microsoft, NASA and various other companies across the country just as interns over the summers.
