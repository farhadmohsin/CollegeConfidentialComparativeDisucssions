I was one of the students fortunate enough to be in the situation to make this decision. Although I told myself I would not post this and make the decision on my own, I have 5 days left to make my decision and am very, very confused as to what would be the best option.
I have already heard the “you can’t go wrong either way” statement many times over, and I truly am grateful for that, but at this point, I really just need advice. What would you do if you were in my shoes and why?
Specifics of each of the schools:
Harvard - no med school guarantee (so would have to take MCAT, maintain high GPA, etc.), plenty of research opportunities, well-recognized school that would allow for interests in cross-disciplinary fields to really be cultivated (Health Economics, Health Policy, etc.) and have an impact, Boston would allow for a lot of internship/other interest opportunities
Northwestern HPME - top 20 med school guarantee, no MCAT, 3.7 (regular)/3.55 (science) GPA requirement, 3 UG + 4 Med School (can opt in for an extra year of undergrad or a gap year or both), must complete all regular PreMed requirements, can apply out, Chicago would allow for a lot of internship/other interest opportunities, one of the top med schools in the area (as Midwest does not have as many research med schools as the Northeast for instance)
Brown PLME - top 40 med school guarantee, no MCAT, 3.0 GPA requirement, SUPER chill (do not have to complete all of the regular PreMed requirements), 4 UG + 4 Med (can opt-in for an extra year of undergrad or a gap year or both), cannot apply out, Providence is not really a huge city to allow for internships in other fields to be cultivated, Open Curriculum is really nice for exploration
In terms of how set I am on medicine, I am 100% set on medicine; however, I am also particularly interested in going into Health Economics research and Health Policy later in my life as well, which maybe Harvard would give a leg up on, to truly make influential public policy change, for example? Also, even though the guarantee is nice, I feel like I would still work hard to try to maintain high grades, be involved in extracurriculars, and do some research on the side. Definitely though, not having to take the MCAT and doing the applications is NICE.
So, what are everyone’s thoughts? (Also, I know not to base my decision based off of a forum lol, I just wanted to hear everyone’s opinions. Additionally, I know there are others in this situation as well who would benefit from this post).
Thanks again!

Are there significant cost differences for undergraduate and undergraduate + medical school?
Brown with just a 3.0 college GPA requirement will be the least stressful path to medical school, particularly with Brown’s high grade inflation and open curriculum.
A 3.7 college GPA (to retain the Northwestern assurance or to be competitive applying to medical school the usual way) is generally a lot harder than a 3.7 high school GPA.
Remember that the regular way of applying to medical school involves doing dozens of applications at thousands of dollars in cost hoping to get one admission (fewer than half of applicants get any admission).  This after chasing grades in college (possibly foregoing academic enrichment opportunities that may carry grade risk due to being harder) and doing extensive MCAT prep.

3.<<<privatebanker>>>
Orgo pass fail at Brown is a premed dream.  A semester abroad is possible too.  And the liberal arts major of some sort like history or something like public health might be kind of a nice path versus the hard science route.

4.<<<CU123>>>
This is entirely dependent on who you are.  Do you like competition, can you work hard over a sustained period of time?  Do you like putting a lot of effort in? Are you detailed oriented? Do you want to rise to the top of your field?  If so then it would go Harvard, Northwestern, Brown.  If you answer no to any of these then its Brown, Northwestern, Harvard.  Only you know yourself well enough to make this decision.  By any measure it would be far better to ask someone who knows you well then anyone here on CC.
P.S.  My guess is just from the fact you are coming here to ask is that you should go to Brown.

5.<<<confusedcat123>>>
Thank you for the responses @ucbalumnus and @privatebanker
The cost is the same among all three schools, and I am planning to major in something related to Economics, International Relations, Public Policy, or Public Health (i.e. something that is not Hard Sciences), regardless of which school I attend. I think it’s important to have different perspectives and background to complement the field that one hopes to pursue.
What exactly makes Orgo so difficult? Also, what would your ranking of my three options be and why?

6.<<<confusedcat123>>>
Also, in terms of foregoing the MCAT and (in particular) not taking all of the PreMed classes as student in the Brown PLME program, I feel like I would not be as prepared as someone who has just done those things once I get to med school. But I have also heard that the content of med school is not really related to PreMed material and MCAT material, anyways, so it shouldn’t really make that much of a difference?

7.<<<Sunny66>>>
I am not a doctor or in a health-related field, but I would choose between Brown or Northwestern. Already into med school seems to be too good to pass up. Given your accomplishments, the grade reqs at NU do not seem like a big risk. Brown seems to be the more relaxed experience, but if you think 8 years in Providence would make you go stir crazy, NU is a great option. Then again, I am sure you would do great going to Harvard, but it would be more stressful to take the MCAT and apply to med school.

8.<<<privatebanker>>>
The term hard science does not mean more difficult. It’s used to delineate between stem and social sciences. FYI.
What makes orgo so hard?  You’d have to ask an organic chemist or former premed.
I would go to Brown.  It’s an excellent school and great city. Plus you can use the next four years to explore. Take a class at RISD while you’re there.  And go overseas.  These usually aren’t options for the non plme premed.  You can get a 3.0 at brown, no problem.  Take something different. Take Russian or Chinese.  Pass fail.  You don’t have to try and impress a committee or another round of admissions.  Or an mcat.

9.<<<confusedcat123>>>
@CU123 I appreciate your rankings and the questions. To be honest, I have been leaning (albeit slightly) Harvard, but I am being told that this is not really advisable as med school admissions have almost become a crapshoot and “a bird in hand is worth than two in the bush” or whatever. I know that I will continue to work just as hard as I have inhigh school, but as someone who went to a public high school, I definitely know that my experience was a “big fish in smallish pond” type of thing. Additionally, I have also been told that in order to stand out to med school, one is better advised to go to a state school where they can really stand out, rather than a school like Harvard where everyone is talented. I suppose my concern is that I may be setting myself to work really, really hard (which I definitely and willingly will) only to find that I am inevitably set to end up at a lower tier med school when I could have easily taken a top BS/MD and really spent time on personal development and enrichment experiences. What would be your thoughts on this?

10.<<<confusedcat123>>>
@privatebanker I realize that “hard science” does not mean more difficult haha. I just meant that I am really trying to branch out and enrich myself by pursuing different majors as well (i.e. I will not be a biochemistry major at any of these schools). Thank you for your input, btw!

11.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
I would spend time on personal development and enrichment experiences.
“I am also particularly interested in going into Health Economics research and Health Policy later in my life as well, which maybe Harvard would give a leg up on”
I doubt it.  Both Brown and NU are essentially on the same tier as Harvard when it comes to academic prestige or any kind of prestige.

12.<<<privatebanker>>>
Lol.  Thought so, but couldn’t 100%  tell from your response if you had misconstrued my earlier post.
Remember.  Plme doesn’t make you attend Brown.  If your ug record is as accomplished as you envision, you can apply anywhere. The guarantee falls away, as you know. It won’t matter.
I don’t see the down side.
And being a top grad out of brown med won’t keep you out of any residency or specialty in the country.
I would suggest you start to lose the high school ranking ideation as soon as possible.
Surgeons from university of nowhere scrub up with Harvard grads all day long.

13.<<<CU123>>>
Reading between the lines I am seeing Brown, and you are right in the fact you will be attending schools with incredibly talented individuals who may out shine you.  So given that, JMHO is that you should go to Brown. BTW you get ANOTHER chance to compete against incredibly talented people except you have a guaranteed slot at a T40 med school.  In the end it will be how you finish med school (not undergrad) that will determine your future in the medical field.

14.<<<gallentjill>>>
My D has similar interests to you and recently accepted the Union/LIM program. In some ways a more difficult choice since AMC is not a topped ranked medical school as yours are.  However, the ability to forego the MCAT and receive a Masters or MBA in health management at the same time was too good to give up.  If you were my child and 100% set on medicine I would urge you to forget Harvard and choose one of the other two excellent options.  Personally, I would suggest Brown, but either would be better than Harvard. This is doubly true if you are an ORM (Asian or Indian). The stats for admission to ANY US medical school are dismal and getting lower each year.  Even excellent candidates with high grades and MCAT scores are finding difficulty.  I would absolutely not throw away a guarantee of admission to one of these two excellent US schools.

15.<<<anon145>>>
Brown!!!  (I have no allegiance to any of those schools) -  no one cares where you went to med school if you are a clinician (make your living seeing sick people).   (it only matters if you are going into academic research and even then it’s not that critical) . Brown is notorious for grade inflation too, if you switch fields.   Brown kids have some of the highest GPAs accepted to med school since the grade inflation is so rampant (Chicago among the lowest).  Throw in some study abroad to break up being in providence that long.   Accept it and be thrilled.  A friend’s kid went to Wash U. with the somewhat guaranteed admit to med school, the kid hit the required GPA to get into Med school there but also got into Columbia Med school and went there.  The point is it was very stressful environment for the kid (from the kids own experience) and in the end the kid went elsewhere (better med school) anyway.  Enjoy life - it will have no impact on your income potential.  If you get a 3.8 or higher at Brown (very feasible) you might be able to get into another T40 med school anyway if you really can’t stand it.

16.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
If top-20 med school at a great location is important to you, NU is the choice (I think their admission stats are MCAT of 520 and Avg GPA of 3.9 with 2% admit rate!!). If top-40 med school is fine enough and Providence is ok, then Brown. The fact that you come to ask tells me Harvard may not be the suitable choice because to me, you should pick that one if you have no regret regardless of the outcome.

17.<<<NCKris>>>
Harvard and Brown are quite different environments, and you would obviously know where you fit better.
If you are highly competitive and hard working type, then you will be able to do well at H and apply to Med school.
More than 90% of Med school applicants apply after 4 years of UG.
If it were my kid, I would advise going to Brown, not only for the guaranteed 8 year program, but if you happen to change your mind about medicine, you would still have a great UG experience.
Congrats on your acceptances, and go with your gut.

18.<<<tdy123>>>
The two possible reasons you gave for Harvard - Health economics and/or health public policy - don’t even remotely require an MD. For those fields a JD or Econ PhD (or dual JD/PhD if you really wanted to load on the qualifications) would serve you far better.
Sure, it can be tough to turn down Harvard, but someone “100%” sure they want an MD should take the guaranteed med school admit and be very happy…

19.<<<i012575>>>
I agree with most of the above posters. Select a "semi’-guaranteed top notch MD program. We deliberated quite a bit for my D1 - admitted to Harvard and a couple of other Ivies for undergrad. But at the end, Pitt’s GAP for their SOM was too hard to pass up. She is now in her 3rd year at Pitt Med (13th in the latest US News Med school rankings)… safe but wise choice from her perspective as well.

20.<<<SincererLove>>>
Northwestern. You save one year of school with the catch of keeping higher GPA. You want to condition yourself for hard work at medical school anyway. Having a goal would be good.

21.<<<mamalion>>>
Faculty here: I have a senior who has done it all right at Big State School.  At the moment he is waitlisted  at four med schools. Imagine the stress. Even though I love Harvard, a family school, I say take the easiest route, Brown, and use the freedom to develop your mind.

22.<<<privatebanker>>>
I agree. Having a goal is good. Having your goal guaranteed in advance is better.  Very few premeds look at their four years of ug with the same warm memories.  You won’t turn into some lazy student at Brown. It’s brown university people.  I would say most would say brown over nu although both excellent. But brown plus a guaranteed entrance to med school with 3.0 and no mcat. Has the world gone crazy!
Direct quote from a plme second year. The single greatest gift she has ever received in college is taking orgo pass fail.  She’s actually enjoying herself and taking other interesting classes. One is a medical related design class at risd.   Still doing incredibly well. Maybe because of the less stress and more sleep.

23.<<<JenniferClint>>>
NU BS/MD would be my pick (didn’t look to see if finances are a concern)
^ Did not realize that Brown wants a 3.0 and NU wants a 3.7. I would definitely pick Brown. That’s a huge difference in expectations.

24.<<<privatebanker>>>
@JenniferClint  I know you preferred greater detail on the various Princeton over Duke threads, can you say why you state this recommendation so briefly ?
Nu with. 3.7 minimum gpa and other requirements is not an easy hill to climb.

25.<<<StanfordGSB00>>>
Congrats on your great options. There is no wrong answer. If your goal is to go to a top medical school, then Harvard should be out. I personally know of 10 plus students who went to HYP and did the premed track. They all ended up at fine med schools but only 2 went to a top 20 med school. The other 8 had great scores and gpas but you have to remember that top med schools combine the randomness / holistic nature of top college / MBA admissions plus the stringent grade / test requirements that top law schools require. In other words, top med schools are a total gamble for anyone. Most of the acceptance rates at T 20 medical schools are less than 5 percent. I personally would choose northwestern over brown at the undergrad level regardless of the med school option, although both are great. The schools are pretty equal at the undergrad level. Sure, Brown has the ivy tag but Northwestern has been ranked higher than Brown in every us news ranking for the last 20 years and is trending up - should stay firmly in the Top 10. Brown is usually closer to 14. At the med school level, NU &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Brown. No contest. A top research university (NU) with one of the best research / teaching hospitals in the world compared to an elite undergrad focused school that happens to have a mediocre med school. If your goal is to have the path of least resistance, then Brown will be the easiest option. But, you get nothing for nothing. For medicine, your residency is as important if not more important than your med school. If you slack your way thru Brown with a 3.0 GPA to just meet the mark there, your residency options will be severely limited as they absolutely look at undergrad transcripts as many med schools are P / F these days. I think Northwestern is the happy medium between Harvard and the easy road at Brown. And this doesn’t even account for the fact that Chicago &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Providence in terms of a city. Good luck.

26.<<<JenniferClint>>>
Exactly, that’s why I would go with Brown. The 3.7 requirement is too extreme. Someone who gets into a program like this is undoubtedly capable of meeting it but the whole point of a BS/MD program is to provide an applicant with some certainty. I don’t think you have that if the requirements are so stringent.
Additionally, while NU (Feinberg) is a better med school than Brown (Alpert), medical school prestige doesn’t matter half as much as B-school/law school prestige IMO. I think the student should go to Brown, explore his/her non-medical interests and then begin medical school. The 3 year undergrad at NU could be viewed as a positive but the 4 year Brown degree (with fewer pre-med requirements) will give the student more intellectual freedom.
I would take Harvard over the NU program. If you have to get a 3.7 anyway, you might as well go to Harvard and get as close to a 4.0 as possible. That way you have all your options open in the future.

27.<<<privatebanker>>>
@JenniferClint nails it!

28.<<<Tigerle>>>
If you go with Brown, you can spend a year abroad without having to worry about your GPA at all, and focus entirely on public health in another country. Invaluable insights.

29.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
@JenniferClint
There’s a big gap between 4.0/3.9 and 3.7.  The former allows very little margin; even an A- is a setback.  3.7 GPA at NU is not extreme considering any top-20 med schools these days require close to 3.9 avg GPA, even in science.  Science GPA requirement for HPME is only 3.5. It’s reasonable to predict that if you can’t get 3.7 GPA at NU when NU undergrads already have an average GPA of around 3.5, you will likely struggle at NU med school. It seems to me the requirement serves to confirm the high school record wasn’t a fluke and the candidate has what it takes to handle NU med school. It’s not trying to make life difficult.
NU HPME can do 3yr, 4yr or 3yr + 1 gap year. OP would save a year of tuition if he/she does 3-yr or 3-yr+1 gap year. Also, most probably would prefer spending 7/8 yrs at one of the best Chicago neighborhoods over Providence.

30.<<<RefreshingGel>>>
Although riskier, don’t discount the prestige of a Harvard undergraduate degree in medical school admissions.  According to career advising, 95% of Harvard premeds with a 3.5 gpa or greater are admitted to medical school.

31.<<<ron2learn>>>
Definitely biased here as an incoming freshman at Brown, but I would echo what many have already said on this thread… Take your 4 years of undergrad as an opportunity to explore! You’ll have plenty of long hours studying and doctoring so don’t leave that youthfulness to waste lol. While I was visiting, I definitely remember at least two current students mentioning how they chose Brown over Harvard as pre-meds. Not to mention that Brown’s got a bustling neuroscience departments that is only going to keep growing in the coming years (if you don’t believe me, google for “2018: Revised Operational Plan for Building Brown’s Excellence” and scroll to around page 9). You certainly aren’t tied to Providence forever, but guaranteed med school acceptance is super dope! Even so, I remember an info session claiming that something like 90% of med school applicants got into one of their top 3 choices but my memory could be wrong. Obviously there’s no wrong choice here, just wanted to give another voice for my school… hope to see you in the fall!

32.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@RefreshingGel: “According to career advising, 95% of Harvard premeds with a 3.5 gpa or greater are admitted to medical school.”
Most to med schools worse than NU.
See post #24.

33.<<<confusedcat123>>>
I personally liked Harvard when I visited, but I also feel like it is slightly immature for me to make a decision based on the 48 hours I spent at these three schools.  Question for any students at Harvard (or anyone honestly) - What is the most difficult aspect of being a typical PreMed at a school like Harvard (grades in PreMed classes, preparing for the MCAT, filling out applications, finding/sustaining extracurriculars, etc.)?

34.<<<Mwfan1921>>>
Here is my ranking:

Brown PLME - the least stressful academic environment of the 3 options (doesn’t mean it can’t be stressful tho), No MCAT, open curriculum, semester calendar, med school admission guaranteed with a 3.0. Calling @iwannabe_Brown to add input, including the taking of required med school classes pass/fail

2)Harvard - biggest name, studying mcat while taking classes is challenging, no guarantee of med school acceptance…will need competitive GPA/MCAT combo, go through med school application process which is time consuming and expensive, outcome could be attending med school ranked lower than Brown/NU, pre-health advising is good
3)NU HPME - most stressful (of the 3) academic environment for pre-meds–students are competitive and quarter system adds extra pressures you won’t have in #1 and #2, 3.7 gpa requirement, 3.55 science will be more challenging than Brown requirements
Brown is the clear winner in my mind, with a smaller gap between 1 and 2, and a large gap between 2 and 3.

35.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
@Mwfan1921
The premed courses at NU are taught at the same pace as those in semester schools. They are splitted into 3 parts instead of 2. They are probably no more stressful and competitive than those at Harvard.
Here are the pros for NU:

Higher ranked med school and better location than Brown.  The latter probably means something as it seems OP wants a city with more opportunities.
More medical research than Brown. NU med school has a brand new research center with another 600,000 sq foot of space for research. A lot more research will be brought in than what they already have in the years to come. The research grant is already more than twice the size as Brown.
A year of tuition can be saved. To the extent OP’s family is not rich, this isn’t insignificant.
A gap year (if elected) at the age of ~22 to do something one chooses could be the best time in one’s life. Many wish they could go back in time to do that!

One more thing: HPMEs are waived certain grad requirements (so they can finish their undergraduate portion in 3 years if they want to but don’t have to); it’s close to open curriculum and not really all that different from Brown.

36.<<<momofsenior1>>>
Having just watched a close friend’s daughter go through the med school admission process, take Harvard off your list.    You don’t know what a gift you have with auto admit to med school.
IMO, I would choose Brown.    The freedom to actually enjoy your undergraduate experience without the constant stress and worry over grades is priceless.
I love NU, but the quarter system and the higher GPA threshold will make your courses much faster paced and be more stressful.

37.<<<Mwfan1921>>>
@Iwannahelp  We will have to agree to disagree.
I generally agree that there is more research available at NU, although much of it is at Feinberg, in downtown Chicago, 20-30 minutes from the Evanston campus depending on transport method and time of day.
The fact is the GPA requirement is much more stringent at NU than Brown, and grading likely harder at NU than Brown. NU’s strength of more research doesn’t overcome its disadvantages, IMO. And I love NU, I am an alum who supports the school in many ways, including financially.

38.<<<love2mykiddos>>>
So… my first post here; but thought i had a bit to add from personal perspective.
I went to Brown PLME and LOVED Brown!  Just had wonderful experience. Loved the open curriculum and it really spoke to me. Loved the no pressure of not having to worry about MCAT. Got great financial aid–until med school.  I was totally not prepared for that. Decided i could not swing the cost and had to go back to state school. Which luckily I got in and got scholarship.
Brown 1 hour from Harvard. So very, very, close and went to Boston only occasionally.
Downside: Providence after 4 years was enough!  I was ready for a new ‘scene’ and felt a bit smothered having to stay in PVD for another 3-4 years.
Bring in Northwestern.  I am local; so NWU was NOT a choice for undergrad as I wanted to go, duh, to Brown.
BUT, 7 years/8 years at NWU allows you to experience 2 different environments.  NU quarters will kick your butt.
However, if you choose NU, you at least get to “change” environments. Undergrad in Evanston, Med school Downtown Chicago.
Nix Harvard. Med school waaaay to competitive to 'risk". Either Brown (woo woot) or NU will allow the flexibility of courses to choose if you opt out of Medicine (it’s been known to happen).
Finally, – i don’t remember you mentioning cost. With all due respect, that may be the MOST important.
Which one (Brown vs NU ) is giving you the MOST merit money???
Hope this helps.  
And you are right!!  Great “problem” to have!!!

39.<<<anon145>>>
very likely if you went to NU and had GPA&gt;3.7 you would likely get into another equal or better med school and choose to leave behind the chicago winters.  That’s why I mentioned the Wash U. story (which is not a bad med school) undergrad who stressed himself out to hit the autoadmit GPA but went to a better med school anyway.  The only single reason not to pick brown is that even doing study abroad you would not be able to be in providence that long.
As far as matching for residency that’s a standard exam all second year med students take that determines your match.  And FYI doctor of osteopathy will be taking the same exam soon so kids going to DO schools won’t be as stigmatized.

40.<<<gpo613>>>
Brown is the way to go.
For me the med certainty is huge.  NU’s GPA requirement is tough.
Go to Brown take the extra year take classes you really are interested in taking and become a well-rounded individual.
To me freedom is priceless.

Harvard has a pre-med committee which writes committee letters (commonly understood to be required for pre-meds attending colleges where this is done).  Presumably, the pre-med committee will advise pre-meds with poor chances of admission that it is not worth applying, a common way that colleges with pre-med committees have high medical school admission rates.

Where are all the comments about “rampant grade inflation” at Brown coming from?   My kid at Brown is saying that class averages in her science and math classes are in the mid 70s (she’s doing great, so no incentive to hype up that others are doing poorly).
All this talk about how easy Brown is, is very misleading.   If you go there, you will be working good and plenty on your coursework.   Classes aren’t easy.  You won’t be intellectually superior to your classmates.  You will be among your peers, who are all incredibly interesting and are all engaged in their education.   No one is taking any classes they don’t want to, unless it’s required as a part of something that they want to study, so they know they Need the info in that class.
I don’t think there’s grade inflation.  If Brown kids have a higher GPA, I think it’s a function of 2 things.  I think the most important is that they are invested in their classes.  The other is that it is easy to manage their GPA.  This can be done by sitting in on multiple classes during shopping period so you can see if you click with the Prof and the materials before committing to it.  Another is you can use the P/F option to avoid bad grades, but you have to exercise that option early on in the semester.  Finally, you can withdraw from a class very late in the semester.  But other than shopping period, you’re going to not want to use the other options much.

[/quote]

All of the above.
For example, when choosing courses at Harvard or Northwestern, you will be chasing grades (any grade lower than A- will be bad).  You may encounter dilemmas similar to what the student in this thread is facing:
https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-life/2139155-should-i-take-honors-versions-of-courses-that-im-really-interested-in-if-im-pre-md-phd.html
In comparison, at Brown, you are much more free to enjoy your academic experience without feeling that you have to grade-grub.
Of course, preparing for the MCAT is time consuming, and many pre-meds spend significant amounts of money as well.
Obviously, there are expected pre-med extracurriculars (although you should be doing them even if you are in an express program like at Brown or Northwestern).
In terms of doing applications, most pre-meds apply to 15-30 medical schools hoping for one admission (most applicants get zero admissions).  With one medical school admission (most who get admitted get only one), you take it or leave it, with no choice between medical schools based on cost, ranking (which is not all that important in medicine, as opposed to law or business), or anything else.  Applications also involve short notice travel to medical school interviews, which can be a substantial cost in time and money.

44.<<<anon145>>>
@melvin123   U. of chicago’s average GPA of accepted med students is 3.64
https://careeradvancement.uchicago.edu/uchicago-careers-in/health-professions/pre-health-faqs
can’t find the link but the average GPA of kids accepted from Brown (outside of plme) was a 3.8.     this implies med school admissions committee recognize these differences.   (I’m not a chicago fan, but it’s well known schools like chicago and carnegie mellon are grade deflationary - which is not the same as “easy” or “hard” necessarily.
and I never heard of what Banker said above, but Organic Chemistry is THE weed out class for premed so if you can take that pass fail why wouldn’t you?   99% of doctors could not possibly draw the chair conformation of glucose if you asked them to.  (which was like 2 weeks of O chem if I remember correctly.)

[/quote]

Class averages on assigments/tests mean absolutely nothing; it’s the final semester grades that matter.  (If half of those 70’s were A’s…)
I realize that Brownies gets a little sensitive about this, but Brown has the highest mean GPA of any college.  (Yale and Pomona are also up there.)  And what that means is that Brown courses, including premed courses, are graded on an A-/B+ curve, mostly the former.  Yes, anyone who may be in the C range will quickly change to P/F.
But that is the point about the guaranteed admission program:  a premed in this program can take Orgo and be happy with a Pass.  All of a sudden you have many of your top kids (PLME students) gunning for a C- in the most important science course for premeds.  At no other school is that possible.   And by removing some the PLME P/F students from competing for the A’s, life has to get better for those towards the ‘bottom’ of the class.
No one is saying the kids at Brown don’t work hard.   Its just that those on the margin, say a B+ and NU, would more likely earn an A- for the same work effort due to Brown’s more generous grading policy.

46.<<<bluebayou>>>
P.S.  I tried to get both of my kids to apply to Brown, but one liked another school much better and the other kid was turned off by the tour guide who was a SJW and that’s all we heard about for an hour.

47.<<<mdphd92>>>
In addition to the excellent advice you have received so far, here are some other considerations.  First, you didn’t say what state you are from.  That is critical, because most premeds, even those from Harvard, end up at their state medical schools.  Some states have fewer and some have more applicants per available spot, so your chances depend somewhat on what state you live in.  Also, you can refer to your state medical school(s) as the most likely comparison with Northwestern or Brown medical schools.
Second, one possibility is for you to enter the Northwestern or Brown programs and then see how you do in Organic Chemistry and on the MCATs.  If you are a very strong applicant, you might be able to drop out of the M.D. part of the program and apply as a regular applicant to medical schools.  I know someone who did this from the Brown program.  I also know someone who was in the BS/MD program at Michigan (which no longer exists), then transferred to another undergraduate institution, then applied as a regular premed, and then attended a top medical school.
Third, you need to assess how risk-prone or risk-averse you are.  This is a classic problem in decision analysis, where you are comparing a safe alternative (Northwestern or Brown) versus a riskier one that has a potentially better outcome (Harvard plus a top medical school), bad outcome (Harvard plus no medical school), or something in between (Harvard plus a medical school you like less than Northwestern or Brown).  You should assign utility values to each of these outcomes, and if possible probability values, to help you decide.

48.<<<truthquest>>>
Wow, it hard to give someone so accomplished and thoughtful “advice”.  First of all, it is unlikely that someone with your credentials and clear focus on preparation will not get into med school.  I don’t care what the admission rates are right now.  You are getting into med school.
But YOUR quality of life and enjoyment of the next 8 years is important and you know yourself… do you stress easily about grades, will you be miserable with the med school application game always on your mind?   If so, go to a combined program, BUT remember, at least with Brown, you can go to an arguably better undergraduate school  than NW (both are great of course) and if you knock it out of the park there you can still apply to a different med school from Brown, including Harvard’s… i.e. take the MCAT anyway …
The two med schools that you got into are awesome but not the top ones in the country…yes NW is higher ranked… but I have to say, you seem off the charts special…as a scholar… and might be someone that could go to H med school some day or Penn or JHU etc… .
If you are determined to be a doctor and want to have the least stressful 8 years of the three options, then Brown, for sure, is your best option.  You not only don’t have to take the MCATS but your gpa requirements are minimal as compared to NW and you can take some other courses p/f.  AND you can still take the MCAT if you wish and apply to Harvard, Penn, JHU, Wash U… too anyway… (it is a possibility).
My guess is that nobody is telling you much that you don’t already know… All roads lead to great success…
My prediction…very few people turn down Harvard… we will see you in the square?
Congratulations

49.<<<truthquest>>>
Just re-read your description.  I recently thought I read Brown’s description and you could apply out BUT you lose med school Brown acceptance … but you can apply out… I think…

@truthquest:
“but I have to say, you seem off the charts special…as a scholar… and might be someone that could go to H med school some day or Penn or JHU etc… .”
The vast majority of Harvard undergrad pre-meds who even get in to med school don’t even get in to a med school at NU’s level.  NU Feinberg isn’t (just to pick med school #93 of the 185 ranked by US News) Central Michigan med school. And Harvard undergrad pre-meds aren’t exactly those who fell off the turnip truck.  Pretty much by definition, Harvard undergrads are “off the chart special”, and look how many of them get to even a med school at Feinberg’s level, much less the very tippy-top med schools.

51.<<<Publisher>>>
Clearly between Northwestern & Brown.
Northwestern’s “can apply out” versus Brown’s  “cannot apply out” should put an end to the debate in favor of Northwestern HPME.
Brown is NOT helping you with a 3.0 GPA requirement. Plus, if that was important to you, you would not have any of these three outstanding options available to you.
Northwestern’s GPA requirement has been misstated throughout this thread other than in the post starting this thread. Although I am a bit confused as Northwestern requires a hybrid GPA of 3.7 “regular” (???) and a 3.55 GPA in science courses. (Question: Does that mean an overall 3.7 GPA is required or that something in between the 3.55 science requirement & the 3.7 non-science (or is it overall ?) requirement ?)
Northwestern’s requirement are asking you to do the best that you can do while alleviating the stress of the MCAT & of a fourth year of undergrad (complete undergrad & med school in 7 years instead of 8 years). Requiring you to maintain your academic prowess helps you if your plans change. And plans do change. You may do so well that you take the MCAT & decide to apply to the medical schools at Harvard, Stanford, Johns Hopkins, UC-San Francisco, Penn & Columbia in addition to #17 Northwestern’s Feinberg.
Brown’s low GPA requirement locks you into Brown’s medical school.
By expecting you to maintain a high GPA, Northwestern is doing you a favor; allowing you to slack off is not.

52.<<<jzducol>>>
@Confusedcat Congrats on these great acceptances!  OP being so accomplished probably does not need advice from average strangers like us.
I would agree with almost everyone who had chimed in about BSMD at NU or Brown being the easiest path to an MD, which most kids at this stage of life can only dream about.  But OP did not seem to fit the stereotype of someone who just want to be a doctor as the ultimate goal.  She/he wants to be a leader in medical fields and beyond, perhaps help to shape economic policy in healthcare. I think such ambitions have best chance to be realized thru Harvard than elsewhere.  OP seemed to like what Harvard had to offer for his/her interests too.  I don’t know much about the BSMD at NU or Brown, but as a Harvard parent I can offer some anecdotal evidence why opportunities for OP may be more available at Harvard College.  My kid’s roommate happened to be a premed.  Besides the wonderful premed support she gets from the College, she attended a seminar taught by a prominent healthcare economist who was an architect in Obamacare.  I can only imagine what a dream class it would be for someone like OP, sitting in with eleven other kids to learn how nation’s healthcare policies were actually made.  My kid is taking a small econ class this semester taught by a professor who was involved in creating trade policies in the Bush White House.  There are probably no better places to pursue interests in public policy than at Harvard.
But more importantly if OP’s ultimate goal is MD at an ultra elite like HMS, residence at Mass Gen etc, being a thought leader in medicine, engaged in healthcare polices, the Harvard College route makes it more plausible even though it will involve more work.
There is plenty of evidence to suggest that when it comes elite professional schools and grad programs Harvard degree will give you a leg up.
http://collegematchus.com/ranking-the-colleges-top-colleges-that-feed-alumni-into-grad-school-programs/
On the other hand, if OP is content with being an MD, he/she has pretty much reached the goal at such a young age and OP can indeed cruise a little bit in the next four years.  In that case choosing NU/Brown makes more sense.

53.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
^ “On the other hand, if OP is content with being an MD from a top 20 medical school”
Fixed for you.
@jzducol:  Again, the vast majority of Harvard pre-meds don’t even manage to get in to a med school at NU Feinberg’s level.
That ranking you listed would be dominated by MBA’s and JD’s simply due to the difference in size of incoming class of top med/law/b-schools.
HBS takes in near 1000 every year.
HLS offered 968.
Harvard Med School took in 165.

54.<<<jzducol>>>
“the vast majority of Harvard pre-meds don’t even manage to get in to a med school at NU Feinberg’s level”
Do you have data for that?

55.<<<confusedcat123>>>
@mdphd92 Thank you for the advice. I am from a state that has 4 MD programs (two private, two public). Of these, one private is typically in Top 15 (3% acceptance), one public in Top 25 (4% acceptance), the other private in Top 50 (3% acceptance), and the other public in the top 100 (13% acceptance) - you can probably guess what state I’m from now, haha. Honestly, I would be really super ecstatic to gain an acceptance into any of the first three of these schools, if I were to choose to go the traditional route.
Although I must admit that I have looked at rankings and such, I am not one to really base my ultimate decision on them. Particulary with Medical School, I feel like it is so standardized and the STEP1 Exam seems to matter more so that it really is more about the location, culture, and specific research interests than it is about the #19 school vs. #35 school. And when I think about this, I also think,  “well, in that case, I should probably pick Harvard anyways, since I really love the school and if getting into a top 5/10/20 med school is not my priority, I should be fine as I ought to be able to get into a top 60ish school with a Harvard degree”. Also, the thought of essentially committing to one location for 7/8 years seems like a gamble.
Additionally, I feel like BS/MD kind of are like “shortcuts” to the process. If, as a doctor, I am ready to take a full life of preparation, stress (which I should learn to be able to take the positive way), and standardized testing, then what good does a guaranteed program do for me? Yes, I will be able to relax for 3/4 years, but if that is really what I want to do, should I even be interested in being a doctor?
But then again, I also realize that being a PreMed is HARD, to the point where so many opt out of considering Med School. Also, I know that many of these private schools REALLY try to weed out PreMeds as they want their applied to med school/accepted to med school ratio to be really high (versus a school that is relatively more manageable in terms of PreMed academics and a lot more students graduate with the PreMed requirements complete). Also, the other way to look at the argument is that, since I will be having a full life of stress, this may be a good time to kind of relax and focus on personal development and enrichment.
Ugghh this is SO hard haha!

56.<<<confusedcat123>>>

@Publisher You make really good points! As for the Northwestern GPA requirement, they want the students to maintain an overall GPA of 3.7 (so average among science and non-science) and a science GPA of 3.55 (so average among science classes will be a mix of A’s and B’s).

Why would applying out be that much of an advantage for a student who retains eligibility for the express medical school program?
Northwestern’s HPME GPA requirement of 3.7 overall and 3.55 science are listed in https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/hpme/faq/index.html .
Brown’s PLME academic requirements are given at https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/plme/sites/brown.edu.academics.medical.plme/files/uploads/PLME_Handbook_Class_of_2017.pdf .  It is not as simple as a 3.0 GPA.  For required biology courses, the student must earn an A or B grade.  Otherwise, GPA is not calculated, but there may be some subjective evaluation of the student’s progress (section V).  Internal grades are recorded and considered for courses taken S/NC.
But, in any case, a Northwestern HPME student will be chasing grades when selecting courses, possibly deterring academic exploration and otherwise making more fulfilling academic choices as an undergraduate.  If Brown PLME requirements (which the OP should follow up on to see what the subjective evaluation tends to entail) are less stringent, the OP would be more free to choose a more fulfilling undergraduate experience, instead of chasing grades.

59.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@jzducol, look at post #24 by @StanfordGSB00.
2 out of 10+ Harvard pre-meds he knew got in to a top 20 med school.
Yes, it’s anecdotal, but pretty believable that those are roughly the true odds. Med schools have tiny intakes. Top 20 out of 185 med schools ranked by USNews. They all have acceptance rates in the low single digits and after all the weeding out during undergrad, pre-med applicants would be a stronger group than the HYPSM HS applicant pool, IMO.
So it seems plausible to me that NU Feinberg would reject the average Harvard pre-med undergrad.

60.<<<jzducol>>>
^ @PurpleTitan  How did someone’s original
" I personally know of 10 plus students who went to HYP and did the premed track. They all ended up at fine med schools but only 2 went to a top 20 med school. "
become  “2 out of 10+ Harvard pre-meds he knew got in to a top 20 med school.”  ?
Regardless, I got your point.  But that’s just your opinion though, based on someone else’s opinion, not data.

61.<<<RefreshingGel>>>
@PurpleTitan
“Most to med schools worse than NU.”
You have to compare apples to apples.  Since the minimum HPME GPA requirement is 3.7, you should compare Harvard undergraduates with a GPA 3.7 or greater.  I would venture many are accepted to T20 medical schools comparable to Northwestern and more than a few to top 10 medical schools including Harvard Medical School.

62.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
@jzducol
Princeton had their stats published. No, most of them don’t get into top-20 although ~90% did get in somewhere. Can’t imagine Harvard somehow magically has a vastly different outcome. I remember seeing schools like Cornell and UChicago has their rate of around high 70s%. That’s just getting into somewhere, let alone top-20. There’s no reason to believe Harvard grads somehow would do way better.

63.<<<IWannaHelp>>>
@RefreshingGel
Well, it’s not that simple. NU requirement is light in the sense that while overall requirement is 3.7, the science GPA is 3.5.  With the grade inflation in schools outside of engineering, 3.7 is rather easy for anyone that is Harvard material (assuming it’s not a fluke).  3.5 in sciences is probably harder but that’s nothing compared to the 3.88 science GPA that people at NU med school had (class of 2022).
Also, getting into a top-20 med school isn’t just about grades. It’s also about extracurricular, MCAT, and recommendations. You won’t need to worry about those as a HPME. That means more time for interests and hobbies or just time available to make sure the grades are there.

64.<<<EverAfter>>>
For whatever it’s worth: I was a pre-vet at Brown in the mid 90s.  I followed the pre-med curriculum and spent a lot of time with pre-meds.  I struggled with a few of the physical science classes–as in, almost didn’t pass one of them and had to take a summer class.  I felt like I was a typical type-A, stressed-out, hard-working student.  I also had stressed (brilliant) PLME roommates and friends who worked most of the time, despite the security of their guaranteed acceptances into medical school.
However, once I got to vet school, the horror stories I heard from my classmates about competitiveness and backstabbing at other undergraduate schools were shocking to me.  This dynamic was not a single part of my experience mingling with med students at Brown–perhaps due to the PLME program and open curriculum.
Looking back, I was extremely well-prepared for vet school.  I also remember with fondness my classes at Brown in Egyptology and Arthurian legends–among others. 
But take all of this with a grain of salt.  My information is old and I have little insider knowledge of Harvard or NU…except that Evanston is GORGEOUS in the summer.

If health economics or health policy is your ultimate goal, then a Harvard degree will open far more doors for you.
The MD degree will just be icing on the cake. If you want to practice medicine then no one will care where you went to school. So the extra boost from top 20 vs top 40 medical school is meaningless. The thing that matters for residency placement is USMLE Step 1 scores. This is far and away the # 1 thing that residency directors look for. The prestige of the school is much much farther down the list. (Source: Bryan Carmody - see his tweets). Not allowed to link here, sorry.
Now the schools with the highest MCAT scores tend to also have the highest USMLE scores – because they enroll students who are good at taking tests. The first year of medical school is almost like learning an entirely different language. The reason why Organic chemistry is used as a weed out class is because it mimics the volume of material that is taught in med school. If you can memorize hundreds of orgo equations, then memorizing the names of each branch of the aorta should be easy. Med school is not difficult, but requires the ability to assimilate lots of material, and recognize patterns across massive amounts of data.

67.<<<brantly>>>
One piece of advice I have not seen here yet:  Talk to at least four or five students who just went through the medical school admissions process during this last cycle.  Ask them how the process was for them.  Ask them if they, with 20/20 hindsight, would have taken guaranteed admission if it had been offered, or if the MCAT/application/interview process was no big deal.

68.<<<jzducol>>>
^Unless you can find ten students like OP who were cross-admits at both H and BSMD, and five of them chose one option vs the other, you are not going to find a valid data set. And even if you can find them the survey results would be full of confirmation bias.

Well, the most influential health economist of the past few decades, Victor Fuchs, went to NYU undergrad.

I didn’t say he should talk to people who had the exact options that he has.

But that’s not comparing apples to apples.  For someone in HPME to get in to Feinberg, they only has to meet the GPA requirements (3.7 overall GPA; 3.55 science GPA).  To get in as a Harvard undergrad, you need a high GPA, good MCAT score (lots of studying for that too), all the EC/volunteering stuff, and then you get to stress out about whether you’d get in anywhere.

To the extent that locations matter, NU med school is located at one of the best locations in Chicago and many NU med students stay there for their residency. That’s after 3-4 yrs of undergrad at the lovely Evanston campus. The two different locations for ug and med provide a nice change for the transition.
I don’t believe Harvard necessarily opens more door. My guess is none of the people who claim otherwise actually works in health policy. The whole premed journey could eat up so much of one’s time that he/she may not have much left to pursue his/her interests.

Pick the school you liked the best, not based on GPA, promises of MD programs, or other nonsense.
You really don’t know if you can go to medical school, until you spend more time with patients and
more time in a lab, if MD/PhD might be in your future.  The MD programs will totally misdirect you,
and NOT in your favor.  You are bright and need to explore.
If you are meant to get an MD, you will get there.  why commit now? This is your time to explore.
Try clinical work before you commit to an MD.   Try lab work. Try an internship in public policy in Washington DC.
From Harvard, you can get them all, but other two are fine too.
I would look carefully at PhD programs in health policy if you believe policy is a good direction for you.
Its OK to be a doctor for a while, but chances are, if you really want to work in policy, you may not like clinical medicine.
See these graduate programs. They fit your interests better than slicing up a cadaver I bet!

You are not rejecting Harvard for an undergrad at an unknown state school in Shreveport or a low ranked med school in Lubbock.
You have nothing to loose, it’s all good and just a matter of finding less stress and better fit. Brown seems like an ideal option to me unless you prefer NU.

My son was going through a similar process - trying to decide between HYPS and Brown PLME. His direction was a little different from yours. He decided PLME. However, because we have had a few conversations about this decision, I thought that I would share my thoughts.
The Brown PLME program seems to “free you up” to actually pursue whatever you want in undergrad without having to deal with the stress of the “premed grind” and studying for MCATs. Sure, there are some requirements—but relatively easy to fulfill given the “open” curriculum.
For you, this can mean focusing on public policy:
https://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/plcy/
Also, as a PLME, you could take a year to get an advanced degree or take an internship: https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/plme/current-students/enrichment-activities/advanced-scholarship
If are particularly interested in public policy type of work, you have an opportunity as a PLME to apply to a combined program:
Masters in Public Affairs.
https://www.brown.edu/academics/medical/education-programs/mdmpa-program/mdmpa-program-admissions
https://watson.brown.edu/mpa/apply/md-mpa
I am not as familiar with HPME. However, I did have a colleague who went through the program, and he was a faculty member with me at a top medical school. He was successfully (i.e. grant-funded) engaged in clinical and bench research. I also have a few friends who went to Harvard undergrad and got accepted to well respected medical schools and are all successful.
So ultimately, any of your current options are extremely viable. I suspect that you will do well regardless of the path that you take—just recognize that some of the paths may be much more challenging than others.

81.<<<truthquest>>>
Your choices are the equivalent of a kid in a candy shop.   You do not really need an easier route because you are going to prepare for your craft no matter what – that is why Brown softens the requirements …because it knows you don’t need motivation to properly prepare your career. HOWEVER, just because you are good with dealing with stress does not mean that you should be ok with it.  Stress at low levels are ok, but with big ticket stressors like what your org chem grade is going to be or —you have to get an A in x class to keep a 3.7 gpa for the quarter… is arbitrary pressure that will not make you a better doctor.  It really is about knowing yourself and quality of life and for that reason… none of us can ultimately move the needle for you.  Love to hear about what you decided.

82.<<<stud3nt10>>>
@confusedcat123
A BS/MD program shouldn’t be seen as a “shortcut”. I understand that taking the MCAT and standardized exams overall provides good experience especially in terms of self-studying, managing multiple things, stress and finding your individual method to efficiency. However, the time that you would spend studying and agonizing over the MCAT, you could spend doing other classes (relevant to your other interests), research or clinical work, also important as you continue your med journey.
By the way, would you mind giving your stats?

“The single greatest gift she has ever received in college is taking orgo pass fail”
That’s a little odd, that’s a class you want to take for a grade so you challenge yourself.  I’ve brought this up before, do you really want a civil engineer to take a structural mechanics course (or whatever is the weed out course), barely pass, and build a bridge?
“Brown is NOT helping you with a 3.0 GPA requirement.”
I would agree with this, one of my good friends went to Brown undergrad back in the day for pre-med and he said med schools want to see the grades of all your classes, so p/f was not an option for him.  I would slightly lean to NU because it’s a better med school and you get to switch campuses at med school, so it’s not the same scene for 7 or 8 years, as someone mentioned above.

84.<<<privatebanker>>>
Oh come on @theloniusmonk .
Your telling us you don’t get the difference between working hard/challenging yourself and life or death stress?  She actually did great.  Because she had the ability to relax and learn the material.  These types of students don’t mail it in.

85.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@theloniusmonk, how much material in orgo does any working doctor need to know or remember?
Orgo is used as a weedout class because med school classes, like orgo, require memorizing a lot of material in a short period of time.

86.<<<theloniusmonk>>>
They may not mail it in, but they can mail it in, the combination of pass/fail, 3.0, guaranteed med school means you can do not so good in science classes, well in the others and you’re in med school.  Ancedotally  my friend at Brown, went to Hopkins, so from my vantage, it’s great for pre-med if it gets you into the best med school!  Pre-med should not be cut-throat but it should be competitive, not relaxing.

Not quite.  Gen Chem is where you can get away with just memorizing stuff, and a few formulas.
Organic is a class that requires visualization and critical thinking/reasoning skills in addition to memorization, but the hard part is how to apply those memorized facts.  That is why the ‘C’ students who stick it out can do much better second term once they ‘get it’.  What they they really ‘get’ is much better visualization and critical thinking skills.

Providence is a much better than take than Cambridge. And I love Cambridge.  Cambridge has gotten a bit sketchy.  Providence is the foodie capital and totally hip arts scene. The ocean and med tech hub.  College hill is tree lined and super clean and fun. All students and risd too.
Where do people get their information?

Agree. Evanston is a beautiful upscale community along the shores of Lake Michigan.
Tufts Medical School is ranked at #50 (along with UMass-Worcester) and for Primary Care is ranked at #55 (along with Hofstra, Eastern Virginia, Missouri & Mount Sinai).
Regardless, all grads are still called doctor.
Just a bit surprising for one who is committed to medical school to turn down two amazing opportunities.

Also Alpert medical school has.  Brand new buildings on the bay, brand new student apartments the Wexford innovation zone and billion dollar med tech and science incubator zone. The whole new med and science zone is exploding. Wonderful place for a young person. Providence is in the downtown and college hill zone is one of the best places in the world to be a student right now. And the influence of the world class culinary school at Johnson and Wales can be felt city wide.
And a quick trip to Newport and the world renowned beaches in 45 minutes.
Really.  I get the Harvard thing but the location.  No way. Harvard is like going to school at college Disneyland if you like tourists.

@confusedcat123 Congrats! You chose a harder road towards an MD, but it will be potentially more rewarding. Explore all the wonderful opportunities Harvard has to offer, make great lifelong friends and enjoy those four incredible years!

“Really. I get the Harvard thing but the location. No way. Harvard is like going to school at college Disneyland if you like tourists.”
My kid’s dorm is a few steps from Harvard statue, the most visited spot on campus.  Out of hundreds of phone calls and messages I have never heard once she complained about there being too many tourists.  I guess one gets used to it quickly.
But you do see all kinds of visitors on campus.  Two days ago I got a text from my DD saying Bill Clinton just walked by.  And there are sightings of Obamas and John Roberts as they are all parents there.  Visitors and tourists can keep things interesting.

Not saying it isn’t interesting or great in its own way.  But a poster compared it to Providence as though superior. Some might like the tour busses and people touching Harvard’s foot for good luck all day. Some not so much.
FWIW.
On the brown on campus in the past few years I’ve seen Sting, had lunch next to Larry David at Andreas, stood in line at the bookstore next Steven Spielberg, saw Emma Watson a load of times and jack Nicholson at city sports  and Phil Michelson several times. They all chose brown and providence for their children among their many choices  It’s not unique to Harvard.
