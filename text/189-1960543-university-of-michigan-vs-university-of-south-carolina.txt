Hi everyone! I have gotten to the point where I have received decisions from everywhere I have applied, and have to start thinking about making a decision. My top two at this point are the University of Michigan and the University of South Carolina. Cost for both are very similar for me, so that will not play a role in my decision at this point. I am planning on majoring in something related to business. At South Carolina, I really like the international business program. For Michigan, I have applied to Ross. I am having trouble picking between the two schools. Michigan is instate for me and I live about 20 minutes away, and I do not like that it is that close to home. I do recognize, however, that it is a terrific school. I fell in love with South Carolina’s campus and the idea of attending when I visited, but I do know that it is not ranked as highly as Michigan overall (but it does have a great business program). I am having a tough time coming to a conclusion (I know I have plenty of time), but I would appreciate the thoughts of others on this. Thanks!

2.<<<my2caligirls>>>
If you get into Ross UM is a better option but I can see why going to school in your back yard may not be a great adventure. Live on campus and treat it like you are far away. Good luck.

3.<<<1917souci>>>
The University of South Carolina Darla Moore International School of Business is rated number one by all accounts. It is NOT an easy school to get into. Having said that, my best friend son graduated from this school last year. He did an internship at Google in Ann Arbor (yes Google is in Ann Arbor) and was offered employment once he graduated. He was super driven and he did a few abroad studies in Spain, Denmark, and I believe even in Brazil.  The school  IB department is fabulous and competitive.  Having said that, his only REGRET was that he did not go to a higher ranked or overall better named school . The overall Business School is good but not like the IB department and not as selective.    At the time he was applying to colleges,USC was the most affordable option and that is where he ended up going. He knows that the fact that he graduated for USC did NOT affect internship or job opportunities. He has done quite well for a 23 year old.
Overall Michigan is the better school. The IB department might be very good as well.  Both schools have a lot of spirit. but the student bodies are much much different.   If weather is an issue, you know your answer. USC is also much generous with their OOS scholarships than Michigan, but this might not be an issue for you. Based on his experience, he excelled at USC but for whatever reason, he only has that one regret.

4.<<<VAMom23>>>
Name has value to those who value it. There are some doors that may be open from attending a bigger named school. If you think you may go to grad school that is the na,e that will ultimately really matter.
You need to make the best of the opportunities that are available  U SC has highly ranked programs and a very strong reputation on the East coast. In Michigan, name recognition won’t be as high. You need to be happy where ever you wind up. It’s a really important and fun time of your life. But 10 years down the road people are goi g to care about what you have done, and less about where you went to school. Visit both campuses. Talk to professors and students. Get to know the people. Good luck. My son is in a similar predicament this year.

5.<<<mclmom>>>
Michigan is much better recognized.  Throughout much of the country there is still much bias against “southern” schools.  If you plan to work in California, the Midwest, the Northeast - go Michigan is my advice.

6.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
There are legitimate reasons to choose University of South Carolina for you.  If South Carolina will make you happier and more excited for college, it is perhaps the better choice.
However, posters saying that Michigan will have less name recognition than South Carolina are either very clueless or lying.  Non-Ross and Ross UMich will both afford far greater name recognition and career opportunities than South Carolina Business, ceteris paribus.
BTW, when most people say “USC”, they mean University of Southern California, not University of South Carolina.

7.<<<rickle1>>>
Michigan has been considered an elite state school for many many years. On par with UVA, UCB, UNC-CH. That doesn’t mean it’s actual specific program of interest is better than S. Carolina (ditto on the USC = Univ. of SoCal - everywhere other than perhaps S. Carolina). It does mean, however, its reputation will carry nationally. Another poster brought up a good point. Where do you want to live post college? It will be easier with a degree from Michigan. Not that it can’t be done otherwise, just easier (better on campus recruiting, deeper alumni reach). If you choose SC, you may just have to be more creative in securing those internships and first job. After that, where you go will have little importance compared to what you do.

8.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this conversation. I am aware that Michigan’s overall reputation is better. Both of my parents went to Umich, my sister is there now, and I live about 20 minutes away from campus so I have grown up with it. During my college search, I have been completely against Michigan because I have really wanted to get away and do something different than my family. I found USC (yes I do call it that) when looking at international business as they have the top school for that major. I have visited USC and loved it. Another big draw to the school was the scholarships, and I have received instate tuition at least as of now. I feel as though I will have regrets either way. USC has been my top school for the last year and a half. I love the campus, the city, the IB major, and the school spirit. That being said, I feel as though I will regret not attending Umich because of the rankings and job opportunities that can come from it. Ann Arbor is also a very cool place, but it’s close to home for me and I want to branch out.

9.<<<1917souci>>>
It is very difficult to bypass U Michigan if you are able to get in and you are able to pay the lower In State tuition. So many people would love to be in your position, especially all those OOS applicants either willing to pay the steep $48K tuition or the ones that do not apply because they can not make that kind of payment…
South Carolina is a very fine school, especially the IB department. However, ROSS is ELITE and so is Michigan when it comes to public universities. I can see you choosing UNC , UF, and Texas over Michigan due to say weather and wanting to go away. As I mentioned before, my friend’s son was able to do so well at USC that he even got an internship and a job at Google. Assuming he moves on from Google to another job, that might be the only thing that matters. USC would be a fine choice.

10.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
And I will note that I have been accepted to both, and USC will be a few thousand dollars cheaper at this point.

11.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
@pbmcdoug
Is that including travel costs?

12.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@yikesyikesyikes Well right now, Michigan is around 29k and USC is about 24k. I should get a few thousand more from USC getting it to around 21k. That does not include travel costs, but I do know that I will often travel by car (besides winter break) to get to USC.

13.<<<1917souci>>>
By the end of the day, you are the only one who can make this decision. But for a few thousand dollars MORE  ( are we taking $2000, $5000, or $20,000?)  , I take the University of Michigan any day… This is coming from someone was accepted and is strongly considering The Ohio State University :))

14.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@1917souci USC could offer anywhere from $2000 to $8000 more making it between $16,000-$22,000 per year. Michigan would be $29,000. I applied to Osu too… yikes

15.<<<1917souci>>>
No no yikes…All good here. LOL!  Based on your initial posting, it does not sound like you have heard from Ross yet so technically you are still in the waiting mode. Same with the complete financial numbers from USC. You probably should wait and see once you have a complete picture. If your COA at USC is close to to $16K, then that would be very close to full Tuition… and full Tuition is just an awesome place to be at one of the top IB schools in the country.

16.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@1917souci yeah I am definitely going to wait because I am waiting to hear from Ross and USC honors/capstone

17.<<<1917souci>>>
Good luck to you…Oh one more thing. At UM you might be a small fish in a big frozen pond, but at USC, you might end up being a big fish in a small warm pond and closer to the beautiful city of Charleston and the beaches…

18.<<<rickle1>>>
Clearly you can do well from either place. As parents posting on this site, we typically take the perspective of wanting the best for our kids. Objectively, that would lean heavily towards UM. That said, there is nothing objective about the college admissions process. So much of it comes down to not best, but rather, best for you. Only you can determine that. We look at rankings, history, reputation, etc. and it seems like a slam dunk. We, however, haven’t walked in your shoes. You need to decide what feels better. I’m sure you’ll consider all relevant data and make a great choice. Good luck and all the best!

19.<<<SwimmingDad>>>
From a pure opportunity standpoint, it’s not even close.  U of Michigan is a top ranked university and Ross is one of the top ranked undergrad business programs in the U.S.  U of South Carolina is way, way down the food chain.  It is risky to go to a school that is middle of the road but had a single well ranked program.  Even more risky is to go to a school that you won’t be happy at and a culture in which you won’t thrive.  And only you can make that choice.

20.<<<TTG>>>
We know someone who attended a South Carolina university in recent years. Her fellow students nicknamed her “Yankee Girl.” She was born and raised in Virginia, which is home to Richmond, the Confederate capital.

21.<<<TooOld4School>>>
I think you have a solid plan, wait for the final word on admission to the honors college at USC and to Ross. You can then evaluate the total difference in price. Keep in mind that going away also has some downsides- you won’t be able to go home for the weekend if you need to de-stress from your crazy roommate or if you are sick, travel is a lot more expensive (you’ll probably fly for Thanksgiving break, at least), and you’ll miss family events. Also consider the following:
Is your OOS scholarship guaranteed? Do you have to maintain a certain GPA? What if you need a 5th year?
What is the cost of study abroad? Do you pay your current tuition or some different amount? What are the reciprocal schools?
If you change your mind and switch majors, what is the effect on cost, graduation, etc.?
What are the most common firms hiring from the program, starting salary, etc. etc. ?

22.<<<gamecockmom>>>
You might want to wait until you can compare “apples to apples”- honors college acceptance and International Business acceptance at USC (I agree with using that acronym! Lol!) would make a huge difference to your experience on campus.
Good luck with your decision!

23.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
And while UMich may be close to home, see if you can do study-abroad to get away for a few semesters.
Remember that this is a 40 year decision, not a 4 year decision (yes, after you graduate, few people will care where you went . . . except for alumni and the friends you made, but that may matter).

24.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
(deleted double post)

25.<<<tk21769>>>
Have you thought about where you’d like to live and work after you graduate?
Would you rather settle down, maybe get married, and have a career in South Carolina, or in Michigan?
You’re not locked into either region, regardless, but school ties may tilt your advantages toward one or the other.

26.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
“You’re not locked into either region, regardless, but school ties may tilt your advantages toward one or the other.”
Except one degree definitely “travels” better than the other one.

27.<<<ThinkOn>>>
And that one would be Michigan. Another vote for Michigan here.

28.<<<brantly>>>
You haven’t even been admitted to Ross yet. There’s no decision to make. Would you even consider Michigan if you don’t get in to Ross?

29.<<<Mom2aphysicsgeek>>>
@brantly’s point is equally true for USC.  If you have not been accepted into the HC, then you have not been accepted as pre-IB. (You aren’t even accepted directly into IB.  I think if your GPA drops below a 3.5, IB as a jr is no longer an option.) The IB program is incredibly competitive.  If you aren’t admitted as an incoming freshman, the admissions is fierce and requires a minimum of a 3.6 or 3.7 to even apply.  (I can’t remember exactly.  I sat in on a presentation last yr and the details are fuzzy.  Since it didn’t apply to my dd, it wasn’t a focus.)
To give you an idea, my dd is a Top Scholar who was accepted into pre-IB bc of the HC admissions.  She is also part of one of their cohort students.  She only has until Feb of this yr (freshman) to decide if she wants to stay in the cohort or switch to classic IB.  If she changes her mind March or later that she doesn’t want to be in her cohort, she completely loses her IB spot.

30.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
And if you don’t get in to those special programs, it comes down to UMich vs. SC (or some other school).

31.<<<billcsho>>>
OP should wait for the Ross decision and financial aid packages before making decision.

32.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
As an update: I am in both Ross and USC’s honors college.

33.<<<brantly>>>
Congrats!  You have great options.

34.<<<my2caligirls>>>
Well done! Ross is probably your best choice but I totally get wanting a change of scenery from where you grew up.

35.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Congratulations on both!
Clearly you really want to go to USC but worry that your wish to leave Michigan will lead you to a wrong decision.
What if you went to USC and decided you made a mistake (or didn’t get into IB), would you be able to 1) afford UMich 2) get into Ross?
(I think the reverse isn’t possible, since you wouldn’t have your merit scholarship from USC anymore).
Any other special programs you’ve applied to at either school that you’re waiting to hear from?

36.<<<veruca>>>
IF CC is anything to go by -there is definitely a bias against Southern Schools.  The way people use “southern” as an adjective on this site is shameful. I would go to Michigan.

37.<<<billcsho>>>
I think the decision is not that difficult. Go blue.

38.<<<brantly>>>

[/quote]

No, under the new rules you cannot apply to Ross again. Besides, there are very, very, very few spots for transfers.

39.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
I have decided to attend the University of South Carolina! Go Gamecocks!

40.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Congratulations!
Can you explain your reasoning, the factors you weighted, etc?

41.<<<LuckyCharms913>>>
So happy to hear it! I remember you posting when you had a good but not great ACT score, and you loved SC then. When you made that big improvement, it opened up some other options, but it also made you a great candidate for SC Honors College.
Michigan is a great school, but it seemed like your heart was in SC right from the start. Go and enjoy, especially for those months when it’s freezing at home but relatively balmy in Columbia.

42.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
I just wish you also posted your remarks in the Michigan forum instead of just here and in the SC one.  Best of luck to you.

43.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
Yes! I thought about it a lot over the last month, visited Umich since it is so close and talked to a lot of people. The only thing drawing me to Michigan was the ranking and name. I live 20 minutes away, grew up a Michigan fan, both parents went there, and I have two sisters there now. I really really wanted to do my own thing and try something new. All of that being said, I really wanted to go out of state. I found South Carolina, loved the campus and overall vibe I got from visiting. They offered generous scholarships which made going out of state affordable, and actually a bit cheaper than Michigan. On top of all of that, they have a terrific business school (and international business program) and honors college which intrigued me. When I thought a lot about it, I realized that I could see myself being much happier at SC. It offered a good price, great school spirit, and great academics in what interested me (maybe not as high as Michigan, but I just liked it better). My family definitely pushed Michigan, but everyone else I talked to said they had never seen anyone love as school as much as I seemed to like SC! @MYOS1634
I also thought about where I would possibly get a job after college. I know Michigan would open more opportunities all over the country, but I wouldn’t mind living in the southeast in places like Charlotte or @MYOS1634
@rjkofnovi I could have posted in Michigan, but living 20 minutes away, having so much family and friends there, and knowing people in Ross, I felt as though I knew enough about Michigan. I was looking more for perspectives of people from the SC side and neutral.

44.<<<1917souci>>>
Congratulations to you… Agonizing for sure. But by the end of the day its where you wanted to be and that makes it the right choice. I was one of the earliest posters and keep in mind all the good things I said
“The University of South Carolina Darla Moore International School of Business is rated number one by all accounts. It is NOT an easy school to get into. Having said that, my best friend son graduated from this school last year. He did an internship at Google in Ann Arbor (yes Google is in Ann Arbor) and was offered employment once he graduated.

45.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@1917souci Thanks! I am very excited and happy with my choice.

46.<<<intparent>>>
I see you have decided, but I do have a comment.  I grew up 30 minutes from Ann Arbor, was a 3rd generation Wolverine, and went to Michigan & Ross.  It felt like a different world, honestly.  I spent time with bright (some brilliant) students and profs from all over the country, and in some cases all over the world.  I was immersed in coursework and opportunities that were nothing like my HS life.  Ann Arbor is a great town to live in the middle of.  My parents tried to give me space, never dropped in unannounced.  I saw HS friends sometimes on campus, but wasn’t obligated to spend time with them if I didn’t want to.
Once I was out of college, the Michigan name opened doors for me, too.  I am in a business where my resume gets reviewed a lot, and I often get, “Michigan —that’s a good school” comments when they get to that part of my resume.
You can move elsewhere after undergrad.  And a Michigan degree makes that easier.
I didn’t love everything about my experience there, but that is more that I might have thrived most at a smaller school.  But I would pick Michigan over South Carolina every single time.  It is silly to pay OOS tuition in this case.  Don’t be put off by it being close to home — it is a whole different thing to be a student on campus than to live nearby.

47.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@intparent I am not actually paying out of state tuition, and it is about $8,000 cheaper per year at South Carolina due to a scholarship.

48.<<<intparent>>>
Helpful — but I’d still pick Ross if you got in.  UMichigan is a world class university, and Ross is a tremendous BBA program.  It is not smart to turn it down just because it is in your back yard.

49.<<<pbmcdoug>>>
@intparent Again, that is not the only reason why. I like the campus, honors college, and overall vibe that I get when at USC.

50.<<<sevmom>>>
@pbmcdoug , Sounds like you made a great choice, based on finances , the honors college, and the vibe and location you’re looking for. Hope you have a wonderful time at the  University of South Carolina!

51.<<<trackmbe3>>>
@pmcdoug Congrats on your Decison! It takes courage at your young age to stand by your conviction and decline acceptance to Ross when overwhelmingly everyone in your life advises you to go to Michigan Ross. While it’s important to get input from close family and trusted friends, even advice from college gurus here on CC, at the end of the day you have to do your own research and trust your own instincts and make these type of executive decisions for yourself because this is your life! Some of the most successful people in life have made decisions that went against the grain of common opinion and defied expectation. As many other folks on CC have stated before me, your success in life will be determined by you, not the undergrad school you attend. There are millions of successful businessmen and women in the USA who did not attend Michigan and Michigan Ross. And I’m hoping one of those people will someday include my son who attends Ohio State Fisher. While the Michigan name on your resume may garner some “aha” moments from folks, such moments last for the first few seconds of an introduction and then don’t matter. What matters is your competence and intelligence, your knowledge and experience, your  initiative/efforts, your enthusiasm and determination. Best of luck!

52.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
“While the Michigan name on your resume may garner some “aha” moments from folks, such moments last for the first few seconds of an introduction and then don’t matter.”
Of course you have to get the interviews from the most desirable firms first trackmbe3.  That’s the real “aha” moment.

53.<<<Biscuit_smom>>>
Congrats @pcmbdoug!   My S is in similar quandry with UMD and “USC”, accepted in honors college and in the engineering…he hasn’t visited yet but will in the next couple of weeks.

54.<<<Cookies510>>>
It appears @pbmcdoug carefully weighed his options and made a thoughtful decision.  I’m sure he’ll be successful regardless of the school he attends.  @intparent There’s more to life than work, money and the ranking and prestige of your alma mater and success isn’t measured by the size of your paycheck or who your work for.  Quality of life matters and a college needs to be a good fit in addition to offering a high quality education.
There’s also a study by a Princeton economist found that the earnings of students from Ivies and students who were accepte at elite schools but chose to attend elsewhere were essentially the same.
"In 1999, economists from Princeton and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation looked at some of the same data Professor Eide and his colleagues had used, but crunched them in a different way: they compared students at more selective colleges to others of “seemingly comparable ability,” based on their SAT scores and class rank, who had attended less selective schools, either by choice or because a top college rejected them.
The earnings of graduates in the two groups were about the same — perhaps shifting the ledger in favor of the less expensive, less prestigious route. (The one exception was that children from “disadvantaged family backgrounds” appeared to earn more over time if they attended more selective colleges. The authors, Stacy Berg Dale and Alan B. Krueger, do not speculate why, but conclude, “These students appear to benefit most from attending a more elite college.”)"
Congrats @pbmcdoug on making your decision.  Now you can enjoy the remainder of your senior year!

55.<<<intparent>>>
I’ve certainly recommended that students not always attend the highest ranked schools they get into.  In fact, both of my kids attended schools for fit that weren’t the highest ranked schools they got into.  But Ross is a pretty exceptional school for a BBA, with particularly good opportunities who want to study business.  In this case, I think you WOULD find that Ross graduates earn more if that is the criteria you want to use.  Also, I think the OP has honestly been looking for reasons to not stay close to home – and I think in this case, they are making a mistake.  But obviously they are free to make their own choice, and give that Ross spot up to someone else.

56.<<<sevmom>>>
T

57.<<<TheTennisNinja>>>
go to Michigan. The Big House awaits.

58.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Just be honest with yourself.  If you want to choose a school because of campus, honors college, and overall vibe, that’s great.
Just remember that when it comes to recruiting opportunities, recruiters won’t give two figs about the campus or vibe and Ross (or other elite majors like CS at UIUC) will be seen as equivalent or superior to many honors colleges.
But yes, you don’t have to choose a school to maximum ROI or recruiting opportunities (though that is a uncommon tack for a b-school major, but I digress).
BTW, I’m speaking as a neutral.

59.<<<Cookies510>>>
What the findings of the study really say is that its the students that make the school, not the other way around. They have it in them to succeed which is why the elite schools accept them in the first place.  This kid has what it takes and there’s more than one path to a successful business career.  While rankings are useful they aren’t the be all end all.   Far too many “highly ranked” colleges game the rankings to attract more and more applicants which in turn makes them more selective.

60.<<<brantly>>>
^^^Exactly.

61.<<<Setter4life>>>
Plenty of amazing, talented, and high stat kids end up going to ALL kinds of schools including USC   Not everyone goes to these elites schools for whatever reason.  The poster will among many bright students at South Carolina.  He is a business student and this is his first major business decision … Just saved himself close to $40K by choosing to go the top IB school… Good for him!

62.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
" Far too many “highly ranked” colleges game the rankings to attract more and more applicants which in turn makes them more selective."
Private schools are notorious for doing exactly what you stated Cookies510.
