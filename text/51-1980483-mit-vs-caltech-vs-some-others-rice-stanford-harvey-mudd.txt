Hello everyone I was admitted to and am considering attending the following schools:

2.<<<Dunboyne>>>
vs some others she says. What are the others? Oh, just Rice, Mudd, Stanford, Pomona, Chicago, Swat.

Nicely done. And your parents are worried about prestige? LOL Any chance you can get them on here?

3.<<<Sunny66>>>
Congrats! I think Rice and Pomona may be a great fit for you. Try to visit both.

4.<<<menloparkmom>>>
I think you may have a hard time finding students like yourself at CT, especially those that are as interested in the Humanities as you will at MIT. MIT has a wider range of majors than CT, is far bigger than CT, and is located in Boston which is full of other smart colleges kids at Harvard, Boston U, etc. I believe MIT students can cross register at Harvard for some courses.
I think you'll find your "people" easier in Boston than at a small U in Pasadena that is heavliy slanted toward the sciences.
Given the choice btw MIT and CT I'd choose MIT.

5.<<<Penn95>>>
@dsi411 I'd like to go to a place where the students enjoy learning and appreciate both STEM and the humanities/social sciences.

Out of the three schools you and/or your parents want (MIT, Caltech,Stanford), Stanford fits that description.

MIT is well-rounded compared to Caltech, not as much as Stanford.

Also while Stanford has prominent fratty, pre-professional and entrepreneurial elements, it is much more than that. It is top across all fields (probably the most well-rounded university out there), and attracts also a big intellectual, quirky, shy types in addition to the typical silicon valley-entrepreneur-bro types. Stanford has in fact a very quirky and unique culture.

At the end of the day if your parents are only willing to pay for either MIT or Stanford you will probably have to choose one of the two (not a bad position to be in i might add haha).
MIT seems like the best compromise between what your parents want and what you want.

6.<<<Ynotgo>>>
Congrats!

Other than the weather, one of the big differences between Caltech and MIT is the size. Caltech is tiny in number of students. Given that you describe yourself as very shy, probably you will be able to tell at CPW and PFW which of the environments is likely to be a better fit for you socially. For some shy people, a small environment is a place where they can come out of their shell. For others, a large environment is more comforting.

7.<<<nostalgicwisdom>>>
Honestly, I think based on everything you have said and prioritized, Pomona, U'Chicago, and Rice seem like the best fit for you. Especially the note about " I'd like to go to a place where the students enjoy learning and appreciate both STEM and the humanities/social sciences." Pomona has the highest % black students in its first year class of any top LAC or university this year, whereas Caltech in particular has one of the lowest. And this is a tiny factor, but 70% of Pomona rooms are singles.

Sure Pomona may not have the general prestige of the others, but it has exceptional outcomes: <url>https://www.****/blog/category/infographics/</url> It is a top 20 feeder school for math PhDs, top MBAs, med schools, and law schools. More importantly, it and the other LACs (+ Rice) will give you a much more supportive atmosphere than your most prestigious schools. If Pomona does turn out to be your best fit, I think you should show your parents all of its rankings (there are tons of them) so they can be made aware of its strengths. Pomona's most popular majors are CS and math, and it has the highest % of STEM majors of any LAC after Harvey Mudd as well as more than most of the Ivies.

On finances, all of these schools have comparable financial aid policies (100% need met), so if it's a big factor, you should pass your Caltech aid to the other schools and have them hopefully match it.

8.<<<nostalgicwisdom>>>
Ah, also, while yes MIT/Caltech/Stanford will dwarf your other schools in the strength of their math departments + number of courses offered, Pomona/Mudd extensively collaborate along with the other Claremont Colleges to create a thriving math community. I think some 200 math courses are provided each year, and the rare student who has already taken all the advanced coursework at the first two schools (which I've never heard of) has access to Claremont Graduate University's graduate level math programs too. So you're not going to be in a shortage for the courses you can take, which may be the case at other small, stand-alone LACs. Pomona students have access to a lot more opportunity than their size indicates thanks to the Claremont Colleges + Pomona's huge endowment per student (second highest of all your schools, after Stanford)

9.<<<Ballerina016>>>
Will you be attending CPW tomorrow? My D16 had the same choices you had (minus Stanford) and she chose MIT. Prestige wise all schools you got into rank very high so this should not be a factor. What do you like : small LAC or large university? East coast or west coast? My Southern California girl loves Boston, but bad weather is something to consider. Do you like quarter or semester system? MIT has this amazing one month IAP period in January when students can do winter externships, take fun classes, do UROPs or travel abroad.

Good luck!

10.<<<CA94309>>>
[quote]I'd like to go to a place where the students enjoy learning and appreciate both STEM and the humanities/social sciences.[/quote]
If money is not a concern, MIT will give you the best experience. MIT puts a lot of emphasis on humanities even though it is primarily a tech school. I would avoid Stanford, it has become a tech school where you are looked down upon if you are a humanities major. Please read the blog of Cath a current student. You can Google it "Cath in College W for Wisdom"

11.<<<dsi411>>>
@Ballerina016 Yes, i'm going to CPW tomorrow.

Thanks everybody for the responses so far! Pomona sounds very appealing but my parents aren't fans of the lesser known schools on the the list. I'll still look more into Pomona though.

12.<<<insanedreamer>>>
What a list! Congrats!

I'd say Mudd because you have the Claremont consortium to satisfy your interest in humanities. And it's seriously as prestigious as the others by those who are in the know (grad schools and top employers). True, it doesn't have the same "brag" as Stanford or MIT for your parents' friends.

Otherwise, I'd go with Caltech over Stanford or MIT. Not to mention cheaper! Wow. Congrats.

If you go to Caltech or Mudd, be ready to study hard. Very, very hard. You will not eat or sleep for four years ;). But you'll get a fantastic education, be with the smartest kids in the country and have your pick of grad schools and jobs. By the way, Mudd and Caltech have higher average SAT scores than Stanford and MIT. Also, Caltech and Mudd top the list of colleges who produce STEM PhDs (Reed is 3rd).

13.<<<whatisyourquest>>>
Wow, congratulations! That's an impressive list! My son was in a similar situation (MIT/Caltech/Rice... he didn't apply to Stanford). He chose MIT and is VERY happy there.

My son went to both MIT CPW and Caltech PFW. At the latter, he learned that a significant percentage of students "flame out." My understanding is that if their grades fall too low, they have to sit out a semester. That really freaked him out.

As several have already mentioned, MIT and Caltech are very different: Big vs small. Cold vs warm. Diverse vs not so diverse. Gender balanced vs skewed male... MIT is also arguably much better known. Since your parents care a lot about prestige, show them this ranking:

<url>https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/worlds-most-prestigious-universities-world-reputation-rankings-2016-results</url>

which has it as Harvard, MIT, Stanford, in that order. Caltech comes in at 10.

I encouraged my son to go to the university that was the best fit for him. If he had attended Rice, that would have been fine with me! I am a Rice grad and loved it there. But I also asked him to consider the relative strengths of the various schools. A huge appeal of MIT is that it's so incredibly strong in so many disciplines, and not just in STEM; MIT is at the top in linguistics, philosophy, economics, business, architecture, etc. Many kids end up changing majors. Nothing is lost at MIT, if you choose to do so. That's generally not the case at other universities.

14.<<<Mahindra>>>
@dsi411 What were your stats? How was tuition reduced so much for each of these very expensive colleges? Btw, just like everyone in the chat, I'd recommend you to go to Stanford since it's a mixture of STEM and a liberal arts college.

15.<<<tucsonmom>>>
You have some really great universities to choose from. Each school has its own unique culture. Harvey Mudd has just as high of a reputation in the STEM world as MIT, Caltech, and Stanford do. It's just that outside the STEM world, not as many people in the general population know about it.

Consider the culture at Caltech, for example:
You're assigned to a "house" at the beginning of freshman year. There's a rotation where all of the freshmen spend time in each house before being assigned. Dinner each evening is at the same time for everybody in the house (aka dorm) and the meal is held family-style. You can't officially declare your major at Caltech until the end of freshman year and every freshman takes the exact same set of classes.

Between Harvey Mudd and Caltech, both schools are pretty active when it comes to partying. BUT there are also plenty of students there who don't drink.

16.<<<happy1>>>
If you don't like Stanford (and I think it is worth re-visiting), then it sounds to me that MIT would meet your needs and satisfy your parents.

17.<<<dsi411>>>
I'm at MIT CPW right now and I like the school a lot so far (though I wasn't prepared for the weather to be this cold and rainy). It will be interesting to see how Caltech's Prefrosh Weekend compares.

@Mahindra Here's my comment on the Stanford results thread, it includes my stats. <url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/discussion/comment/20506433/#Comment_20506433</url>. My mother owns a business and my dad is retired from the navy, but the business lost money in the tax year that I used for financial aid, so the schools gave me a lot (or at least most of them did).

Thanks again everyone! I appreciate this, it will help make the decision easier.

18.<<<Miles Perrara>>>
If you are visiting Caltech, can you extend the visit another day? If you are from So. California, then you know that Harvey Mudd and Pomona are 20-25 minutes away. I would recommend that you try to talk to some math faculty at Harvey Mudd, as it sounds like there could be a good fit for you. As for your parents, maybe they can learn to laugh when their friends ask Harvey WHO?

19.<<<mobius911>>>
Nothing to add to the previous comments, but I do love seeing Stanford in the parenthetical 'other' category!

20.<<<sushiritto>>>
I've been on the campus alot over the years and I've never found Stanford to fratty, pre-professional and entrepreneurial. Now, I think the Stanford band and the mascot (tree) are ridiculous, but otherwise Stanford seems to have a bunch of very nice kids and teachers. And I'm not sure you can find a more diverse student body anywhere else in the country. Now, I'm sure someone here will come up with a statistic that shows Stanford is last in terms of diversity.

I wish my D will have the pick of MIT, CT, Stanford, etc. next year. Wow, awesome choices.

21.<<<Ynotgo>>>
@dsi411 Will things be OK for you in years when your FA is not based on a money-losing year for your mom's business?

22.<<<nordicdad>>>
based on your first post, I am a little surprised Cal Tech is so close to the top of the list. It seems to be the weakest outside the STEM classes. It seems like the strongest choices are the Mudd/Pomona combo or MIT. Much of the reputation of these schools is based on their grad schools. That is not the case with the Claremont schools.

23.<<<SlitheyTove>>>
[quote]My mother owns a business and my dad is retired from the navy, but the business lost money in the tax year that I used for financial aid, so the schools gave me a lot (or at least most of them did).[/quote]

Sounds like your costs may go up quite a bit in future years. Could you ask the schools to give you a sense of what your FA package will look like for future years? Make sure that the cost in future years is going to be affordable for your family.

OK, if you've done that and everything is still affordable:
[quote]I'd like to go to a place where the students enjoy learning and appreciate both STEM and the humanities/social sciences.[/quote]

As much as I have a warm and fuzzy place in my heart for Caltech, this quote from you says to me that you should look elsewhere. Every school on your list will give you this to some extent, but the two that stand out to me as having the happiest students who love learning across a variety of disciplines are Rice and Pomona. Pomona will give you access to Mudd classes via the consortium.

That said--these are all wonderful schools (as you know). There are no horrible choices in terms of academics.

Even if you can't visit, contact the math departments at each school. See if you can talk to some undergrads, either phone or email. Female students if possible (black female even better). Get a sense of their experience.

As a parent, yes, prestige is nice. Having a happy, successful child is in my opinion even better. :-)

24.<<<coolweather>>>
Caltech Prefrosh Weekend is very welcoming. It may make it harder for you to give up Caltech.

25.<<<Ballerina016>>>
Weather and long flights are the only weak points of MIT coming from Southern California. They have a storm with rain and winds today but it will be 77F in Boston next week if you plan to stay that long.

26.<<<verblender>>>
i went to mudd for chemistry, now i make $170k a year in total compensation at 40yrs old. my story is not uncommon. there's a very high hit rate if you can survive mudd to become very successful because they train you to look beyond the science and help you focus on how you can be a successful person. most the other places don't have such a success rate, though they are all great schools.

27.<<<dsi411>>>
Thanks everyone, I think MIT is my top choice now (after a couple days at CPW). If I were to assign percentages I'd say there's a 60% chance I'll go to MIT, 25% chance I'll go to Caltech, and 15% chance I'll go somewhere else at this moment. However I haven't gone to Caltech Prefrosh Weekend yet. I'll probably be able to make my decision after that. Thanks.

28.<<<intparent>>>
I'm sorry your parents are not in favor of Mudd. Most Mudders KNOW they've found their tribe there, and you sound like one of them.

29.<<<Arwen1>>>
Congrats on your awesome acceptances!

I think a parent on this thread mentioned this, but the flameout at Caltech is real. It's a small % of the class, but it's a recurring theme because of the intensity of the curriculum there. One of my good friends was a MOPer (tippy top ranked math student in US) and won a gold medal in the International Physics Olympiad, and flamed out hard at Caltech. He didn't take a semester off, but his love for math and physics got burnt out.

It is a minority of the class for sure who burns out, but the minimum required academic intensity at Caltech is more rigorous than at MIT, where there's a bit more breathing room to pull back or to be as intense as you want to be (just as intense as at Caltech). MIT also has more diversity if you're interested in the humanities and you can cross-register at Harvard.

Also, as someone who's helped organize admit weekends, they're a great preview, but do keep in mind that they're a bit self-selecting; i.e., it's usually the more happy/sociable students who are volunteering to lead events and interact w students.

30.<<<roethlisburger>>>
Congrats on all the great choices. I think Caltech is just as prestigious for STEM as MIT/Stanford. Although my first choice would be MIT or Stanford, I think you should at least visit the University of Chicago. The University of Chicago is very strong in math. Ngo Chau teaches there. It may be more balanced than Caltech/MIT, since the humanities are important to you.

31.<<<whatisyourquest>>>
As @Arwen1 mentioned, universities present their best image during admitted student events.

Something that the OP could do to get numerous, unfiltered accounts of student experience is look online for student reviews (e.g., the website Niche). While it's conceded that these websites don't have a verification process (i.e., anyone can post anonymously, which of course is true for CC too), one does get a general sense about how content the study body is.

Regarding Caltech, one review that I read stuck with me. The reviewer said that for 1/3 of the students, it's the absolute best place in the world; these kids flourish in a way that they couldn't anywhere else. Another 1/3 struggle mightily, but emerge with a world-class STEM education and fearsome analytical skills. The final 1/3 are absolutely miserable and regret that they chose to attend... I'm curious if @Arwen1 agrees with this assessment.

Regarding HMC, many students in reviews that I read loved the camaraderie, but grumbled about how difficult it is to graduate with a GPA that employers respect, unless they were familiar with how tough the grading is at HMC... I attended a talk by Maria Klawe (HMC President) in which she said that there had only been five students to graduate with a 4.0 during her tenure (since 2006).

And, of course, MIT famously has IHTFP. Some students may chose the positive definition, while others the negative. And still others vacillate.

32.<<<intparent>>>
I believe Mudd is up to something like 8 4.0s in their history now. :). My kid wishes her GPA was higher, but thinks her education could not be better.

33.<<<fortiori>>>
@intparent : Regarding GPA at Mudd: How do you compare it with MIT, Caltech, Stanford in terms of relative difficulty of maintaining 3.5 or 3.75. Based on cc posts and my personal conversations with others, my conclusion is it will be easier at Stanford. The order of difficulty appears to be Caltech, Mudd, MIT, Stanford for Engineering, Science majors. Stanford being the easiest by a good measure. Please feel free to disabuse me of any false notions. I am just trying to assess things as we have grad/med school in plan after undergrad. GPA plays a role in top tier grad admissions along with other factors.

Anyone in the know, please chime in.

34.<<<menloparkmom>>>
If by "grad school" you are possibly thinking of PhD programs , then know that LOR's from professors, the "reputation" of the college, GRE scores AND GPA in ones major are ALL very important the admission committees, which are made up of Professors.
Any one applying to a PhD program from ANY of those colleges will get a serious read- not college has an advantage one way or another- profs KNOW how hard it is to get top grades in STEM subjects at the top colleges.

35.<<<intparent>>>
I can't compare, only know that Mudd's average graduate GPA is in the 3.3-3.4 range. I would NOT attend there if med school is the goal. Other types of grad schools seem to understand and make some accomodations for the Mudd grade deflation. Not med schools.

36.<<<whatisyourquest>>>
Just FYI, MIT uses a 5.0 scale.

37.<<<Arwen1>>>
@whatisyourquest I can't say I know enough about Caltech to talk about the 1/3 1/3 1/3 split, but I do think there is some...minimum required academic intensity that can be extremely tough and not easy to predict as a high school student who's used to gliding through his/her coursework.

38.<<<dsi411>>>
I just recently returned home from my visit to Caltech and I really enjoyed it. I think i'm leaning slightly towards Caltech but it could still go either way. At this point I've decided to decide between just MIT and Caltech. I really like the community and atmosphere at Caltech, more so than MIT, but I wonder if i'll be missing any opportunities by going to Caltech over MIT. I also wonder if the small size might feel limiting after a while. I also went to a presentation about the humanities and social sciences at Caltech and their offerings seem good, or at least adequate, so I'm not too worried about that. Also the weather at Caltech's prefrosh weekend was much better than the weather at MIT's campus preview weekend, I'm not sure if I could survive MIT's weather. And yet, I feel as if I'll be missing out on things if I choose Caltech over MIT. Any advice?

39.<<<mamaedefamilia>>>
Sorry that Mudd/Pomona fell off the list because the combination sounds like it checks a lot of your boxes. What was the cost at Mudd (minus the loans)?

Curious, why did your parents veto Chicago?

Congrats on your many acceptances!

40.<<<Ynotgo>>>
My son is still at Caltech's PFW, so I haven't heard from him directly about his thoughts. My husband is there and was impressed by how they talked in the family-only sessions about using the small size very intentionally to make sure that everyone is supported by multiple layers of advisors, so that students don't get left behind despite the workload.

He doesn't have MIT as an option, so his is a different choice. He did go to admitted students events for CMU SCS, and they didn't say much at all about support services for CS majors or ways they make sure students do social things, despite that school also being known for a fairly heavy workload.

Would you get equivalent social support at MIT? Or might you get lost in the crowd?

Remember that you only have time to take advantage of a limited number of opportunities--that is, you can only do one internship or summer research project at a time, even if you have more opportunities at one place than the other. So, the question may be whether there are opportunities in areas that interest you at Caltech.

Are there specific opportunities at MIT that you'd miss having at Caltech? Or is it more a general worry about the size?

41.<<<hebegebe>>>
Congratulations!

D and I visited Stanford, MIT, Rice, and UChicago. Even though I am an MIT grad (and happen to be on campus as I am writing this), UChicago was clearly the best fit for her. She just returned from the overnight completely excited to attend.

Your parents have their priorities wrong. Everyone who matters knows about UChicago, and perhaps outside of CS startups, there are zero opportunities you are missing relative to your other schools . You should visit if you can.

42.<<<coolweather>>>
California Blvd or Massachusetts Ave.
The OP has no more time to add another variable to the equation. Go to where you like.
I liked Caltech. My son preferred MIT. And felt sad when I heard his decision.

43.<<<Ballerina016>>>
At this point it is about fit. Both finalists on your list are amazing academically. There's no right or wrong answer. Weather at Boston is very hard for a California kid. My DD survived winter by spending IAP back home externing for a startup in CA. I can only speak about intensity of MIT, but with unlimited amounts of opportunities school and Boston location offer outside of academics, absolutely insane amount of workload doesn't leave much time for anything else.

44.<<<csdad2>>>
Congrats, you have some great choices there. MIT and Caltech are known as very serious/intense places -- which is fine, if it's right for you. Since you have them as your top choices, after learning about them and visiting them, you are probably aware of this and feel that's the the kind of environment you want to be in. That's great.

To echo some of the other replies, MIT is probably stronger in non-STEM subjects than Caltech.

I wouldn't worry too much about missing out on things at a school you don't pick (unless they're specific things that you've identified as very important). Every school has their own unique characteristics, and you pick one of them because you feel its characteristics make it the best option for you. But you can't have everything.

But I wanted to bring up Mudd again. Mudd is also very strong in STEM, and is known for a similar level of seriousness/intensity as those other schools. In addition, it has the advantage of being part of that consortium (i.e., with Pomona), which would help greatly in access to non-STEM subjects. You say your parents nixed it because of apparent lack of prestige, but I would encourage you to revisit this with them, and see if you can make them realize what a top school it is, and what an opportunity it presents.

This is all assuming you haven't completely eliminated Mudd yourself at this point. You're in southern California, so maybe you can work in another visit there.

45.<<<CA94309>>>
@dsi411 One more thing you may want to keep in mind is what you plan to major in. MIT has more choices than Caltech, check the list from both and see if they offer the major(s) that interest you.

46.<<<CU123>>>
It's a shame when a child gets into a top school like Pomona which may be a great fit, but gets overruled by a parent because none of there friends recognize the name, Pomona, and ends up at an Ivy that they don't fit in at all.

47.<<<dsi411>>>
Thanks for the help everyone. I've committed to MIT! My mother contacted the financial aid office and after reviewing more documents they will reduce the price.

48.<<<Ballerina016>>>
Congratulations!

49.<<<Mahindra>>>
@dsi411 Congrats

50.<<<renaissancedad>>>
I think MIT will be a very good fit for you. Congratulations!

51.<<<chemist76>>>
Prestige will have the majority of you drowning in debt. MIT is clearly a top notch school, Stanford as well. But in your case, will going to the first two make any difference in your life? Will going to cal tech make life hard? No. If your parents don't care about price, then go right ahead. But cal tech is top notch, might not be as big as mit.. but you'll still get a quality education

52.<<<coolweather>>>
Campaign time is over. Let's the OP have a good meal and good sleep.
