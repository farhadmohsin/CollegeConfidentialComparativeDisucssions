1.<<<ksspang>>>
I've been accepted to both schools, and I find it very hard to choose between the two.

2.<<<BushD403>>>
I would pick UM-TC. They both have very good programs and I'm assuming your a resident of either Minnesota or Wisconsin so that you can go to both for cheap b/c of the agreement thing. They both have very good engineering and comp sci programs but since you seem to like UM's campus better, i would go there if I were u. Academically I would say theyre about the same with UW-M having slightly (not much, but slightly) better academic reputation.

3.<<<ksspang>>>
i also have a lot of friends at madison, which is always good for adjusting, I live in WI btw, and the only 1up that TC has is a better campus. I like the campus better at TC but the atmosphere better at UW

4.<<<barrons>>>
UW has significantly more national idenity and prestige, 24/7 campus atmosphere, and a much better campus for actually spending time on with the lakefront, sailing, and lively atmosphere. No comparison. CS is also better at UW.

5.<<<Coolbrezze>>>
Tough choice, probably madison.

6.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Wisconsin>Minnesota.

7.<<<jotajota218>>>
I'm was in a similar situation. I live 4 hours from the U of M and a half hour from Madison. I got accepted into both.

Academics:
I don't understand how people can think the UW is so far superior to Minnesota in everything. I live close to Madison and I don't think that at all. If you ask me the UW is overrated by far and UMN is underrated. They are both large research based Big Ten schools. Both have large student bodies. Sure the UW has a slight edge on the strength of student that attends, but when you have CSOM and IT at the "U" I feel it's a wash. At the UW you will have a TON of TA's, not to say UMN won't, but it is much more prevalent at the UW.

CAMPUS:
I must say it is gorgeous on the UW Campus at night right on the lake and the lights from the capital and State Street. However, the rest of the campus is spread out and outside from the beauty of the Lakeshore area, it's a fairly ugly. I really enjoyed how UMN feel centered around the East Bank. For an urban school I felt a better sense of campus there. After talking to students from each school, the feel I get from each campus made it easier for me to choose. At Madison there will be parties nearly 7 days of week. Drinking is much more prevalent (outside of State Street there isn't exactly terribly much more to do in Madison). At the "U" there is still partying, but not nearly as much. The "U" gave me the feel of a much more laid back environment. As far as the comments stated above about Madison having a 24/7 campus atmosphere, when you have such an amazing city environment around you in Minnesota, why would you want to stick around the Union (i.e. Madison).

I'm sorry if my comments all seemed one sided. Both are great schools and you can't go wrong with choosing either. It all depends on the environment you want. If you want the excitement of the cities and a more "chill" atmosphere by all means choose Minnesota. If you want the more drinking/party/stay on campus sort of style, go to Madison. You will get a great education either way, just choose what kind of campus life you want. I chose Minnesota (actually sent in my letter turning down Madison yesterday) because of the chill atmosphere, cities, job placement in the area(Twin Cities, more than likely with Madison you'll end up in Milwaukee or Chicago), and the less liberal feel.

Good luck with your choice, and remember you really can't go wrong either way!

9.<<<ksspang>>>
thanks a lot to everyone, i think i'll go to Madison unless i can get a really good deal at minnesota with scholarships and aid, but you're input is appreciated

10.<<<diontechristmas>>>
They're both fantastic schools, but I'd go with UW

11.<<<CoffeeAddict9716>>>
From your first post, it sounds like you'd be happier at Minnesota. If that is the type of environment you want over Madison's, then by all means go with your gut and go the MN. Don't choose Madison because it's ranked a bit higher...both are well respected schools and MN has the edge in the Twin Cities for jobs obviously. Also, you said that the city was a bit overwhelming to you, but Minnesota's campus is in a much more quiet area, but students venture across the river to Minneapolis. I don't think the larger city would really be a problem since the campus is not in some bustling area...


Out of curiosity, what is it about UW's atmosphere that you find more appealing than UM's? The active, liberal political scene, the party scene...? That might help us give you more advice.

12.<<<ksspang>>>
well, i spent a little more time in madison, but i do know that MN students commute more than UW's, and i think it just felt smaller, more comfortable, i'm from a small town, it just felt more........cozy, i guess, if that makes any sense at all

[quote]Sure the UW has a slight edge on the strength of student that attends, but when you have CSOM and IT at the "U" I feel it's a wash.[/quote]
Wisconsin also has significant edge in faculty and departmental strengths. Wisconsin has always been considered a much stronger <i>research</i> university than Minnesota. For undergrad, Wisconsin is ranked #35 in USNWR compared to #61 for Minnesota.

And how does CSOM-IT make it a wash? The OP is interested in Computer Science and animation. It has nothing to do with MIS. And for Computer Science, Wisconsin is quite a bit stronger. Wisconsin is ranked #11 in USNWR and #10 in NRC, compared to #31 and #46 for Minnesota.
[quote]At the UW you will have a TON of TA's, not to say UMN won't, but it is much more prevalent at the UW.[/quote]
Perhaps you can show us some data backing up your claim that TA's are more prevalent at Wisconsin?

TA's are used mainly for discussion and lab sections, seldom for lectures. In my four years at Wisconsin, I had only ONE TA in my freshman English class with full responsibility of the course.

14.<<<jotajota218>>>
^
IT is one of the more selective colleges at the "U". That is where you get your B.S. in Computer Science. Being in one of the better colleges there doesn't help compared to being in the Liberal Arts area (CLA) of the school?

As for TA's I'm going off of the experiences of friends and family who have attended Wisconsin. I don't know when you went to Wisconsin, but having only one class where you couldn't approach a professor and stuck with a TA is hard to believe.

But, obviously since you went to Wisconsin it's a far superior school. I'm just trying to give Minnesota a little back-up since most CCers hardly pay attention to it when it is actually is a great school. Rankings aren't everything.

15.<<<Alexandre>>>
jotajota, I did not attend Wisconsin, but I too have known many alums and there experience (both academic and social) at Madison was hard to beat. Like at most major research universities, Wisconsin professors tend to focus a great deal on their research. This said, it is a sad cliche/myth (on CC that is) that classes are taught by TAs and that professors are unaproachable. Even at major research universities like Cornell and Wisconsin, over 95% of classes are taught by professors. Some of those classes (mostly introductory level classes) may have a discussion group that is lead by a TA, but the actual class is taught by a professor. 100% of those professor-taught classes have office hours where students may go and talk to the professor on a one-on-one basis.

At any rate, Minnesota is an excellent and sadly underrated university. I don't think it is quite as strong as Wisconsin though. Wisconsin is one of the top 10 public institutions in the nation. Minnesota, although one of the top 25 public institutions in the land does not quite make the top 10...in my not-so-humble opinion!

16.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Not that this should matter, but it seems to me that Minnesota has for quite some time been considered a lesser Big Ten school from posters on CC. It seems they rank Northwestern, Michigan, Wisconsin, UIUC, Penn State or Ohio State ahead of it. Minnesota seems to be relegated to the bottom half of the conference with the rest of the schools. I only mention this because some of the posters in this thread seem to feel that Minnesota and Wisconsin are about equal. Clearly many do not agree.

17.<<<Alexandre>>>
I wonder how people could differentiate between schools in the Big 10. I even used to do so myself. Upon deeper analysis, however, I have noticed that the majority of Big 10 schools are roughly equal in terms of quality.

Michigan and Northwestern are the top 2 Big 10 schools, closely followed by Illinois and Wisconsin. After those 4, the remaining 7 Big 10 schools are all roughly equal, each university possessing its own strength and weakness.

18.<<<Coolbrezze>>>
I thought Michigan State University was the top Big Ten school.

I think there's no question that for many decades Wisconsin was the better school. But Wisconsin has had bigger struggles to get resources from its legislature; there's a widespread perception among academics at least that it may be slipping a little as top academics leave for greener pastures. Minnesota, meanwhile, has been making a valiant effort to catch up, and notwithstanding its own ups and downs with the legislature appears to have made some progress. Most people I talk to in academia think Minnesota is on the way up, not on the way down.

If you have the online edition of the US News rankings, do a side-by-side comparison. You'll see these two schools are pretty evenly matched in almost all statistical categories. Wisconsin has a slight edge in PA but that may be partly fumes from its past glories (not to take anything away from the great faculty who are still there, of which there are many, but reputation tends to be a lagging indicator). Acceptance rates are virtually identical, s/f ratios are very close. Wisconsin maintains a very slight edge in the qualifications of incoming students but Minnesota is rapidly closing that gap, having become much more selective in recent years; and that probably will continue as Minnesota's new cut-rate OOS tuition rate will attract a lot of new apps from OOS students, and also as the perception gap closes and more kids from both Minnesota and Wisconsin take a closer look at Minnesota as a real competitor to Wisconsin (remember, kids from either state can go to either school for the same in-state price, and historically that's meant a net export of top students from Minnesota to Wisconsin).

The one place where Wisconsin has a decisive advantage is in graduation rates. Minnesota acknowledges this is a huge problem and is investing a lot of money and effort in trying to cure it, with some success to show for it already.

Bottom line, the gap is closing rapidly and is no longer all that great. I'd expect it to continue to close, especially if the Wisconsin legislature remains as tight-fisted as they've been in the recent past.

"I thought Michigan State University was the top Big Ten school."

Northwestern is the most prestigious university in the conference, no matter how you look at it.

That's not what I said. I had TA's in my discussion/lab sections but none in my lectures. Except for freshman English, I had a professor teaching in every one of my classes.

This is generally true in most of the top research universities. The only courses without a professor are some of the intro courses, typically in math and foreign languages. But don't take my word for it. Look it up in the timetable; check out the instructors and see what kind of courses have TA's teaching the lectures(<a href="http://registrar.wisc.edu/timetable/fall/pdftt.php" rel="nofollow">Office of the Registrar - University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>)

But how could you conclude that the TA situation is <b>more prevalent</b> in Wisconsin. I don't have any data, but since the two universities are so similar, I would venture to guess that the TA situation are about the same. By the numbers Wisconsin also has an edge here:

Wisconsin is the same size as Minnesota but has a smaller student/faculty ratio (13:1 vs. 15:1). It may be more logical to conclude that Minnesota has to use more TA's.

Overall, Wisconsin does have stronger faculty and stronger programs. The numbers all confirm that.

Don't get me wrong. I agree that Minnesota is an excellent school and the OP can get the same high level of education from either. I just want to make sure our discussion is based on facts and not hearsay.

My mistake. I thought you were referring to MIS in Carlson. But I still don't understand why CSOM and IT would balance out a slightly weaker student body at Minnesota. Are you saying that Carlson is better than UW business, and IT is better than UW engineering? You are aware of course that all the rankings suggest otherwise.

My take, having been a student at both schools (and a TA at MN!)

<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/643332-how-minnesota-twin-cities-2.html#post1061732928</url>

Regarding the campuses, my impression is that UW has an elegant core and the natural beauty of the lakeshore but UMN is somewhat unplanned and a hodge-podge of buildings split across multiple sites.

Let me add that "brain drain" has been a concern at Madison since I was a student there in the '70's and somehow it has at least maintained its reputation. And, as a MN resident, I have no sense at all that U of MN is "improving" -- certainly the state keeps reducing the revenue it sends the U's way. But, as has been mentioned, the biggest drawback UMN has is the somewhat fractured nature of its undergraduate experience. A fairly large percentage of its students are commuters. "Spirit" is much more easily found at UW.

26.<<<barrons>>>
I don't think an ACT average of 26 in anywhere near close to over 28 average. GPAs will vary from state to state and school to school but the ACT is the same everywhere. Also while there have been news stories of UW slipping, the facts are not supportive. UW has moved UP in total competitive research funding from around 5th to 1st (not counting the JH Federal funded national labs). It's faculty still are winning top awards at rates among the best for all universities (223 v 101 compared to Uminn). Same for NAS members and AAAS members. State funding has gone up far more than at Michigan, UVa and many other schools over the same period.

27.<<<Coolbrezze>>>
rjkofnovi


I know my top choices but may not get accepted into neither... and I'm also having second thoughts about some.

28.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
But barrons, Michigan still has a huge endowment compared to Wisconsin and I believe it like number three in the U.S. in research funding. Michigan hasn't relied as much on state funding for the past 30 years when they saw the writing on the wall.

29.<<<MilwDad>>>
I don't have much interest in entering the argument about which school is better. As a Wisconsin grad I'm certainly partisan, but I also think all the Big Ten universities are great institutions, and objectively that's hard to deny.

What I DO want to know is how a Wisconsin grad picks the name "GoBlue81" for a posting moniker. Blasphemy! :)

30.<<<belevitt>>>
Many bright high school students in these two states are faced with the same decision. My wife was and she chose UW Madison. Her reasons were that Madison was walkable and didn't require a car the way that the Twin Cities might. She also liked the cohesiveness of the campus (though admittedly it has a couple of big streets running through it). It's a tough decision as they both are excellent in many academic fields and both have a strong tradition of excellence. I chose Madison but I chose based on the depth of instruction in Microbiology and the wide variety of languages available, I double majored in Hebrew. Best of luck in your decision.

Well, the simple fact is that most OOS students at Minnesota right now are from the tuition reciprocity states/provinces of Wisconsin, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Manitoba. They already pay in-state rates, so they're not affected by the new OOS rate. Cutting OOS tuition should bring in a lot of non-reciprocity OOS applications, allowing the university to be more selective, thus boosting the credentials of its entering class. And to the extent those new OOS applicants are admitted and enrolled they'll be displacing either Minnesotans or students from the reciprocity states, thus bringing in more tuition revenue--$4K per year for each additional enrolled OOS. Of course, the per-student differential would be higher with a higher tuition, but there would be fewer OOS applicants and fewer of the accepted OOS applicants would actually enroll. I assume the university ran the numbers on this and calculated a $4K differential between in-state and OOS was the optimal point to achieve the dual goals of increasing selectivity and raising revenue.

Yes but I believe for 2008 the ACT average at Minnesota overall was a 27 which is getting awfully close to 28. At Minnesota's Carlson School of Business it was 29 and at the Institute of Technology (Engineering) it was a little over 29. In the College of Biological Sciences it was 30. There was a significant jump from in these numbers from the 2007 entering class to 2008, and that was before the new OOS tuition policy kicked in. I'd expect to see those numbers continue to creep up to fully match Wisconsin's within the next couple of years. The question is, can they pass Wisconsin's numbers?

No, it was 26.2. You are confusing admitted and enrolled.

Michigan HAD a great endowment. It has probably lost nearly half it's value due to heavy use of risky alternative investments.

UW's is down too but not nearly as much. I'm not sure about WARF which is an independent UW endowment and not counted in the UW numbers but was about $2 Billion at the end of 2007. It might have been more into higher risk stuff too. But UW has around $3-4 Billion right now and UM about $4-5 Billion so thjey are much closer than they were. UM is just behind UW in research funding. UMinn is well behind.

35.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Sure barrons, you expect me to believe that Michigan's endowment took a bigger hit than Wisconsin's without proof? Where are you seeing these figures? I live in Michigan and I haven't seen any numbers to support your contention.

36.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Michigan lost about 2 billion off it's endowment, which leaves it around the 5.6 billion mark. Still only a couple billion more than Wisky.

37.<<<barrons>>>
Here. It shows heavy (over half) invested in non-market high risk securities. Also reports that losses in same cannot be reported yet. Most are valuing such assets at 50% or less today.

38.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Barrons. I just checked out some endowment numbers and for the life of me I have no idea where you can claim that Wisconsin has a 3-4B dollar endowment. When times were good last year they might have have 2 billion according to what I read. Now that they have lost at least 30 % or more, I figure Wisky might have an endowment around 1.4B. Hardly in the range of Michigan at all. I am no expert at understanding financial data, but I can't see how you can be so certain that Michigan has lost more than half of its endowment by that small article that you posted.

39.<<<barrons>>>
You forgot WARF--Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation which is soley for UW Madison. There are a couple others but that is the big one.

As of 2008, WARF had an endowment of nearly $2.0 billion. A majority of WARF's income, around 70%, comes from Vitamin D.


<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Alumni_Research_Foundation" rel="nofollow">Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

<a href="http://www.warf.ws/" rel="nofollow">WARF - Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation</a>

Since its founding in 1925, WARF has:
Processed approximately 5,600 inventions created by UW-Madison faculty and staff
Obtained 1,820 U.S. patents on these inventions
Completed over 1,530 license agreements with companies all over the world
Given $915 million to the UW-Madison to fund research, programs and initiatives
Since 1928, the first year of the WARF grant, the university has used these monies to:
Support more than 53,010 research projects, including 1,500 in 2006-2007
Sponsor scores of named professorships, including 40 in 2006-2007
Fund thousands of graduate fellowships, including 145 in 2006-2007
Help retain top faculty
Partially or fully pay for the construction of nearly every research facility on campus, a total of more than 50 projects at last count
WARF today:
Manages over 856 pending and 933 issued U.S. patents on UW-Madison technologies, as well as 2,300 foreign equivalents
Offers more than 1,000 technologies for licensing
Maintains more than 940 active commercial license agreements, as well as 460 academic and commercial licenses on human embryonic stem cells
Has completed over 30% of it's license agreements with Wisconsin companies
Holds equity in 40 UW-Madison spin-off companies
In 2006-2007, WARF:
Processed over 410 invention disclosures made by UW-Madison faculty and staff
Filed 300 U.S. patent applications on UW-Madison technology
Obtained nearly 115 issued U.S. patents
Gave $50.0 million to the UW-Madison to support research
Signed 60 new license and option agreements
Took equity in 3 new UW-Madison spin-off companies

40.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
So Wisconsin is still about 2B behind Michigan. That's about right. And when the market turns around, the difference will be huge once again. My understanding is that WARF funding now has been expanded to the entire University of Wisconsin system of approx. 173,000 students. Michigan has about 40,000 on it's campus.

41.<<<barrons>>>
I think it's more like 1 Billion but what's a Billion among friends.

UM was so taken with UW's WARF and the patent setup that they sent people to Madison to copy it as they had nothing like it a few years ago.

I would recommend Wisconsin over Minnesota. I have been to neither school, but I think Wisconsin's national reputation is definitely better.

49.<<<swimguy112>>>
I have been to both schools, and for engineering, I would go to the University of Minnesota.

Average ACT score in the IT school is 29.4 which is strong for a state school. Minnesota's low ranking comes from all the athletes/reaches who get shoved into the College of Education and the College of Liberal Arts. If you like the Minnesota campus more, than by all means go to Minnesota. Your education will undoubtedly be no different, if not better at UMN.

Don't listen to all these "prestige" whores here who have never been to either campus. They live by the USNWR rankings, and consider it sacrilege to go against them. There is no difference between having "Wisconsin" V "Minnesota" on your degree. Go to the place that YOU feel is better.

"Northwestern is the most prestigious university in the conference, no matter how you look at it."

I don't agree ProudWolverine. You make it sound like Northwestern is way more prestigious than all other Big 10 schools. That is definitely not the case. Depending on whom you ask, you will get different answers. Overall, on average, I think Michigan and Northwestern are pretty evenly matched where reputation is concerned. Wisconsin is not far behind either.

53.<<<jec7483>>>
Northwestern is the most prestigious school in the conference. How does one measure reputation? I am not exactly sure. You could go by rankings, but as soon as someone's school is ranked below another I see them quickly send a "there's more to it than rankings" comment my way. Now, if their school ranks well, they are quick to use it. Anyway, not using the two rankings, I am going to go simply by the perceived name reputation of the schools. I guess it is my opinion of your school vs. the opinion you have of your school. I think people commonly put the conference as:

1:Northwestern
2:Michigan
3:Wisconsin

I am not going any lower, as I see no reason to hijack this poster's thread yet and send the thread on a 3 page tangent about the proper prestige order of the conference.

Michigan is the second school in the Big Ten in terms of undergraduate reputation. I don't think that is a slight towards Michigan, but I do think normally 9 out of 10 people would probably list Northwestern above Michigan. If anything, it's an apples to oranges comparison with Northwestern and the rest of the conference, as they are 1/4 the size of every other school in the conference and are the only private.

54.<<<barrons>>>
rjkonovi--you brought up the UM endowment not me. I was talking about state funding trends in general and mentioned UM, UVa and others in passing as having flat state funding which is quite factual. I rarely bring up UM in any negative way and often--very often defend it from some of the others on the board and you know who they are.

55.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
I was just teasing you a bit barrons. I know what you stated is correct. :-)

56.<<<ProudWolverine>>>
Alexandre, just like jec7483 has mentioned, most people would agree that Northwestern is the best school in the conference, with Michigan trailing behind it. The difference between Northwestern and Michigan in terms of their national reputation and prestige is clearly visible albeit arguably small.

57.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
I have to agree that UG Northwestern has a slight edge over Michigan. At the graduate level there really isn't much difference. Smaller top tier schools are almost always going to have a higher perceived prestige simply because they are more difficult to gain admittance.

58.<<<Alexandre>>>
ProudWolverine, I am not sure how either one of us can prove his point. My experience suggests that both schools are highly regarded.

59.<<<collegeapp09>>>
Go with UMN-TC!! I've visited both schools and it's a ton better. UW-Madison seems strictly a party school and nothing else. I actually am taking some classes at the U right now as a dual enrollment student and, surprisingly, I like it here a lot more than I thought I would. When I visited Madison, I just got the feeling that studies definitely were not taken as seriously as I would have liked.

60.<<<bclintonk>>>
^^ Speaking as an academic, I think most people in the academic community would say that as an overall university Michigan > Northwestern, and by a considerable margin. Michigan has better faculties and more prestigious programs in almost every field. But for the quality of the undergrad experience, I'd say that as a smaller school with more of an undergrad focus, Northwestern probably has an edge overall. But that's going to vary tremendously. People in the Residential College, the honors program, or other residential-learning communities at Michigan, especially those who end up in smallish majors where the faculty resources and s/f ratios available to them can be extraordinary, may in fact have undergrad opportunities at Michigan that rival or surpass those at Northwestern. Bottom line: don't be suckered by mindless fealty to US News rankings and those CCers who feed off them.

First off, UW-Madison is hardly "just a party school," and I'm not sure where exactly got that idea unless you were just making an assumption off of the popular press. There is a lot of hard partying, of course, but hey, aren't UW-Madison's graduation rates still a lot higher than UMNs? For being "only" a party school full of drunks who don't care about school, UW-Madison students sure do seem to have themselves together academically. Honestly, it seems like you are just trying to find ways to lower UW-Madison, like so many people at UMN unfortunately do.

Anyway, both universities are excellent academically. On a resume, it honestly won't make a difference one bit which school you go to. However, underneath it all, the academics, faculty, and just about everything else IS probably quite a bit better at UW-Madison, and UW-Madison has a WAY bigger, super obvious research presence (almost more than academics, really). But like I said, on a resume, it won't make much of a difference, if at all. Rankings, lists, and all that jazz are incredibly overrated and in the end, if you are going to a school like Minnesota or Wisconsin, its the person and how you present yourself that will determine how you end up much more.

With that said, what you should be asking yourself is this: What kind of experience am I looking for in college? And it is pretty simple:

If you are looking for a college experience full of everything college has to offer such as a distinct college culture, serious sports, an active and involved student body, and so on, then your search is already over: UW-Madison.

If you want to keep hanging out with your friends from your suburban Twin Cities high school and go home every weekend, then your search is again already over: UMN.

It's generally as simple as that.

The fact is, although lacking in racial minorities, UW-Madison's student body is exponentially more diverse than UMNs. UMN mainly has people from Minnesota and it's reciprocity states, and thus ideologically and life-experiencally they are pretty much all the same. Going to UMN, you don't get your eyes opened to all sorts of new experiences and so on.

This is definitely not the case with UW-Madison. Not only does the undergraduate program have thousands and thousands of very gifted undergrads from all over the United States, but from all over the world. And it isn't only slightly noticeable; you will see it pretty much everywhere you go. In fact, UW-Madison (I believe) has the second highest Jewish student body of Public Universities in the entire United States. Koreans, Japanese, Australians, Chinese, all sorts of Europeans, Mexicans, Chileans, and so on and so forth, I've met them all. They all come here because Madison has a nationwide "rep," not only as a party college where you can have fun, but a great academic school and a pretty rad city.

Furthermore, the students at UW-Madison are much, much more active. Student groups are much more successful, there is much more school pride, and there is just that "presence" which makes the college experience so special and easy to look back at with an almost overwhelming nostalgia. In that department, UMN is sorely lacking compared to just about every other Big Ten University. Although UMN students will tell you being in a big city "gives you more to do," I think being in the big city hurts UMN more than it helps it. The big city drowns out the college atmosphere and vibes severely. Plus, what do big cities really offer that you can continually experience over a city like Madison, which offers a lot to do in its own right, anyway?

Also, obviously nothing near UMN can compare to UW-Madison's culinary diversity. From my apartment just off campus, I had six middle eastern, four Japanese restaurants, two Indian restaurants, five or six Italian restaurants, and just about every other ethnic option within a five minute walk. State Street has over 200 businesses on it alone.

Better check your facts, Fox. Approximately 70% of the OOS students at Wisconsin are either from neighboring Minnesota (roughly 40% of all OOS) and neighboring Illinois (roughly 30% of all OOS). Not so much geographic diversity there. And that's not even counting OOS students from other nearby Midwestern states.

As for internationals, they're pretty close--and the numbers are pretty small in either case, 3.46% at Minnesota, 4.34% at Wisconsin. A difference to be sure, but hardly "exponential," and hardly indicative of Wisconsin being a bastion of diversity.

As for racial diversity, it's not even close: Minnesota has roughly 80% more Asian-Americans, 80% more African-Americans, and significantly more American Indians. Wisconsin has a few more Hispanics but those numbers are tiny at either school.

65.<<<TheDesertFox>>>
Where did you see those statistics? The last time I saw statistics for UW-Madison's student body, 60% of the graduating class was "in-state," which actually counted both Wisconsin and Minnesota. I went to UW-Madison for 5 years and have been all over UMN, and the study body at UMN feels much more 1) commuter-based and 2) midwestern. I went to Madison, and no matter what the stats say, there is an enormous geographic diversity, especially from the coasts. Go look in the UW-Madison forum for the "acceptance stats" thread; like no on in there is from the midwest! We have over 4,000 Jewish students alone, where do you think they all come from?

Both Wisconsin and Minnesota have a long way to go with racial diversity, though, which is why I didn't bring it up nor alluded that Wisconsin was somehow good in that regard. I'm actually shocked Minnesota has less Hispanics, because I barely saw any at UW-Madison. As for having more blacks and Asians, I believe it, but then again, you guys are sitting at over 51,000 while we are more at 41,000.

"As of fall 2006, 22.8 percent of undergraduates were classified as non-residents; 66.7 percent were Wisconsin residents, and 10.6 percent hailed from Minnesota"

How am I "way off." I admitted in the original post that UW-Madison didn't have much racial diversity. Did you read it?

And on top of that, UW-Madison *DEFINITELY* has much more geographic diversity than UMN. As someone else in this topic already said, very very very few people at UMN are not from the midwest.

So all this stats-slinging is pointless, really, because you are putting words in my mouth. Like that link says, 29% of 2006's entering class was not from Wisconsin or Minnesota. Do you think 29% of UMN's entering class is not from Minnesota, Wisconsin, ND, or SD? I actually saw statistics for 2004, and 90% of UMN is from Wisconsin and Minnesota. That is a very big difference, and part of the reason Wisconsin can afford to charge its in-state residents $2,000 less than Minnesota does theirs.

Thus proving my point.

68.<<<GoBlue81>>>
Excerpted from a Fall 2007 newsletter from the Office of Admission :
<url>http://www.admissions.wisc.edu/hsnews/hsnewsfall07.pdf</url>

"Freshman Class of 2007 Profile
... The class of 2007 is very diverse on many measures. While 70% of the freshman class is from Wisconsin and Minnesota, we have students from 43 other states and more than 30 different countries enrolling.

... The top feeder states were Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Illinois, followed by New York, California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts."

I believe Wisconsin also has more international students if you count also the graduate schools.

69.<<<Alexandre>>>
"Diversity" is hard to define. Over 50% of the undergraduate students at most universities, private or public, will come from the state itself or from its neighboring states. For example, only 15% of Duke's 6,500 undergraduate students come from NC. However, if you include Georgia, SC, Maryland, Florida and Virginia into the mix, you will find that roughly 60% of Duke students come from the mid-South Atlantic. At Stanford, roughly 3,000 of its 7,000 (45%) undergraduate students come from California. Arizona, Oregon and Washington students probably make up an additional 15% of its undergraduate population. At Cornell, roughly 60% come from NY, the Northeast and the Mid Atlantic. You will be hard pressed to find a university where all parts of the US are equally represented.

70.<<<dilksy>>>
"The last time I saw statistics for UW-Madison's student body, 60% of the graduating class was "in-state," which actually counted both Wisconsin and Minnesota."

60% isn't that close to 77%, especially when you're talking about how far away it is from 90% (assuming you're right about that number, which I'll believe when you actually present some concrete data).

The site I linked also mentioned that it's misleading to just look at incoming freshmen class (like you're doing), since OOS students are far more likely to graduate early/on time than in-state students. Even though the incoming class is 29% OOS, the actual percentage of students at the university from OOS is closer to 23%.

How exactly am I putting words in your mouth? I never said you were wrong about racial diversity, and I never made any claims that Minnesota was any better. You're the one making implicit assumptions that I'm taking the opposite viewpoint. All I'm doing is pointing out that you make yourself look like an idiot when you fabricate numbers that aren't accurate when the data is readily available online. Quote some actual numbers, and maybe then you'll have a post worth reading.

The University of Minnesota's 2008 entering freshman class is 5.5% international students, according to a story published in today's Minneapolis StarTribune relying on statistics supplied by the University. That's a higher international percentage than I've ever seen for Wisconsin. I don't have the comparable 2008 figures for Wisconsin, but the 2007 entering class at Wisconsin was 4.34% international.

<a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/south/39179922.html?page=1&amp;c=y" rel="nofollow">U goes global to attract a more diverse student body</a>

The full University of Minnesota residency breakdown:

Minnesota 64.8%
Reciprocity states* 21.4%
Other U.S. States 8.3%
International 5.5%

* reciprocity states (and privince) are Wisconsin, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Manitoba

And by the way, the 64.8% who are Minnesotans includes a lot of first-generation kids from recent immigrant families. The Twin Cities now have a huge Southeast Asian population, especially a lot of Hmong and Vietnamese, as well as a very large East African population, especially Somali and Ethiopian but a smattering from other African countries as well. This is a lot of what accounts for Minnesota's 9.35% Asian or Asian-American and 4.75% African-American student body. To suggest these kids are "ideologically and life-experientially . . . all pretty much the same" as white middle class Minnesotans and Wisconsinites, as TheDesertFox does in post #61, is just wildly off base.

I'd expect to see the international population continue to grow at Minnesota. It's a well recognized and highly respected brand, especially in China, and it's new tuition structure (approx. $14,600/year non-resident tuition) makes it a bargain for internationals in comparison with other schools.

I don't have anything against U of MN at all. I was just speaking from my own experience. Most of my experience at U of MN was when I applied and made several visits back in 2002 and in my freshman/sophomore years when I still hung out with some of my high school friends who went there(I went to college through 2007). Even the article says, until 2006, you guys had the lowest percentage of internationals. It appears that the U there has been changing a lot (as is a national trend as universities are increasingly competing). If you just started pulling more internationals in in 2006, I wouldn't have known. It is fairly disappointing to see that Minnesota is attempting the spam-mail route of advertisement popularized by Washington University in St. Louis, though, something Wisconsin has luckily never had to resort doing (not to stir the pot).

With that said, what both our universities are doing is probably damaging since clearly none of these people are going to stay in the US.

78.<<<bclintonk>>>
^ Defending against false accusations, certainly.

As for the suggestion that educating internationals is "damaging," I disagree.

First of all, some do stay; a smaller percentage than in the past, perhaps, as economic opportunities now abound in their home countries; but some do stay. Second, there are long-term benefits to increased international understanding, as well as a more educated global workforce creating a rising tide of prosperity that if properly managed should lift all boats. Third, there may be more direct payoffs to the local economy, as university alumni networks and old school friendships spread across international boundaries, expanding two-way opportunities for transboundary trade, investment, and business deals of all kinds. Simply put, the state of Minnesota is almost certainly better off economically due to the relationships that current Minnesota residents have with old school chums in China, and to the receptiveness of the University's rather impressive alumni network in China when Minnesota businesspeople come calling; that kind of goodwill is invaluable, especially in places like China where so much business depends on networks of personal contacts and bonds of trust. And finally, I truly do believe that the opportunities to interact with and learn from international students enriches the educational experience of all the U.S. students attending the University; it's a better and a stronger school for it, and that helps everyone who attends.

79.<<<TheDesertFox>>>
I agree, mostly. I wasn't all that serious. Well said.

80.<<<ewho>>>
bclintonk, how do you know there are less Chinese students in Wisconsin than in Minnesota? Also, how many high profile Chinese students are in Wisconsin? Like the sons or daughters of high ranking officials? The former Premier's son was there, now he controls a major investment bank in China. In China, Wisconsin is far more famous than Minnesota.

81.<<<bclintonk>>>
^ Well, I never said there are more Chinese students in Minnesota than Wisconsin---though there are definitely more Asian or Asian-American students at Minnesota, 9.37% v. 5.45% at Wisconsin. Princeton Review has those numbers:

<a href="http://www.princetonreview.com" rel="nofollow">Test Prep: GMAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, SAT, ACT, and More</a>

But now that you mention it, it does appear there are more students from China at Minnesota than at Wisconsin. At least the University of Minnesota believes so. It claims that its 8,000 alumni from China and the 1,200 Chinese citizens currently studying or teaching at the University of Minnesota are both unmatched "by any University in America."

<a href="http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/UMN_home/know/The_MinnesotaChina_Connection.html" rel="nofollow">Did You Know? : University of Minnesota, Twin Cities</a>

As for your claim that Wisconsin is "more famous" in China, I don't know how you could ever verify that. But if Minnesota has more alumni in China and currently gets more students from China, it's rather difficult to believe the claim.

82.<<<ewho>>>
Well, Harvard gets much fewer Chinese, can we say Harvard is less famous in China than Minnesota? Most of the students from China are/were graduate students, especially in the past.

Name one famous Chinese Minnesota graduate. I just gave you one from Wisconsin.

"

I'm not sure acceptance rates tell the whole story. Stats and rankings are bull****, as they can never tell the whole story. I know many people in my high school who graduated with under a say, 3.5,and didn't bother applying to Wisconsin but applied to Minnesota. Furthermore, having four reciprocity agreements instead of one, Minnesota receives a few thousand more applications than UW-Madison, leading again to a lower acceptance rate as it is forced to only admit a certain number.

When all is said and done though, Wisconsin holds more prestige than Minnesota within the United States. To a lesser degree, I'd expect this to carry overseas. Rankings or not, when I'm visiting family in Texas or more often California and I tell people "I went to UW-Madison," they automatically know that I must be smart. Minnesota just doesn't have that cultural je nai sais quio. To most people, they have no opinion. They may deduce it is a good university, but it doesn't "carry" that reputation the way Wisconsin does.

[quote]It claims that its 8,000 alumni from China and the 1,200 Chinese citizens currently studying or teaching at the University of Minnesota are both unmatched "by any University in America."[/quote]
There's a bit of exaggeration in that article. Several US universities have much longer history in China (e.g., Yale, Michigan) and likely have more than 8,000 alumni.

According to this - <a href="http://www.ii.umich.edu/um-china/index.htm" rel="nofollow">UM - China Inititiatives for the 21st Century</a> ... there are currently 876 Chinese students studying at UM. On top of that, there are 318 visiting Chinese faculty and scholars on campus. That adds up to 1,194, plus at least a couple hundreds or more full time faculty originally from China. "No other university in America can match either number" ... How would they know that?

"A recent survey conducted in China, for example, rated <b>the Carlson School of Management's MBA program for Chinese business executives</b> as the top such program in the United States." They are referring to the China Executive MBA program offered in partnership with Lingnan University, one of the top business schools in southern China. Graduates earn a joint EMBA degree from Lingnan and Minnesota and get to come to Minneapolis for commencement. I'm not aware of other US university offering similar programs in China. The Carlson/Lingnan CHEMBA program is highly coveted in China ... but to call it "the top <b>such</b> program in the United States" is deceiving. Btw, the Kellogg-HKUST EMBA offered in partnership between Northwestern and Hong Kong University of Science &amp; Technology is a much more acclaimed program of this kind.

[quote]<a rel="nofollow" href="/profile/TheDesertFox">TheDesertFox</a> wrote:[/quote]

There's no question that in the past---indeed until quite recently---Wisconsin was more selective than Minnesota. But Minnesota's selectivity has rocketed upward over the past several admissions cycles and is now coming very close to Wisconsin's.

I'm not even saying that overall Minnesota is as good as Wisconsin right now. I'd grant that in some areas Wisconsin has an edge, in other areas they're about even, and in some areas Minnesota has the advantage, but overall Wisconsin's still got a slight lead. You need to pick your spots, though, because Wisconsin isn't stronger in all aspects.

But the point is, Minnesota's been rapidly closing the gap in many, many areas, and they're not nearly so far apart as they once were. There's a kind of comfortable complacency to the Wisconsin attitude about all this; "Oh, we know we're better, we've always been better, OUR competition is Michigan, not Minnesota." When in fact Minnesota is poised to give them a real run for their money. Anybody notice that Minnesota jumped 11 places in the US News rankings in a single year, from 2008 to 2009? This is no accident; it reflects things like rapid advances in selectivity, to the point that the kid with the sub-3.5 GPA who just a few years ago was pretty much a shoo-in for admission to Minnesota is now more likely to get a deferral or a rejection letter. I hear this all the time from Minnesota alums: "Geez, back in my day anyone could go to the U. But now my kid can't get in, and I don't think I could have gotten in with these new more selective admissions standards."

And in terms of value, Minnesota is going to be looking more and more attractive to OOS students who look at that $7K/year difference in the price tag between the two schools and wonder if any slight reputational advantage enjoyed by Wisconsin, arguably based more on the past than on present-day reality, is really worth $28K more in debt by the time s/he's through urdergrad. I'm not knocking Wisconsin; it's still an excellent school and I wish I could convince my own D to put it on her "safety" list (no luck so far). But my point is, the difference between Wisconsin and Minnesota is not nearly so great as in the past, and in my judgment the gap is shrinking rapidly, to the point that it can be a perfectly reasonable and sound choice, and for many people a highly cost-effective one, to choose Minnesota over Wisconsin.

91.<<<ewho>>>
I basically agree with you on this post. Indiana recently declared that it is the new Wisconsin. I have no clues what does that mean. Cheaper for OOS at Minnesota is a big plus. But Minnesota is much less well-known for people on the east coast. Wisconsin is a little better because of its sports. Michigan is too expensive. Wisconsin, the once most progressive university in the country, definitely needs to hold itself up. I forgot which year they had a record number of National Merit Scholars (NMS): merely 8 in total out of how many enrolled? The high school near me alone has 20+ NMS this year. Michigan has done much better. Any kid comes to me for suggestions, my direction is always pointing to Michigan.

92.<<<TheDesertFox>>>
I hear you, ewho. But honestly, I've never really gotten rankings. I've seen Wisconsin ranked from 16th in the entire world by some Chinese study, to somewhere in the 300's by some other study. It's all about criteria, in the end, and you just can't peg one thing as this or that by measuring data which could really include so many different variables.

I mean, what is it that makes Michigan so great? The classrooms? The professors who actually spend little to no time with the undergraduate students? Or perhaps you could say its the student body themselves, but then again, they wouldn't be there if Michigan wasn't supposedly so great in the first place. So what is it that makes a Michigan education so much better than a Wisconsin education, or a Wisconsin education so much better than a Minnesota education, or a Minnesota education so much better than an education at Indiana? It's all a bunch of bullcrap IMO. If you are in the big ten, sans MSU maybe, it's the person, not the college.

So, I honestly think the University of Minnesota, Iowa, and others are already as good of a university as Wisconsin. Good in the sense that, it probably won't make a difference if a bright student goes to one school over the other. Wisconsin seems to have a "pride" that I don't see in other big ten colleges so much, though. An alumni-supporting-alumni thing that I can really only compare to USC.

But anyway, when it comes to "prestige" and "recognition," which is mainly what I have been talking about, UW does have significantly more than Minnesota, and even more significantly less than Michigan. I think the CC forums generally show that, as the UW board has 7 times the amount of topics of the Minnesota board (and no, it doesn't mean that 17-year-olds applying to Minnesota are just "busier"). People across the US know about Wisconsin. The University here often gets shout outs in movies and television shows, and in fact, MTV was filming a reality show about "college life" last fall as well. Maybe that is a bad thing, though.

Also, interesting thought: How does arguably the most economically depressed, hopeless major state in the country (Michigan) support such a prestigious university?

93.<<<danmam>>>
I'm stuck with this decision too (pending my almost sure rejection from MIT in mid-March). I live in Wisconsin and will be in engineering. I know Wisconsin's engineering program as a whole is stronger than Minnesota's, plus Madison is only about an hour and a half from me, while Minnesota is a 6 hour drive, so I'd rather choose Madison. However, Minnesota is offering $11,500 a year for 4 years, Madison is only offering $2250 (valedictorian scholarship) plus whatever other scholarships I win (probably no more than $3000, at the most).

Is it worth it to go to Madison, spend the extra money but get the "prestige" boost? Or is there really no reason to turn down UMN's scholarship?

Thanks for any advice.

94.<<<ewho>>>
You can always come back to Madison for graduate school, if money is an issue for you right now. However, if you can afford it, go to Madison. It is worth it if you pay in-state tuition.

95.<<<danmam>>>
It's not a matter of affordability. My parents have agreed to pay for half of an in-state education (basically what it costs at Madison for tuition+books+room/board+university meal plan). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Madison is probably going to be about $20K this year (including books, room/board, and meal plan), so my parents will chip in $10K a year (no matter where I go). That means if I go to Minnesota I won't be paying a cent out of my pocket.

Any other suggestions?

96.<<<noimagination>>>
> Also, interesting thought: How does arguably the most economically depressed, hopeless major state in the country (Michigan) support such a prestigious university?

Answer: U Michigan charges out-of-state students a lot. Also, I think (don't know) that Michigan sends most of its education money to Ann Arbor. For what it's worth, only 7% of the school's general fund comes from the state: <a href="http://www.vpcomm.umich.edu/budget/understanding.html" rel="nofollow">U-M Budget Update - University Budget - Understanding the Budget</a>

Minnesota is indeed going to be getting more selective. At the same time they are decreasing the size of the freshman class, they just received a record high number of applications (32,000).

While Wisconsin's applications dipped to 24,200 for a slightly smaller freshman class. Apparently, far less in-state people applied to the school, for a reason no one really knows, while out of state applications went up.

So TheDesertFox Michigan isn't so great and MSU is the worst school in the big ten. Interesting.

That's a myth. In ChE, most of the profs teach two courses a year, usually with one at the undergrad level. Once you are in the dept, you have access to all the profs. Another way to work with a professor is through undergrad research, and you can start in your freshman year. How much time you get to meet the profs is entirely up to you.
