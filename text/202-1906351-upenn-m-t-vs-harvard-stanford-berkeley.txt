2.<<<Penn95>>>
@mlunghi  For undergrad Berkeley is not exactly equivalent to Harvard, Stanford and Penn.
Stanford and Harvard have more lay prestige (meaning for the general population) than Penn, but Penn M&T specifically  is just as prestigious in sophisticated business and tech circles and opens really amazing doors.
I feel if you are interested in business and engineering/technology the choice is down to Penn M&T vs Stanford. You should choose between these two mainly based on fit. The pros for M&T are incredibly individualized attention and guidance while at Penn, both for academics and internships/jobs - There is an M&T office at Penn dedicated only to the M&T students with many counselors, administrators etc. Also the M&T alumni network is super close-knit and there are alumni events very often where you get to meet and network with M&T alumni. Because of the super strong ties of the M&T alumni network , its small size and how successful its grads are, it can be a huge asset in recruiting for top jobs etc. Also Pen has the strongest undergrad business program in the world.
The pros for Stanford ae that it is  overall more prestigious, recognizable name,  has better location and is stronger in engineering than Penn.

3.<<<mlunghi>>>
@Penn95 how is the campus at upenn compared to the others?

4.<<<Penn95>>>
From a architecture standpoint, I think Stanford has the nicest campus. I think for the other three it comes down to personal preference as to which one is the prettiest.
In terms of location and practicality I like  the Penn campus best. The campus is in a big but not overwhelmingly huge city (like NYC for example). So you got all the offerings of a major city without feeling overwhelmed. Also it is not right smack in the city center but rather a few minutes on foot away from the city center. Also despite being close to the city center, Penn has a defined and separate campus, so there is a campus feel and community (we call it the Penn Bubble)  so you get the best of both worlds.
Harvard is also in a major city but it gets way too touristy for my taste.

5.<<<mlunghi>>>
@Penn95 if you dont mind me asking, are you a student? I’d have lots to ask aahahah

6.<<<Penn95>>>
@mlunghi I am an alum. sure ask away.

7.<<<mlunghi>>>
@Penn95 is Upenn as well known as other Ivies? In terms of financial aid, how generous is it to international students?

8.<<<Penn95>>>
@mlunghi Depends which other ivies you are comparing it to and also what your intended audience is (i.e. to whom it is well known). To top employers and top grad school programs around the world Penn is very well known and highly regarded.  In fact Penn grads have the second highest salaries in the ivy league after Harvard and top employment outcomes, Penn is very heavily targeted by all the top firms, more so than some other ivies.
Now when you are talking about lay recognition, prestige, it depends which ivy you are comparing Penn to. Harvard is obviously the most famous university in the world. Every random person on the street knows what Harvard is and will be  impressed. Also Yale and Princeton have more name recognition than Penn by the average person on the street, but of course less than Harvard. But after HYP, Penn has just as good or better name recognition by the lay public as the rest of the ivies.
Specifically the Penn M&T program is extremely prestigious in sophisticated business/tech circles and people routinely turn down even Harvard, Stanford and MIT to attend.
Amongst the ivies, only HYP have need-blind financial aid for internationals because their endowments are much bigger than the rest of the ivies. All the other ivies are need-aware for international students. This means that applying for aid as an international will affect your chances of getting in since they have more limited funds for internationals. Still there are many top international students who get great financial aid awards from Penn and other non-HYP ivies.

9.<<<mlunghi>>>
@Penn95 would you advise taking out a loan then, or applying for financial aid? I do not think i would need huge amounts of aid, but certainly some would be very helpful.

10.<<<Penn95>>>
@mlunghi So you mean not applying for financial aid at all at Penn? How much would you need in loans or aid?

11.<<<preppedparent>>>
Berkeley is world ranked university. Great undergrad experience

12.<<<mlunghi>>>
@Penn95 probably 40K in total for the 4 year degree, should I just take out a loan or is it worth applying for aid? I might even need less than that.

13.<<<Alexandre>>>
“For undergrad Berkeley is not exactly equivalent to Harvard, Stanford and Penn.”
For undergrad, Cal is not exactly equivalent to Stanford and Harvard…but then again, neither is Penn. Of course, both Cal and Penn can match Harvard and Stanford in their respective ways. For example, Cal’s undergraduate Chemistry, Computer Science, Humanities and Engineering programs match those at Harvard and Stanford. Penn’s Wharton Schoo, as well as its dual degree programs (Huntsman and Jerome Fisher) are truly exceptional, and impossible to beat for students interested in Business. But to suggest that Cal is inferior is way off base. Cal and and Penn are peers, and both are truly exceptional universities in their own way. They are admittedly very different from each other, and have their own strengths and limitations, but in terms of overall quality, they are in the same peer group.
mlunghi, you should be more specific. For example, in Silicon Valley, Cal and Stanford are extremely prestigious. On the East Coast, Harvard and Penn have the edge.
Also keep in mind that of those four universities, only Penn offers an Early Decision option. Harvard and Stanford have restrictive Early Action options and Cal does not have an Early Action/Early Decision plan.
Cal does not offer FA to international students, but it does scholarships to a lucky few. Honestly, I would not focus too much on Cal if you need a generous FA package. Harvard, Penn and Stanford all offer FA to international students, but Penn and Stanford are not known to be that generous with international FA. Dartmouth, Harvard and MIT are three that re typically more generous with international FA.

14.<<<mlunghi>>>
@Alexandre thank you very much for your reply! My main is to end up in technology startups, hence why I was looking at double degrees/majors in engineering and business. Harvard, Upenn, and Stanford would all allow me to do so. Do you think I should ED Upenn or wait for Harvard’s EA? This is my current plan, haven’t really looked at Darthmouth, how does it stack up against the rest?

15.<<<Penn95>>>
@Alexandre I don’t think that is quite true. As a undergraduate school Berkeley is not exactly a peer to the ivies, stanford,MIT. It has to do with being a state school, having much more limited resources per students, much bigger undergrad student body, oversubscribed classes etc. But as an overall research university, i.e. in terms of research output and most of its grad schools, Berkeley is truly top notch. I feel for Berkeley there is a discrepancy between its standing for undergrad vs for grad schools. For undergrad rather few people turn down the most of  ivies, Stanford, MIT, Chicago, Duke etc for Berkeley.
Dartmouth has stopped being need bind for international students because it could not afford it anymore. it is need aware as are Penn and Stanford.
@mlunghi You should apply ED to your first choice. If you are happy committing to Penn and you won’t regret it then sure go ahead, Penn favors its ED applicants quite a bit. But if you are going to regret not doing Harvard SCEA (there is no EA at Harvard), then you prob shouldn’t ED at Penn.
Regarding the financial aid, while 40k over the entire 4 years is not huge, it is also not negligible. This is something you need to think very well yourself and also discuss with your parents. Yes applying to Penn and Stanford for financial aid will slightly lower your chances of getting admitted but getting loans is also a big decision, even if they are not too big. Maybe since you need FA, Harvard SCEA would be the better option since Harvard is need blind for internationals.

16.<<<Alexandre>>>
“I don’t think that is quite true. As a undergraduate school Berkeley is not exactly a peer to the ivies, stanford,MIT.”
You think wrong Penn95. You should stick to what you know and leave university evaluations to the experts. They overwhelmingly agree that Cal is very much on par with Penn. What you and I think is irrelevant. Collectively, they know infinitely more than we do. We are literally ignoramuses compared to them. If you think otherwise (that you are wiser and better informed than hundreds of university presidents, provosts and undergraduate deans combined), you have delusions of grandeur.
“It has to do with being a state school, having much more limited resources per students, much bigger undergrad student body, oversubscribed classes etc.”
State universities are not all lacking in resources. Michigan and UVa are as wealthy as private elites on a per student basis and they never have oversubscribed classes. Cal may not be quite as wealthy, but it is not hurting. Most of the claims against it are blown out of proportion. And let us not forget that Cal has no medical complex draining its resources. If one were to go on this metric, schools like Notre Dame and Rice would be world beaters…certainly superior to Brown, Columbia, Cornell and Penn. But resources per student are not absolute. In fact, it is a well known fact in academic circles that the quality of an undergraduate institution cannot be captured, quantified or measured statistically. There are way too many variables, many of which are intangible, to assign a number to a university’s overall excellence.
“I feel for Berkeley there is a discrepancy between its standing for undergrad vs for grad schools.”
There is definitely a discrepancy. At the graduate level, Cal is #1 or #2. I never claimed it was as good at the undergraduate level. But you make it seem like it is not on par with Penn. That is not accurate, only your opinion.
“For undergrad rather few people turn down the most of ivies, Stanford, MIT, Chicago, Duke etc for Berkeley.”
Sadly, you are referring to highly misguided kids and their easily manipulated parents. You are quite right, most high school children and their parents are blinded by rankings which care only about sales and nothing for presenting a product that is grounded in fair, accurate, consistent and relevant information. Those in the know would not hesitate to choose Cal over schools like Chicago, Duke and Penn…if it suits their personal preferences and academic interests of course. Admittedly, Cal is not for everyone. Indeed, most either love it or hate it (for the record, I was admitted into Cal, and disliked it when I visited it). But those who love it wouldn’t have it any other way. Incidentally, when it comes to people interested in either initiating a startup or working for one, Cal is hard to match…let alone beat. But then again, so it Penn, and since Penn is more generous with FA than Cal, it obviously makes better sense for the OP to focus on Penn.

@Penn95 i honeslty do not even know if my family will be eligible for fa, what are upenn’s requirements? Upenn’s mnt is my first choice

18.<<<CaliDad2020>>>
wow @Alexandre someone hit a nerve.
@mlunghi
I have no idea what “par” is in colleges (and I rarely see it when I play golf either…) but I think it’s silly to make this decision based on school ranks and a bit of a mislead to suggest too strongly that the Cal undergrad experience will be very equivalent to a Penn M&T undergrad experience.
The Jerome Fisher at Penn is different even than being a “regular” Wharton or CEAS (SEAS?) student. It is very, very, very intense, time consuming and stressful. And it is vyer, very prestigious and gets a lot of university resources (and has it’s own little clubhouse building now, on Locust Walk.
For Cal, you don’t even know if you are going to be able to get into Haas until you are a student. You have to apply.
Now, a student who is up for the Penn M&T probably has a good shot at Haas, but it is not a lock.
Stanford, of course, is Stanford.  Harvard is Harvard.
But Penn M&T is a sure thing (if you get in and can/choose to stay in - it is not an easy program), Stanford will always be Stanford. Cal is very good, but the only guarentee you’ll have is whatever school/major you get in with and a business degree from Cal is a bit of a crap shoot.
At the end of the day all 3 will give you more resources than you can ever hope to use. The M&T, of course, gives you resources of 3 schools: Wharton, CEAS, CAS. Cal gives you the resources of a big, prestigious state school in shouting distance of Silicon Valley and Stanford gives you a suburban location that IS Silicon Valley.  Harvard is probably the international brand, lovely Boston location, hard to pick at it too much. Maybe just that Stanford and perhaps Haas are a touch more easier for Silicon Valley internships if that’s your dream.
Pick your poison. You can’t really go wrong.  If I was you I’d go on Facebook or Linkedin and try to hit up a few students from each school. You’ll do best where the program fits you best and no one tosses a resume from Penn/M&T, Harvard, Cal or Standford out based on the name of those schools.

19.<<<philbegas>>>
I just hope OP is picking some schools that are more realistic to get into. As an international student perhaps they are not aware that all of the schools being discussed are reaches even for perfect and diverse students.

@Penn95 " I don’t think that is quite true. As a undergraduate school Berkeley is not exactly a peer to the ivies, stanford,MIT. "
Again this concept of the Ivies as “they are all peers”,  they are not, they belong to the same athletic league but Dartmouth is not a peer to Harvard, only Yale Harvard and Princeton are peers.

21.<<<mlunghi>>>
@philbegas I definately will apply to easier schools too! Hows CS department at Upenn? @Penn95

22.<<<moscott>>>
Whether or not Berkeley is comparable to PENN is debatable(PENN is higher for undergrad imo) however there is NO debate that PENN M&T is well above Berkeley and might be THE finest program there is.

23.<<<CaliDad2020>>>
@mlunghi the CS/Design program is pretty special if you want to do animation/3D design stuff. Also if you want to pair it with Cog Science. Otherwise, it is very good, but there might be more special, depending on what you want out of it.
How are choosing your schools, anyway. All this ratings crap is crap. Don’t get caught up in it.
Who cares about a USNews ranking. You would not choose Yale business over Wharton or Dartmouth engineering over Cornell based solely on quality of program. But there are many other issues that go into choosing a University (or there should be anyway.)
So, question #1 is what are you looking for in a college/university, starting with “what can you/do you want to pay.”

24.<<<NashSaddle>>>
@CU123 I mean if we limit it to business, than the only peer schools are Harvard and Wharton…

25.<<<tk21769>>>
Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley and Penn are all well known (certainly among people very familiar with American colleges, but even among many who aren’t.)  They are all good. They are all prestigious.
Of the 4, only Harvard is both need-blind and claims to meet 100% of demonstrated need, even for international students. Whether this general policy difference will make a significant difference in the OP’s particular case is hard to say. They are all extremely selective even for US citizens. All 4 presumably are even more selective for international students. Berkeley, however, does not make institutional scholarship/grant aid available to international students (according to its 2015-16 Common Data Set, section H6).  So you might want to consider a less selective school (or even an equally selective one) that does offer financial aid to international students. The University of Illinois has respected CS and engineering programs and does offer some aid to internationals.  Many selective private universities grant fairly generous average aid amounts to the internationals they accept. For example at Cornell, for 2016-17, the average dollar amount of institutional financial aid awarded to undergraduate degree seeking nonresident aliens was $58,438 (according to its CDS).

[/quote]

For any college that interests you, you can get a rough idea of the net price (after aid) by running its online Net Price Calculator. The College Board has a site that allows you to save your family’s financial data and run it for many participating schools. (https://professionals.collegeboard.org/higher-ed/financial-aid/netprice). UPenn is a participating school.
Be sure to enter “none of the above” for your (and your parents’) state of legal residence and citizenship status. If it’s a participating college that does not grant aid to internationals, expect it to return “0” as the estimated grant aid (even if your family income is quite low). For a college that does grant aid to internationals (like UPenn), the estimates don’t seem to account for travel costs (as they do for out-of-state US citizens).  There may be other ways in which the NPC doesn’t work as well for internationals as it does for US citizens.

27.<<<Penn95>>>
@Alexandre First of all you need to calm down, lose the attitude and watch how you talk to people…secondly i am not going to waste my time convincing you of the obvious, it is rather rare for undergrad for people to choose Berkeley over the ivies, Stanford, MIT etc. That is a fact. It is also a fact that as a research university, it has a stronger reputation than all ivies other than Harvard and maybe Princeton. Berkeley grad/research and undergrad definitely do not have the same standing.
@CU123 It depends on what level of detail you are looking at. You know very well that the ivy league is much more than an athletic conference (most people dent even now it is an athletic conference). All ivies are more or less peers, but HYP are definitely more on par with each other than the rest of the ivies. But definitely for undergrad Dartmouth is more of a peer to HYP than Berkeley, If you want to get super anal about it than you could argue that Harvards true peer is Stanford, not Yale or Princeton. The ivy+ schools are essentially peers, of course not all of them have equal standing. Peers doesnt mean completely equivalent.
@mlunghi CS is strong at Penn. Sends many kids to top jobs and top grad schools and the program is rigorous with many cool courses.
Regarding financial aid, run the Penn NPC as mentioned above, but keep in mind it is primarily designed for US citizens. Also check out this info here about Penn International student financial aid. http://www.sfs.upenn.edu/paying/paying-international.htm

28.<<<CaliDad2020>>>
@mlunghi again, please don’t pick your college based on what some anonymous CC poster tells you is a “peer.”  Peers are for juries.
Identify what is important for you in an undergraduate college.
Identify what colleges have what is important for you.
Identify, of those colleges, which ones you can afford. (I don’t know your situation but many parents have told their kids “we’ll take care of it” - especially internationals who are used to college fees being more affordable. Then when they realize “we’ll take care of it” can mean “we’ll give you 280,000 US after tax dollars over the next four years no problem” they faint, and change their minds.)
Of the ones you can afford that have what is important to you, identify one or two you can for sure get into (your stats are solidly over the 75% mark)
Two or three that should be a good match (your stats are solidly over the 50% mark - and hopefully close to or at 75% for one or two of those.
And, if you want, as many reaches as feel like writing the essays and writing the checks - like any of the colleges you are listing. Any college with &lt;10 or even &lt;15% admit rate turn away loads kids with perfect scores every year. You just have to look at a couple of results threads for Harvard or Penn or Cal to find kids posting they are shell-shocked because they didn’t get in, despite perfect ACT or SAT, published books, sport champions etc.
But really, almost any US top 25, even top 50 University will have a ton of great resources and each will be stronger at different things and some good schools will be surprisingly poor at certain things (or you’ll get unlucky and get a crap prof - happens everywhere.) The more you can identify what is important to you in a school the better.

29.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
UCB now offers a direct admission business  and EECS or IEOR program (MET), probably to compete with the Penn and similar programs. The curriculum is full major and breadth in both, requiring overloading (about 150-160 instead of the usual 120 credits).
Not sure what the appeal is, though.

30.<<<Much2learn>>>
First, for those not up on Ivy League jargon, Penn’s M & T program (Management & Technology) is the same as the Jerome Fisher Program. The official name is “The Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology.” Posters are using these names interchangeably.
@calidad “How are choosing your schools, anyway. All this ratings crap is crap. Don’t get caught up in it.”
This.^
If you are fortunate enough to get into one of these options, you are very fortunate. If you are admitted to two, it is nearly miraculous. If that happens, choose the one where you think you fit in the best. That will be worth more than the modest differences in rankings.
If a company has resumes from similar students at those four schools, the only way they are going to know which one it the best coder is to have tech interviews and test them. They all have outstanding students and many that were admitted to the other three schools.
@mlunghi “Hows CS department at Upenn?”
Penn’s CS department is very good. CS is the largest major in SEAS. D1 is finishing junior year there now. In a few weeks she is off to CA for an internship at a top tech firm, just like most of the CS students at the other three schools you are considering. The Penn program is challenging, and definitely not for everyone. You need ability, focus, and resilience. I think that is true at all four of these schools though. You will not fake your way through any of these programs.
However, there is also a degree of flexibility with the Penn program that has allowed her to pursue some personal interests, and that makes it more interesting for her. She added a minor in math, and several STAT classes, (one class short of a minor at the moment), and also take coursework in an array of subjects, just because they “looked cool and interesting”: Astro-Physics, Classic Latin, Game Theory and Entrepreneurship. Penn is great for the career-focused student, who also has a lot of natural curiosity and broad interests. I am not sure she could have constructed the 4 years she has had at Penn anywhere else.

@Much2learn I want to study economics/finance and computer science/engineering, so i looked for schools that did so. Upenn, Harvard, and Berkeley seem to have strong departments in both, hence why I was looking at these, although rankings certaintly played a role too.

35.<<<tk21769>>>
@mlunghi, if you find college rankings helpful, by all means use them to identify more schools that are roughly comparable, in overall quality, to the ones you recognize. In my opinion, high quality extends well beyond the top 10.  In many departments of most colleges across the top 50 (or even the top 100), the credentials of most professors who frequently teach undergrads would be virtually indistinguishable. Some research studies have shown that college selectivity/prestige per se, at least among the top 100 or 200 schools, makes little or no difference to lifetime earnings of most graduates.
On the other hand, the higher-ranked schools generally are wealthier schools that can afford to grant more financial aid. Among universities in the US News top 20, apparently only Berkeley (#20) does not grant aid to internationals. In the next 10 (21-30), several do not grant aid to internationals. As you get into the next 10 after that (31-40), you begin to see universities (like NYU) that aren’t very generous with aid even to US citizens. Among the US News “national universities”, as far as I know, none ranked lower (worse) than Boston College (#31) even claims to meet 100% of demonstrated need for US citizens. A highly qualified individual may get a big need-based aid package at some lower-ranked schools … and top students certainly can get big merit scholarships at some much lower ranked schools.  However, it may make sense for a very strong international student with high need to focus on the top 40 or so, then search for true safeties in your home country.  I think the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle of that band (like, #11-#31).  The top 10 are admission crap shoots; in the lower 10 (#32-40), n-b aid to internationals may be insufficient.
For what you seem to want and need, it may make sense to consider Brown, Cornell, Harvey Mudd College (which is sort of a mini MIT), Northwestern, Rice, Tufts, the University of Southern California, Vanderbilt, and Washington University in St. Louis. These are all rich, selective, prestigious schools with strong STEM programs. As far as I know they all offer generous need based aid packages to internationals. However, they are not quite the admission crap shoots that Stanford and Harvard are (although a few come close). A bit less selective, but still very good:  URochester, Brandeis, Case Western Reserve University, Northeastern, Rensselaer, and Lehigh.

“First of all you need to calm down, lose the attitude and watch how you talk to people…”
Penn95, you insult 500,000 Cal alumni by claiming that Penn is superior to Cal, and I am the one with an attitude?   Did you stop and think how your words affect others? I am sure you do not appreciate it when others tell you that Chicago or Columbia are superior to Penn when there is no real evidence, other than statistical data, to support their claims. Try putting yourself in the shoes of others before you debase their alma matter. All I said is that you should not pass opinion as fact. That certainly goes for me too, and I am guilty of doing so from time to time. We really have nowhere near the experience, information or visibility into those matters as does the collective of university presidents, provosts and deans of undergraduate colleges. According to them, Cal undergrad is not inferior to Penn undergrad.
"secondly i am not going to waste my time convincing you of the obvious, it is rather rare for undergrad for people to choose Berkeley over the ivies, Stanford, MIT etc… that is a fact. "
There is nothing obvious about what you are trying to convince of. I am rather a reasonable person Penn95. If something is obvious or logical, I will wholeheartedly embrace it. You are basing part of your argument on the decision made by 17-18 year old high school kids. It hardly proves that Cal is not as good an undergraduate institution. There are many reasons why people may choose Ivy League schools over Cal. Better financial aid, ED commitments, legacy status, desire to move away from home, etc…That does not mean the undergraduate education received at Penn is superior to the one received at Cal.
I think there are two schools of thought when it comes to determining the quality of a university. One is grounded in the belief that the quality of an undergraduate education can be captured through a series of data points…that there is a statistical equation that can, with a degree of accuracy, predict the quality of a university’s undergraduate quality. Most high school students and parents like the statistical approach because it is tangible. The second is grounded in the belief that the quality of an undergraduate education cannot be captured statistically. In general, most members of academe do not ascribe to a one-size-fits-all statistical methodology. The article written by Gerhard Casper, a Yale educated Law scholar who served as Dean of the University of Chicago Law School (1977-1987), Provost of the University of Chicago (1987-1992) and President of Stanford University from 1992-2000) articulated what most members of the academic community feel, both about Cal being a top undergraduate institution, and about basing rankings on statistics.
https://web.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/97/970418usnews.html
“It is also a fact that as a research university, it has a stronger reputation than all ivies other than Harvard and maybe Princeton. Berkeley grad/research and undergrad definitely do not have the same standing.”
I don’t think it is a stretch to say that Cal’s graduate programs are in a different league to Cal undergrad. I have said as much already. When it comes to graduate programs, not including MBA or Law School, the only Ivy on par with Cal is Harvard. But Cal’s graduate programs are in a different league to Penn undergrad, or Northwestern undergrad, or Brown undergrad, or Michigan undergrad, or Cornell undergrad or Duke undergrad etc…Cal’s graduate programs are generally considered among the top 3 in the nation, along with Harvard and Stanford. Caltech ad MIT match Cal in the sciences and Princeton and Yale match Cal in the Humanities and Social Sciences. Clearly, Cal is exceptional at the graduate level, and it is a notch below at the undergraduate level. That does not mean that Cal undergrad is weaker than Penn undergrad. There is no evidence that the undergraduate education received at Penn is superior to the undergraduate education received at Cal.

37.<<<moscott>>>
@stevensPR   Parchment is a viable resource available to compare colleges like it or not. It’s not even close(81-19). Heck Berkeley only has a 58-42 vs UCLA. Do you have another source citing otherwise?

38.<<<CaliDad2020>>>
@mlunghi
If you are asking about my 75%/50% numbers those refer to the “admissions stats” of the schools. Most schools report to the “common data set” their acceptance stats, including the range of SAT and/or ACT scores. They report them as 25-75% (Basically if the school accepted 1000 students 250 have scores under the “low” number (usually athletes, alumni kids, other special admits for very unique other reasons than test scores) and 250 have above the “high” number (that’s where you want to be to feel you have a decent shot, although schools reject kids with top test scores all the time if the rest of their application is not interesting to the school.)
So Penn, for instance has a “basic” reported ACT 25-75 rangeof 32-35 (this # is actually their attending students which is a bit different than admitted students but close enough for jazz). Now, be aware this is for the entire undergrad university population. CAS (College of Arts & Sciences) and Undergrad Nursing will generally be tiny a bit lower on average, CEAS (Eng) and Wharton at the upper edge of this range and M&T (Jerome Fisher) will likely require (all else being equal) the very top range 35-36.
Basically, if you have less than a 33 on the ACT, and no really strong standout (and I mean by standout, really top notch, not just “best at my school” but “Best in City/State/Area/Country”) special skill/achievement, you’re going to need perfect grades, amazing recs, a pulitzer-level essay and a bit of luck to get into Penn.  30,000 students in the US score 33+ on the ACT each year. Add students who only take SAT and do well and there is a decent sized pool of strong test-takers out there for the Penn, Stanford, Harvard, Cal to select from.
(for reference Harvard reports a 25-75% ACT of 31-35, MIT 33-35, Cal 30-34)
But you have to look at that number not as “A 33 will get me in” but as “if I have less than a 33 I’m unlikely to even be competitive.”
Then you have to look at programs. One of my kids, for instance, had a 33 ACT, significant college research in a competitive program, good grades, lots of APs, etc. etc. and did not get into Cal. But she applied to an engineering major and at Cal the engineering is more competitive than the general L&S school. So, if you were interested in CS, for instance, you can apply to Cal Engineering CSEE, which is extra extremely competiitve, or just to Cal LibArts school to study CS, which is “just” extremely competitive.
Again, schools like Stanford, Harvard, Penn, Cal have very low admission % They are taking 6 or 7 or 12% of the applicants - and most applicants have already self-selected to at least be close to that 25-75 range. Not a lot of kids with 26 ACT scores or 3.5 GPA are wasting the time writing a Stanford or Penn supplimental essay. It is kids with 30, 31 and up. And still 1 in 10 get in. Also be aware Penn, for instance, takes a good % of its class as early admits, so if you are in the regular pool your chances go down further. Again CEAS and Wharton are even more competitive and M&T is perhaps the most competitive of all Penn undergrad programs.
Hope this helps. Let me know if  you need further info. But it is very dangerous, if you really want to go to a US school, to only have &lt;20% admit rate schools on your list. Penty of very smart and accomplished US students make this mistake every year and end up sweating wait-lists or having to scramble for a last minute option. If you understand math at all, you’ll realize the issue. UCLA got 100k apps last year. Harvard got ~ 40k for ~2k admits… etc.
(oh and PS, ignore @Penn95 and @Alexandre that’s just what happens when you go to a decent US school that isn’t Harvard or Stanford! lol…)

You may want to consider whether doing full majors in CS/E and business is really worth the trouble compared to doing CS/E with some out-of-major electives in economics and finance.
For elitist employment list Wall Street and consulting, school prestige is a big deal, regardless of major (note that many of the targeted high-prestige schools do not offer business majors).  CS/E may be helpful in some areas, of course.
For typical CS/E employment, a second major in business or even a large number of business courses may signal (negatively) to potential employers that you are less committed to CS/E than using it as a stepping stone to management or some such.

“Whether or not Berkeley is comparable to PENN is debatable”…
Moscott, I do not think it is debatable. There are very few people in-the-know that will dispute Cal’s place in the academic realm.
…"(PENN is higher for undergrad imo)…
That is perfectly reasonable. We are all entitled to our personal opinions. But that does not make it fact…or “debatable”. Just because it is your opinion, it does not make it so.
“however there is NO debate that PENN M&T is well above Berkeley and might be THE finest program there is.”
Jerome Fisher is a very interesting, if not unique, program. I am not sure that it can be labeled the “finest” since there aren’t many programs like it. If a person wishes to mix Business with Technology in a classroom setting, the M&T program is indeed amazing, but it is not for everybody. Most engineers I know would rather focus most of their efforts and attention on engineering. I am not sure that the M&T programs will give students an edge when it comes to post-graduation plans either. In what way is “well above Berkeley”. Do tech companies in Silicon Valley give preference to M&T graduates over Cal graduates? Do M&T graduates have a higher rate of success launching start-ups than Cal graduates? Is there a tangible way in which M&T graduates are deemed “well above” Cal graduates?
“Parchment is a viable resource available to compare colleges like it or not.”
Even  if that were the case, Parchment’s ranking have Cal at #15 nationally (#9 among research universities). Not a far cry from Penn, which is ranked #7 nationally (#3 among research universities).
“It’s not even close(81-19). Heck Berkeley only has a 58-42 vs UCLA.”
When last I checked, Parchment has some interesting figures. For example, Penn was favored over Cornell by an 87-13 advantage (worse than Cal), over Northwestern by an 88-12 advantage…and even over Brown by a 66-33 advantage. Perhaps a disproportionate number of applicants were interested specifically in Wharton, which would make sense. But as I have stated in a post above, student opinion does not make one university better than another. 80% of the students would choose Harvard over Princeton. Do you honestly think Harvard is that much better than Princeton?

Perhaps it may be better to consider one variable at a time.
Penn versus UCB:  There are probably significant regional differences in recruiting (i.e. Wall Street versus Silicon Valley).
M&T/MET versus CS/E by itself:  Not sure what type of work would favor an M&T/MET (or other CS/E + business double major) graduate over someone who graduated in CS/E.  Seems that these CS/E + business double major combinations are intended to sell the colleges to those who think that such a combination will help them rapidly climb corporate ladders.  But that can also send signals to employers that are not necessarily favorable to getting hired.

42.<<<stevensPR>>>
@moscott as I mentioned above, parchment has data from a group of high schoolers “admitted” to penn with a 26 average ACT.  This is literally imaginary data - you can’t seriously be this naive right?

43.<<<moscott>>>
^^^So you have no counter evidence right? Parchment isn’t exact but is indicative of supportive data based on actual results. Again Berkeley is a fine school but the majority of students accepted to both without financial consideration being the deciding factor would choose PENN. If you are going by the OP’s standards of Berkeley vs M&T it wouldn’t even be a close race as perhaps the top program in the country.

44.<<<stevensPR>>>
There are actual cross admit data report sites people are not privy too.  Here is one public one:
https://barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/2012_data_book.pdf
According to the above Barnard wins cross admits against NYU at a 85%+ clip consistently in the real world yet according to parchment only wins 66% of the time.
See Boston university where Barnard wins nearly 100% of the time.
@moscott you are dense

45.<<<stevensPR>>>
@moscott what actual evidence is that when the results are based on imaginary admitted students with an average ACT of 26?

46.<<<moscott>>>
What are you having a hard time with?
Methodology
This is a “revealed preference” tool. For each school’s percentage, the denominator includes all members who were admitted to both of these schools. The numerator includes those students who chose a given school. In other words, students who were admitted to both schools reveal their preference for one over the other by attending that school. To test for statistical significance at the 95% level, Wilson’s method is employed.

47.<<<stevensPR>>>
@moscott
So here is a step by step guide.
Go to penn’s profile.  Click on admitted students (which parchment uses to create its model)  See the average ACT?  It is a 26. Penn’s range for “real life” admitted students is a 32-35.  I guess in your world, doing statistical analysis on imaginary students is fine.

48.<<<philbegas>>>
According to Penn’s common data set, 90% of incoming freshman for 2015-2016 had a ACT score of 30-36 and 0% (or perhaps a statistically insignificant amount) had below 24. Not sure how that could translate to a 26

49.<<<stevensPR>>>
@philbegas
But for parchment admitted applicants to penn, it is a 26. I guess these must be real students!!
https://www.parchment.com/u/college/1519-University-of-Pennsylvania/profile

50.<<<moscott>>>
You need some reading comprehension…read the data used. Actual students admitted to both colleges and where they actually ended up. Believe it or not your choice but you have NO counter evidence…period.

51.<<<stevensPR>>>
@moscott cool I guess you are ok with using imaginary data.  I will take it to heart as truth when an admit with a 26 ACT says they got into penn and Harvard on parchment

52.<<<philbegas>>>
@stevensPR  Well according to Penn, 10% of admitted students had a 24-29 so it’s definitely possible, but not the norm.

53.<<<stevensPR>>>
@moscott Since you’re actually the one with a hard time with reading comprehension
From Parchment (http://www.parchment.com/blog/parchments-guiding-principles-for-data-analysis/0:
Learners engaging with these tools voluntarily share various data elements with Parchment including their GPA, SAT, or ACT score, and admissions outcomes to name a few. In order to bring insights to the admissions process, Parchment uses these learner-shared data, in aggregate, to provide analyses such as a user’s statistical odds of acceptance to a particular university.
So they use voluntary data from users such as this to create their statistical analysis:

Accepted to MIT and Penn and Brown with a 1080 - It is POSSIBLE!!!

54.<<<stevensPR>>>
@philbegas
When a website uses data on a group of students claiming to have gotten into Penn with a collective ACT of 26, would you trust that website’s data?

55.<<<moscott>>>
You SEEM to have a dog in this fight…I have none. What is your implication? There is actual evidence of kids being accepted to colleges then deciding which to attend. Is your contention that those admitted to both Berkeley and UPENN choose to enroll at Berkeley over UPENN? If so what is YOUR unfounded evidence?

56.<<<stevensPR>>>
@moscott
Tell me, what is the evidence Parchment uses to confirm students were admitted to the colleges?  Do they ask them for proof?
Did they ask this person below for proof?
http://www.parchment.com/c/college/view/?id=520887
The answer is no.  My beef is with anyone dumb enough to believe Parchment at face value or you.

@mlunghi “I want to study economics/finance and computer science/engineering, so i looked for schools that did so. Upenn, Harvard, and Berkeley seem to have strong departments in both, hence why I was looking at these, although rankings certaintly played a role too.”
I agree with you that rankings play a role too. I just mean that in your case, these are all top schools with strong CS results that are all excellent. At that point, what matters more what fits best for you.
@ucbalumnus “M&T/MET versus CS/E by itself: Not sure what type of work would favor an M&T/MET (or other CS/E + business double major) graduate over someone who graduated in CS/E.

This is a great question.
The jobs that these students can fit well for include startups where staff need to multi task, private equity positions working with tech firms, hedge funds need cs people who are knowledgeable about investments.
It is true that there are many positions where it would be better to choose finance or CS and gain more depth. However, even then M&T can be valuable. Some M&Ters will pursue both for a year and then decide that they would rather go deeper into one major or the other. Even in this case, it was valuable to have the extra year to consider their options and make a more informed choice for them. In the end, these students do very well in finding high paying jobs.

But would adding a full business major to CS/E be of much value than CS/E alone, perhaps with a few finance and economics electives?
Those school-elitist employers are said to be more major agnostic in hiring anyway, and many of their target schools do not offer business majors.

62.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Most of the people working in technical jobs at computer company startups have a CS background, though some have other backgrounds (occasionally no formal college at all) with self-education in CS.  However, business school backgrounds (including CS+business) are rare to non-existent among those working in technical jobs (as opposed to non-technical jobs like finance, accounting, marketing, etc.).
Some economics, finance, and other social science type courses may be interesting and useful, but adding a full business major probably not (and may send the wrong signal to some employers).

63.<<<Much2learn>>>
“But would adding a full business major to CS/E be of much value than CS/E alone, perhaps with a few finance and economics electives?”
Maybe. It really depends on the student.
I spent some time investigating this subject as D1 considered the exact two options that you are presenting at the end of freshman year. She was in SEAS as a CS major and doing very well. She needed to decide whether to apply to M & T or to stay in SEAS and expand her knowledge base.
I really don’t think that there is a right or wrong answer. In her experience, the M & T students tend to be very talented and have some valuable skills that many in CS are not very good at. For example, approaching a potential new product with a lot of focus on understanding the current market, and how this potential product’s characteristics compared to the competition. How is it different and better? What do customers want and need that they are not getting. How can we add those features?
They also are very skilled at marketing. In CS group projects she has observed that often an M & Ter will volunteer to prepare the presentation slides. At times she has been surprised at how impressive a thoughtful marketing person was able to make their product sound with a slick, visually appealing presentation and customer focus. Those are really valuable skills. Also, she has learned that the formality of a meeting where a finance team is presenting to investors often stands in sharp contrast to what passes for work attire and behavior in Silicon Valley. They sit up straight, the all wear nice suits, hair and makeup are perfect, everyone behaves very formally, they are incredibly well prepared, they are very careful not to interrupt potential investors/clients etc. Just the fact that as a SEAS student she has had the opportunity to observe all of this from her Wharton and M & T friends at a young age is really valuable in my opinion, and she clearly sees the value in these skills. To me it shows real value in the way Penn jumbles students together from all four schools. They all learn valuable things from one another.
However, she decided in the end that her primary focus, at least for now, would be more on technology and less on the finance and business aspects. She would not say that this is a better path than M & T, just better for her.
Instead of applying to M & T, she applied to a specialized CS program that is more focused on issues of connectivity, scaling, and systems engineering, and requires a bit more math and economics than your typical CS undergrad (www.nets.upenn.edu/). I know you will look it up if I don’t attach it. lol  The strong economics requirements bolster her economics knowledge as you mentioned. Then, to further bolster her depth of technology knowledge, at the end of sophomore year, she applied and was accepted as a sub-matriculant into the CS masters program. https://www.seas.upenn.edu/undergraduate/degrees/submatriculation.php
She is now splitting her course load between grad and undergrad courses, and hoping to graduate next May with a BSE and an MSE on the same weekend. If she is not able to manage the course load to do that, she will be one course short of her MSE at that time.
I should add that both the special program and the sub-mat require special applications, and the courses are difficult. Neither her path nor the M & T route are viable for an average student. Still they are both there and available for the right student who is bright, works hard and loves a challenge. While I don’t think there is a lot of initial monetary value in having the MSE over a BSE in CS, I do think the added depth of knowledge and experience with increased experience with significant projects is a valuable use of her time.

@ucbalumnus why would it be bad to employers? I mean maybe it wouldn’t provide an edge, but how would knowing more business hinder one’s adeptness for a job?

The problem, from an employer’s point of view, is that engineering or CS plus a lot of business courses or a second major (as opposed to a few electives) can signal that the person is mostly interested in climbing corporate ladders (using engineering or computing as a mere stepping stone) rather than being interested in making a career of engineering or computing.
Here is an example:

@mlunghi @ucbalumnus
I would never suggest “hiding” an interest by not taking courses/program of study because employers might think you have too much ambition. I would say that is a mistake. If you are, indeed, interested in engineering and management, there will be plenty of opportunities for that (it is less common now, but not that long ago a common refrain seemed to be "please, get me an engineer with social/management skills!) It may mean you are more attractive for different entry jobs, but many companies are looking for someone who can handle the tech side and also run a project. And not studying that, if you are interested and have the opportunity, is cutting off your nose to spite your face.
I can tell you with pretty strong confidence that all of the many Penn M&T grads I’ve known over the years have had a very easy time getting great gigs, despite their dual focus.

What @HPuck35 seemed to find in the linked threads from #64 was less ambition than self-entitlement.
Lots of people in technical roles move into management roles without having had a second major in business.

@stevensPR Why should anyone care that “Parchment says Penn’s average for accepted students used in the parchment profile is a 26.” when Penn’s common data set http://www.upenn.edu/ir/Common%20Data%20Set/UPenn%20Common%20Data%20Set%202015-16.pdf reports an ACT composite range of 31 (25%) - 34 (75%)? Are you suggesting that Parchment’s data is a more accurate reflection of the accepted student population than that reported in college’s official Federally required common data set filings?  Just took a look at some more of Parchment’s “data.” Harvard accepted students average: 25 ACT 1676 SAT. LOL. Think it’s clearly time to completely disregard all of Parchment’s “data” including their comparative choice numbers - which is kind of sad as there isn’t much else to go by.

Programs like M&T, MET,  etc,  are designed for students interested in creating their own start up;  they even have access to vc etc. The grasuates can also straddle two worlds that currently really want to meet by combining innovation culture and corporate culture,  not a small feet since in some ways those are built in opposition to one another.
In addition, ambition is not seen as bad in either culture and completing such a program signals incredible work ethics and excellent resilience, two characteristics that are quite attractive to employers.
They are not the End-all Be-all since you can find ways to build similar programs at various universities,  but the programs create a small cohort with extra contacts, networking opportunity, and a sense of belonging in a larger university.

71.<<<Penn95>>>
@mlunghi Penn M&T ED is as much of a crapshoot as Harvard EA, if not even more, so apply to your first choice so that u don’t have regrets.

72.<<<CaliDad2020>>>
@ucbalumnus @mlunghi I read the posts. Without any additional insight or info on my part they seem to me rather specific to the poster and anecdotal (and have a slight veneer of “pure” engineer snobbery.) It is well outside my area of expertise and I can only provide the counter-anecdotes of the M&T students I knew as well as other dual majors I know. (Not to mention the commonly seen lists of top CEO who are engineering BS/MBA grads.)
But I for sure stand by the basic idea: if you’re interested in both, and can handle the workload, I would not restrict that interest for fear of seeming “too ambitious” or for fear that you will become “entitled.” My guess is employers will recognized genuine business interest and talent (as well as genuine engineering interest and talent) a water will find its level.
Again, I would never suggest not studying something you are interested in because it may make you seem too ambitious. But that is just me.
