1.<<<TKatana>>>
I'm leaning more towards Berkeley right now but I'm feeling uneasy to decline Princeton cause you know, it's Princeton :P

2.<<<danceologist>>>
I have a friend at Berkeley. It definitely has a vibrant and social atmosphere--she is very involved with the activist aspect of the campus.

To be honest, I do not think you can go wrong with those choices. If for whatever reason you are drawn more to UCB, then I say you go with that.

Maybe someone on here can point out some more specific details to add to your pro/con list? I am at a loss because I know little about the engineering programs at either campus.

And by the way, congrats on having such amazing choices!! I wish you the best in all your future endeavors, regardless of which uni you choose.

3.<<<tk21769>>>
It does sound like Berkeley is a better fit for <i>you</i>, and that your reservations are largely about other people's perceptions (prestige).

4.<<<TKatana>>>
@tk21769 I came home today being set on Berkeley but when I talked with some friends who are at university right now, a lot of them told me the UC system is way too competitive and how you never get 1-on-1 time with professors. I started having doubts about Berkeley again after talking to them.

5.<<<luloobee>>>
My daughter had a similar choice (Notre Dame vs Penn -- Penn being viewed as the more prestigious of the two because of the Ivy designation). It's a tough choice, she finally positioned the question as "....if it weren't Ivy, would I want to go to this school". She went with her heart, ND.

6.<<<tk21769>>>
^^ It sounds like you need to sort out whether your reservations about Berkeley really are about objective differences that matter to you. How much 1-on-1 time with professors would you want? Usually you'll only get it if you seek it out. What does "way too competitive" mean, and how would it affect <i>you</i>?

7.<<<TKatana>>>
@tk21769 I guess I don't really mind not having 1-on-1 time with professors or being in a competitive environment as long as I commit myself to working hard. But I'm more concerned in the extracurricular aspect. Not having 1-on-1 time with professors means less opportunities with professors for research and more competition in the classroom also means more competition with other students for those research positions and for other internships. It would be hard to stand out in Berkeley when seeking for these positions.

8.<<<TKatana>>>
Bump, looking for more opinions. Conflicted again, just read some stuff about Berkeley' budget cuts (they're cutting 6% of faculty :/ ). I attended Cal Day, awesome atmosphere like I expected. But the large student body size in EECS worries me. I spoke to lots of current engineering students and a lot of them say I have to make a good effort to seek out research positions and internships. And I went to an EECS student panel and the room was packed @-)

9.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
I would not assume that it is all that easy to transfer in to Cal EECS as you seem to be doing.

Personally, I would pick Princeton if I was in your shoes as there is virtually no price difference.

10.<<<TKatana>>>
@PurpleTitan I spoke with some current students at Cal Day and they said if I had a 3.4 gpa in EECS courses I was basically guaranteed to transfer. I also spoke with another EECS student and told him of my situation and he said based on my accomplishments in high school, he thinks I wouldn't have a problem getting the gpa and switching. If I pick Berkeley, I'll be really determined to make the switch.

11.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Bringing in @ucbalumnus, who knows Cal better.

I just had the impression that switching in to EECS is very difficult at Cal.

Don't understand why you would chance it when you have Princeton where you may easily go in to any major and would open other doors and is smaller at no extra cost.

12.<<<insanedreamer>>>
I'd choose Princeton:
- smaller classes &amp; smaller school, more attention, potentially more research opportunities
- guaranteed into the major of your choice
- academics/reputation basically on par with Cal (technically ranked lower than engineering but not statistically significant difference)
- better undergraduate focus than Cal (which is a better grad school than undergrad)
The cons are not significant:
- AP credits won't matter as much with an engineering degree with have so many required courses anyway (my D in engineering can't use all of hers for that reason and won't be able to graduate early anyway)
- As for the atmosphere, maybe you just visited Princeton on a slow day :)

13.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Would you be fine doing ME if you did not get into EECS (or L&amp;S CS) at Berkeley? That is probably one of the biggest factors to consider in your decision.

Liberal arts includes math and science as well as humanities and social studies. Note that all ABET-accredited engineering degree programs, whether at Berkeley, Princeton, or some other school, will require some humanities and social studies course work. Both schools also have a non-engineering version of the CS major, but (unlike Brown or Amherst) do have humanities and social studies requirements for those students as well.

Yes, Princeton has smaller classes, but the popularity of CS means that they may not be that small. E.g. the introductory CS course at Berkeley (CS 61A) may have around 1,000 students, while the one at Princeton (COS 126) may have "only" 500 students.

The on-line schedules show class sizes.

14.<<<TKatana>>>
Bump, 1 other consideration I want to add is I probably will apply for grad school (masters probably, maybe phd?)

@ucbalumnus I don't think I'll be ok doing ME as opposed to EECS, however that is my 2nd choice major so it's not like I completely hate it. But if I go the Berkeley route, I will study 24/7 if I had to just to make the switch. Also if I go to Berkeley, I'm planning on going over the entire CS61A course over summer on my own and taking a bunch of released practice exams from the class. I'm going to try to aim for a 4.0 :P that might be impossible but I'm trying to develop a motivated mindset :)

15.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Opinion and recommendation doesn't change. Thinking that Princeton engineering is below Cal engineering at the undergrad level is simply wrong.

16.<<<TKatana>>>
@PurpleTitan I feel like I would be more successful and have more opportunity at Princeton, however I like Berkeley's atmosphere and location better. I don't know which I should choose... Both options aren't extremes though, I don't completely hate Princeton's atmosphere and I would certainly still have opportunities to be successful at Berkeley.

17.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
But you're basing Princeton's atmosphere off of one visit.

That seems like a dangerously thin reed to base an argument on.

18.<<<touchdream>>>
I would vote for Berkeley just for the location !!!

19.<<<TKatana>>>
@PurpleTitan Yeah that's something else I'm worried about, because I don't truly know how Princeton would be like. But I feel like I wouldn't enjoy a small student body in general or the cold weather. But I don't know if I should prioritize that so much. I used to tell myself not to worry about that kind of stuff when I was deciding what colleges to apply to but now I actually have to make the decision. I enjoyed Berkeley both times I visited though. It wasn't so much the weather (it was dark and rainy the first time I visited :P ) but just the amount of people around. There were just a lot of people everywhere even at midnight it made everything seem more lively and fun.

20.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
[quote]<a rel="nofollow" href="/profile/TKatana">TKatana</a> wrote:[/quote]

Just to make sure you know beforehand, you are probably looking at a few different college GPA thresholds to meet if you attend Berkeley:

a. whatever is needed to switch to EECS (probably very high).
b. 3.3 in CS 61A, 61B, 70 to declare L&amp;S CS major (note: 2.5 overall needed to switch to L&amp;S).
c. 3.0 to retain Regents' scholarship (probably $8,000 or so better than normal financial aid if you otherwise have high financial need as a California resident).

Note: <url>https://schedulebuilder.berkeley.edu/explore/department/SP/2016/53</url> indicates that, in recent history, about half of students in CS 61A earned B+ or higher grades; this is slightly higher for CS 61B but slightly lower for CS 70.

21.<<<prezbucky>>>
OP, many Princeton students choose to join an "eating club." Some of these are open to anyone while others are by admit only.

Those who wish to join one of the "admit only" clubs take part in what is known as "bicker." I'm not sure of everything that goes into it but I think it at least includes some sort of Q&amp;A session with club leaders. They "interview" you, after which you are either offered a spot or not.

Anyway, a goodly number of Princeton students join an eating club. They typically take their meals there, spend time studying there, play games, socialize, etc.

Eating clubs also throw parties, some of which are open to all students. The eating club could be said to be the epitome, the centerpiece, of Princeton's social scene. (Kind of like the residential colleges at Yale or the final clubs at Harvard)

Those who choose to avoid eating club membership may remain with the regular housing.

22.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Princeton eating clubs do have some similarities to fraternities and sororities, but also have some differences (like being coed and non-residential). Princeton discourages students (and prohibits frosh) from joining actual fraternities and sororities which exist as unrecognized off-campus organizations. Some background: <url>https://www.princeton.edu/reports/2011/campuslife/obs-rec/fraternities-sororities/</url> .

23.<<<TKatana>>>
@ucbalumnus you've been giving really good advice lately, I really appreciate it :)
You seem very unbiased and I think you're opinion would be very valuable. I was wondering, with all atmospheric preferences aside, which school would you personally pick?

24.<<<TKatana>>>
One thing I thought about is what if I transferred from Princeton to Berkeley after two years. Like if I didn't like Princeton after 2 years and I applied to Berkeley engineering as a transfer. Would I be admitted really easy (assuming I have a decent gpa) because I go to Princeton?

25.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Not sure about easy but it's easier than the other way around.

26.<<<TKatana>>>
I think I will be choosing Princeton now. Bumping for final opinions, I will be submitting SIR Tomorrow night.

27.<<<Redtor>>>
Take the Berkeley offer. When it comes to engineering, CS and technology (I'm talking about prestige, respect amongst the people in the field, employment opportunities, respect amongst the academicians, research opportunities, quality of research being conducted, and so on), Berkeley is a solid top 3 in the world. You should not undermine that.

28.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
[quote]<a rel="nofollow" href="/profile/TKatana">TKatana</a> wrote:[/quote]

Probably not. Transfer priority at UCs goes to students from California community colleges.

According to <url>http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/transfer-admissions-summary</url> , in 2015, Berkeley admitted 34% of transfer applicants with 3.60-4.00 GPA. Presumably, it will be harder if you apply to transfer to a popular major like EECS.

29.<<<WISdad23>>>
Gap year? Just kidding of course. Go to Princeton. If you can handle engineering you can handle 4 winters. NJ winters are considered mild relative to some areas. Constant sun and fun are not very conducive to academics. That is why most good schools have miserable weather.

30.<<<MYOS1634>>>
You're not comparing Berkeley EECS with Princeton BSE CS. You're comparing Berkeley ME to Princeton CS. The EECS threshold is VERY high. If you have to work day and night to get into it, with no guarantee you will, the social environment will be wasted on you as well as the opportunities, and yes why in the world would an EECS professor let you do research for him when you're not even in that track? Registering for EECS classes for example is not going to be easy due to the cuts and due to your not being in EECS.

Note that you simply can't transfer into Princeton. And transferring to UC's will put you in line behind CC transfers, but at least from a top 4-year university you hav a shot. Into EECS though, it becomes really complicated.

31.<<<washugrad>>>
I think you are getting a lot of good advice and have 2 great options to pick from. I'm just going to chime in about getting to know professors at Berkeley. Maybe not always true, but just make a habit of going to the professor's office hours as much as possible for your huge lecture classes. Believe it or not, not a lot of kids go to them (generally speaking)... they are more likely to get help from the GSIs (TAs) because they are more approachable. But if you show up for office hours.. even if you pretty much get the material and just have a minor question or two, they will remember you. Also if you are in a class where the prof is mandated to grade on the curve and your grade is on the border, they are likely to bump you up rather than down if they know you've been making that effort.

32.<<<Mastadon>>>
@ucbalumnus - Could you help interpret this?

Is it only the "engineering undeclared" pool that this policy applies to , or is it all transfers internal to engineering (i.e from ME to EECS)?

[quote]Freshmen applicants may also consider applying to the College of Engineering as Engineering Undeclared. This path allows engineering undeclared students who maintain a minimum of 2.0 GPA easy transfer at the junior year to any major in the College of Engineering major.[/quote]

<url>https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Programs/two_ways.html</url>

33.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Only CoE undeclared students have free choice of major within the CoE. Those entering as declared majors in the CoE have to apply to change major within the CoE, generally requiring a much higher GPA than 2.0 be allowed to do so (due to the popularity of EECS, it can be very difficult to change into EECS).

It used to be that switching to L&amp;S (which requires a 2.5 GPA) and declaring the L&amp;S CS major was a much easier way to get into a major to study CS. But the rapid rise in popularity meant that the GPA minimum for L&amp;S undeclared students to enter the L&amp;S CS major was raised from 2.0 to 3.0 a few years ago, and was more recently raised to 3.3 -- probably still easier than getting into EECS, but still a significant risk of not being able to get in.

34.<<<Mastadon>>>
Tough decision...

Princeton and UCB generate about the same number of research related awards, yet Princeton's CS department is less than half the size of UCB. This would suggest (but not prove) that there is more student-professor interaction for research at Princeton than UCB.

UCB tends to be known for the applied or practical nature of their research which is more important to industry than to academia.

From my perspective UCB and Princeton CS are as different as their cultures.

I associate Princeton with Alan Turing and John von Neumann and a strength in algorithms and I associate UCB with a strength in Architecture and AI and a number of innovations that have resulted in major advances in the computer industry.

Do you prefer a more "mathy" theoretical approach to CS, or a more "applied" theory approach?

Do you like systems level software or application level software?

How much do you want to get involved with the hardware aspect of computers?

35.<<<TKatana>>>
Thank you guys all for the advice! I read each and every response very carefully and really appreciate the advice. @Mastadon I prefer a more hands-on and applied learning rather than theoretical (I know Princeton is more focused on theoretical but it's not a big deal). I do also like the hardware aspect of computers (I want to code and be able to engineer). If I go to Princeton I think I can get an Electrical Engineering certificate (Princeton doesn't offer minors but certificates are kinda like minors) to supplement my CS.

I want to post my final updated Pro/Con list here. I will be making my final decision tonight. I am still strongly leaning towards Princeton, but I will appreciate more opinions (I would really appreciate unbiased opinions)

Berkeley:

Pros:
- Closer and nicer weather
- Near silicon valley, internships should be easy to get?
- High ranks in engineering
- Regents scholarship
- More social and lively
- Lots of AP Credit (Almost received max)
- Less liberal arts?

Cons:
- Large class sizes and large population (less opportunities for research and internships)
- Was admitted as MechE so I have to switch into EECS (Must maintain a 3.4+ gpa in EECS courses is what I've been told at Cal Day). Needing to switch would degrade my first year by adding extra stress and less opportunities in EECS department since I'm technically not EECS yet.
- Experiencing budget cuts
- Tough to get high GPA (lots of competition)
- Expensive to live in silicon valley/bay area (if I work there after)

Princeton:

Pros:
- #1 Undergraduate teaching (5k undergrads and 2k grads as opposed to Berkeley's 27k undergrads and 10k grads)
- Ivy Prestige and connections (alumni network)
- Not bad for engineering (best out of the ivy leagues)
- Admitted as B.S.E. Computer Science and can easily change major to anything I want
- Small class sizes (more contact with professors), Princeton's entire CS department is only about 200 per graduating class and 800 in total while Berkeley is about 700 per class and 2800 in total (counting both CS and EECS majors).
- Highest endowment/student in the country
- CS department is growing (I heard it's the most popular major at princeton right now)
- Can get good letter of recommendations for grad school

Cons:
- Weather is not as nice as Cal, also I live 2 hrs from Berkeley so Princeton is much less convenient to travel to.
- I liked Berkeley's atmosphere and campus better, however Princeton wasn't bad (a justifiable sacrifice since I would get more help and professor time at Princeton)
- Can't come home as often (expensive plane tickets)
- Engineering is not as good as Berkeley
- I don't really like liberal arts
- AP credits don't apply as much
- Less desirable testing schedule (not a major concern but finals are after winter break however we get 9 days of "reading period" where we have no classes and we just study for finals.

36.<<<Mastadon>>>
I am not a huge fan of the Princeton culture, and I like UCB's approach better given your interests, but.....

At the undergrad level, I am not a fan of "full immersion" in a pure technical discipline. Exposure to some liberal arts courses and non-programmers/engineers will pay dividends especially in the latter part of your career. I also think it is important to have some flexibility to explore without running into blockades at departmental boundaries.

So, I would recommend that you go to Princeton undergrad, develop a broad technical base, get some exposure to the liberal arts, and decide which technical area you want to specialize in. Then I would recommend that you go to UCB for your masters and immerse yourself in that specialty.

37.<<<MYOS1634>>>
The main sticking point for me is that you DIDN'T get the major you want at UCB whereas you DID at Princeton. I'd withstand some snow if it meant studying what I want to study and get to the career I want. What's the sun worth if you can't study what you'd like and are stuck in a career or major you haven't chosen? Heck, who knows, you may end up liking the snow. :)

38.<<<Redtor>>>
From what i know, Regent Scholars have always had a quite successful rate in shifting out and transferring to a program of their choice. Regent Scholars have an assigned mentor who constantly provide advice, guidance, and information about how the students can maximize the university's more than ample resources. So, basically, you get the same treatment and perks you're expecting to get from attending a top private school.

OP, do you know the benefits of being a Regent Scholar at Berkeley? I guess you should try to investigate about it more, because it seems the issues and worries you have about attending Berkeley do not impact the Regent Scholars, in general.

39.<<<Redtor>>>
Here are some of the benefits and advantages you'll get for being a regent scholar:

professor mentorship (from day one)
priority enrollment
Guaranteed student housing (throughout undergrad years)
Recommendation from profs (which you'd need when applying for grad school or seeking employment)
Research participation priority
research grant for Regent scholars
Study abroad priority
There will be a career event exclusively for regent scholars
And you will be part of Berkeley's Regent alumni which includes many very successful and highly influential people.

40.<<<TKatana>>>
@Redtor I know the objective perks like housing and priority enrollment but those would be offered at Princeton automatically. I was really trying to search for advantages for internship/research opportunities and stuff like that other than money and priority enrollment because that's one of the main reasons I'm choosing princeton--the connections and opportunities. I couldn't find anything on google about that so I asked on the facebook regents group page. From the responses I got it didn't seem like regent scholars have much of a "leg-up" when it comes to research/internship opportunities. There are like 2 exclusive fairs out of the whole year I think. And the people that responded kinda dodged my question so it seemed like there wasn't much the scholarship offered other than money, housing, etc.

Also do regents really get priority for research opportunities? I didn't read anything about that and nobody in the facebook group said that was true when I asked that question.

41.<<<Redtor>>>
OP, you'll get mentorship from the moment you enroll in the university and that continues until you graduate from your program. Your mentor can hook you up with some people you're interested in knowing or looking forward to working with. That's part of why they're there for you, in the first place.
I have never heard anyone complained about a poor handling of student mentorship from a regent scholar. On the contrary, i've occassionally heard a few of them not really being interested in seeking for advising because they're basically contented with what they have, or they've already mopped out their whole college journey on their own. Or their peers and clubs (they've joined in) are deeply supportive of them, or they've already have close connection with their favorite prof, etc.. Only goes to show college advising is applicable to some but not all. At Berkeley, you'll definitely get it when you need it. It's a myth that advising at Cal is next to impossible. It's just that not too many students there are interested in doing it. But it's always there.

Re research involvement, there are tons of high-quakity research being conducted in the college, more so, in the university, as a whole. Those students who show interest in a particular research are the priorities. Getting involved in research is not really the main issue for some students in CoE. The main issue is often whether they're able to get into the research team of their choice. And this is often the same issue faced by students at many research powerhouses, i suppose including Princeton. Generally, a research team in CoE is composed of only 8 to 15 students, which often includes grad/postgrad students. But, if your prof know you as you've been showing interest in his/her work, chances are he/she will accommodate you even when you've failed to make the cut in the selection process.

The main point here is showing interest in research involvement. If you want to get involved in research, you need to show to your prof your interest in the work that he's been doing. You need to demonstrate your capability to carry out such an important role that you'll be handling once you've been selected for the team. This is true at all research powerhouse schools, including Princeton. Do not assume the profs at Princeton are the ones courting their undergad students just so they can complete their research team. That is a mistake. The only advantage I can see Princeton has over Berkeley is you'll have lesser competition for every team. But Berkeley has got more research teams to choose from. And, i would assume the research quality is of higher standard given Berkeley CoE is a solid top 3 in America, if not the world. So, in case your first choice team is already full, there will be other teams that will be open for you.

42.<<<Redtor>>>
Look, i am not selling Berkeley to you. Either way, you'll end up in a great university. Princeton has been consistently ranked number one for undergraduate teaching in America. There is no question that it is an excellent school. It is. Your problem has become complicated because you've also been accepted to the 3rd best engineering school on earth, an area of your interest and where it beats Princeton. In addition, the 3rd best engineering school is also offering you additional perks and privileges. And, this is where i came in -- I wanted to help you understand more of these added benefits, which you seemed to have overlooked.
To be honest with you, if we're not talking about engineering here and you're not regent recipient, i would have recommended Princeton right away. But the people in the engineering and tech world, in general, whether in America or outside of America, are aware that Berkeley, along with MIT and Stanford, are the top of the heap, the best of the best. So, if you're dead set on having a career in this area, you should not undermine that fact.
Good luck. You'll be more than fine wherever you'll end up at.

43.<<<coolweather>>>
^ The OP already committed to Princeton in another thread.

44.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
And you can trot out grad and research rankings, but going to Princeton for undergrad simply isn't going to disadvantage anyone entering CS or engineering.
