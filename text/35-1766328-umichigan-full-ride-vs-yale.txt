Well, there you have it. D has the top merit scholarship at UMich, and for in-state (we are) it is a true full ride. We do not have final FinAid numbers from Yale yet, but let's assume it would be a stretch. Her major is Neuroscience. Definitely grad school in her future, but unsure if Med or PhD. Please give input; I'm dying here.

2.<<<blue85>>>
"Her major is Neuroscience."

Random thoughts as they occur. Michigan's program may not be #1 in neuro, but it is close. Michigan has a great med school for both primary care and for med research. Michigan has great track record for getting kids into medical school as well. UM med. has a student body with an elite profile. Yale is Yale and would be a great credential for anyone who stops short of professional credentials and the undergrad degree would certainly be more well known than Michigan. At the professional level the difference in reputation is probably not that large though Yale would still hold an edge.

Possible considerations: Michigan is building a new $260,000,000 bio building, a new $160,000,000 pathology building and may actually be larger than Yale in terms of NIH money (would have to research). Michigan has also poured about 1,000,000 sq/ft in concrete for life sciences facilities since the year 2000 and may have some of the best such facilities in the country. Michigan is also very heavy on the technology and engineering side as well as big on forming collaborations between/among schools (biomedical engineering being an example. Last thought on facilities: Michigan bought 1,700,000 sq/ft from Pfizer...pretty much state of the art labs and now home to a giant health policy institute...one of the largest in the country.

Bottom lines, Yale has immediate global brand recognition; there are no limits at Michigan for a bright student and the resources are almost unlimited, the brand recognition is probably not comparable.

Thanks @ClueBus !

Have you run the NPC yet for Yale? It should be similar, given that the financial situation remained same from the previous years.

If the cost is not too over-burdening, I would choose Yale. I know a friend who I've met during the Shipman Weekend already committed to Yale. Also, don't forget to ask your child!

4.<<<Alexandre>>>
Yale is a top 5 university, while Michigan is a top 15 university. Michigan's academic and reputational peers are Cal, Cornell, Duke, Northwestern and Penn, while Yale's peers are Harvard, MIT, Princeton and Stanford. In other words, Yale is only a tiny notch above Michigan.

Is Yale worth the extra cost? It depends on your financial situation. Generally speaking, I do not think Yale is $200k better than Michigan. I do not even think it is $50k better than Michigan. The difference in quality between Michigan and Yale is truly insignificant. There isn't a single door that Yale can open that Michigan cannot open just as easily.

Plus Ann Arbor is way nicer than New Haven! ;)

5.<<<billcsho>>>
When Pfizer shut down at Ann Arbor, most employees were reluctant to relocate to New Haven. Perhaps that may tell you something. I just happen to have a PhD in Neuroscience and know quite a few faculties doing research in that area at UMich. Although I don't know much about the undergraduate program in Neuroscience, the research there are really great. The director of the Molecular Behavior and Neuroscience Institute is one of the former presidents of the Neuroscience Society which is among the largest biological scientist organisation with 30,000+ people attending their annual meeting from all over the world every year. UMich also encourage undergraduates to do research. One way is through their UROP program. You may also use UROP as work study if eligible. So your D will be well prepared no matter which route she will take afterward.

6.<<<onceuponamom>>>
If your daughter is not head over heels for Yale (and maybe even then), I would go with Michigan. What an amazing scholarship!

7.<<<Musicmom2015>>>
@cluebus I feel your pain! We had to make a very similar choice. For us, the MI scholarship was closer to full tuition than full ride, but still wonderful. My S also had a few other merit awards at other schools, but this was his top choice among them. When he came home from Shipman weekend I could see him saying he should go there/consider it/ whatever. I said, l'm glad you liked it, let's see what happens this week with the remaining schools. My concern all along was the fit, as everyone on cc says is so important. His dream school all along was Yale. Yale and Michigan are very different! I know that he could get an excellent education at either school. Are the "benefits" of Yale worth the cost? For us, we decided it was. It pained me to pass on $$ but my gut feels he will be much happier at Yale. I'm happy to PM you with details if you like. But, if you are still really unsure, maybe send her to bulldog days next week so she can compare them? Has she visited Yale? Does she love it? If she is ambivalent, then go with Michigan. Good luck!!

8.<<<eyo777>>>
If she's considering grad school, might be wise to save money.
However, I know in the hard sciences, such as physics, it is possible to get into a top notch PhD program with a full stipend. I'm not sure how it is with neuroscience. It would be a good thing to look up.
I'm not especially familiar with med school plans. I think for that, most people save up.

I second what onceuponamom and Musicmom2015 say. The money might definitely be worth it for a more subjective benefit, such as if Yale has been her dream school since childhood and going there would make her extremely happy. If she also wants to stop her education at undergrad for any reason, then going to a top 5 school would most likely be better than top 15.

I just applied as a transfer student for Fall 2015 and am heavily considering UMich, so for what it's worth, I can provide a bit of input on my decision process:

Since I'm primarily self-driven, I'm positive that I can do well practically anywhere, given sufficient resources (whatever schools I applied to--all in the top 100--I would seriously consider attending, which is why I applied in the first place). I don't really have a "dream school" or preference for undergrad amongst those schools. I'm rather very oriented towards "what would get me where I want to be the most efficiently."

Since I'm OOS for all (except one last-choice backup) and I applied to mostly private institutions, I expected to pay a full 55-65k/year no matter where I went. As a junior transfer, I was bracing for it. I got a full-tuition gift surprise from Michigan, the first school I heard back from, and though I still have apps pending for some peers like UPenn and Cornell, I decided that I would rather not be hard on my parents and myself in terms of money, and I would only consider acceptances from these schools if they offer similar packages.

I have plans to get my PhD at Caltech, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, etc. I'm still not sure what subfield of physics I'm interested in, so I need a lot of research experience. What Michigan offers me--as well as other schools like Hopkins and Cornell--all already might be more than I can even take advantage of, and no matter where I go, I'm striving to be at the top. Living without worry of student loans and debt while still attaining my future goals sounds like a dream come true.

Perhaps your D might consider the same. You said she has plans of continuing her education, so she definitely has another shot at Yale for grad school.

It is ultimately up to her, though. In terms of facilities, your D really can't go wrong at either place, so you both should primarily consider "fit" and finances.

9.<<<gratefulalum>>>
I have a different take on it. If you can afford it after the financial aid from Yale, she should go there. First, it would be great for her to leave Michigan and be exposed to some of the brightest people in the world in a different part of the country. No one can deny the prestige of Yale, and it has opened many higher doors than Michigan has (there are exceptions, of course). Second, she would be in a non-Big Ten football school environment. It is much more academic there. As this year has proven, football is number one at U of M, especially for the undergraduates. Third, if she is unhappy there but does decently, she should be able to transfer anywhere, including to U of M. Fourth, if she does well there, she will able to get into most graduate and professional schools, including Michigan's renowned graduate and professional schools.

10.<<<Alexandre>>>
"I have a different take on it. If you can afford it after the financial aid from Yale, she should go there."

There is affording, and then there is affording. Which one does the OP fall into? If the parents can afford it without burden, then I agree. But if they can afford it with difficulty and personal sacrifice, I do not think it is worth it. Yale is amazing, but Michigan is only one tiny notch below. The difference is really insignificant.

"First, it would be great for her to leave Michigan and be exposed to some of the brightest people in the world in a different part of the country."

That makes sense, although I am not sure one needs to spend $250,000 for that experience. Her daughter can easily find a job outside of Michigan when she graduates, and she will be getting paid to do so.

"No one can deny the prestige of Yale, and it has opened many higher doors than Michigan has (there are exceptions, of course)."

Prestige? yes, although Michigan is not slouch in that department either. Opening more (or higher) doors? No. There isn't a door that Yale can open that Michigan cannot open as easily or efficiently.

"Second, she would be in a non-Big Ten football school environment. It is much more academic there. As this year has proven, football is number one at U of M, especially for the undergraduates."

That does not even make sense. Yale is not more "academic" or "intellectual" than Michigan. Both are about the same. Michigan has an additional dimension when it comes to athletics, but that does not take away from the academic rigor of the university, it merely adds to the University's campus life. Those who wish to ignore athletics altogether, and many choose to do so, can go happily about their business. Schools like Duke, Michigan, Notre Dame, UNC, Stanford etc...are perfectly capable of running successful athletics programs without compromising their academic/intellectual atmospheres. At Michigan, academics, not football, is number one.

"Third, if she is unhappy there but does decently, she should be able to transfer anywhere, including to U of M."

Nobody should go to a university with the thought of transferring.

"Fourth, if she does well there, she will able to get into most graduate and professional schools, including Michigan's renowned graduate and professional schools."

Same with Michigan. Michigan enrolls 50 students into its own Medical school every year. That is very significant considering how good Michigan Medical School is. Michigan also enrolls 3-5 students into most other top 20 medical schools annually.

11.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
I constantly hear about the great financial aid that top elite private schools are affording students. Where's the money from Yale? I'm sorry, but Yale is not worth tens of thousands of dollars/year more for a STEM degree over a school the caliber of Michigan. Actually IMHO, a substantial additional expense isn't worth it for any undergraduate degree from Yale unless the family can easily afford the difference.

12.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
" As this year has proven, football is number one at U of M, especially for the undergraduates."

That is a preposterous statement. Academics are number one at Michigan. It seems you are undervaluating, like so many here on CC, the overall academic excellence of the school. Even Yale isn't as strong across the board as Michigan in its offerings, i.e. engineering.

13.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
" As a junior transfer, I was bracing for it. I got a full-tuition gift surprise from Michigan, the first school I heard back from, and though I still have apps pending for some peers like UPenn and Cornell, I decided that I would rather not be hard on my parents and myself in terms of money, and I would only consider acceptances from these schools if they offer similar packages."

Intelligent decision eyo777. It seems Michigan has already started to offer more full scholarships then ever before. This is probably the result of the current Victors for Michigan campaign. As more top students get larger financial grants from the school, I assume we'll be hearing more about top students attending Ann Arbor who might not have in the past. The future for the University of Michigan is very exciting!

14.<<<Hunt>>>
I'm a Yale alum and a Yale parent, and my wife majored in MB&amp;B at Yale and went to Duke Med--so there's my bias. I would still say that Michigan is the choice if the cost difference is large enough as to be burdensome to your family. What "large enough" means is really up to you to determine. If the costs were equal, and other things were equal, I'd say go to Yale, because I think it provides a really terrific educational experience.

But there is no bad option. Congrats.

15.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"If the costs were equal, and other things were equal, I'd say go to Yale, because I think it provides a really terrific educational experience."

Totally agree as long as the student likes the school of course.

16.<<<Hunt>>>
Certainly--these schools are really close in overall quality, and anybody who prefers Michigan would be entirely reasonable to choose to go there over Yale, or any other college. If Yale is the better fit, then it becomes more about the money, and it matters how much money we're talking about, and how it will affect this family.

17.<<<Alexandre>>>
"If the costs were equal, and other things were equal, I'd say go to Yale, because I think it provides a really terrific educational experience."

I would consider the Michigan experience just as terrific Hunt. Personally, I would choose Michigan over Yale because I prefer the culture at the University of Michigan, and I prefer Ann Arbor to New Haven.

That being said, there is no denying the fact that Yale is slightly better academically and reputationally, and if the OP likes Yale as much as Michigan (or better), and if cost of attendance is truly not a concern, Yale would be the way to go.

18.<<<Musicmom2015>>>
The experience at either can be terrific, but it depends what the student is looking for. What is terrific for one is not terrific for all. Alexandre - do you have any experience with Yale? It is reasonable to love one's own school, but I am just curious if you have a real comparison or are just emphasizing the attributes of Michigan. FWIW, I did my grad school at Michigan and I know it's a great school. I just find these two schools quite different in the experience offered to the students. IF the money does not need to be the deciding factor, then student preference and fit should be.

19.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
" IF the money does not need to be the deciding factor, then student preference and fit should be."

I think we all agree on that Musicmom2015.

20.<<<Hunt>>>
If possible, the student should attend accepted student events at both schools to get a better idea of fit--that is, if the financial aid decision from Yale doesn't make Michigan the clearly sensible option.

21.<<<Alexandre>>>
Musicmom, I do not have a great deal of experience with Yale, but I have visited the campus several times between 1991 and 2004. I found the campus pleasing aesthetically, but I did not find the campus environment appealing. It was just a gut feeling based on the people I met and the general feel of the school. I also did not like New Haven at all...I much prefer Ann Arbor.

"FWIW, I did my grad school at Michigan and I know it's a great school. I just find these two schools quite different in the experience offered to the students."

That is my point exactly. Some may prefer Yale to Michigan while others may prefer Michigan to Yale. While Yale is clearly one of the top 5 universities in the US, Michigan is not far behind. For the vast majority of students considering those two universities, assuming money is not a concern, Yale is the way to go. However, some may prefer Michigan significantly to Yale, and choosing Michigan in such a case is not detrimental to the student's academic experience or future.

22.<<<UMDAD>>>
Very interesting thread.

D faced the exact same question 10 years ago. She went to and graduated from Yale. Absolutely loved it!

Biggest deciding factors - (i) smaller school, (ii) residential college system and (iii) less emphasis on NCAA athletics.

Where did she end up? Michigan medical school.

D loved New Haven and now loves Ann Arbor.

"Michigan bought 1,700,000 sq/ft from Pfizer...pretty much state of the art labs and now home to a giant health policy institute...one of the largest in the country."

Yale bought the 1 million + sq./ft from Bayer...pretty much the same thing as M's purchase of the Pfizer property.

23.<<<ClueBus>>>
Thank you everyone for your thoughtful responses. I am so relieved that not one of you said "It's a no-brainer." You would not believe how many times I have heard that--from both sides! (i.e. "It's a no-brainer--Take the money!" or "It's a no-brainer--You DON'T turn down Yale!") The reality is that there is nothing simple about this.

Full disclosure--I am a U of M alum. (I had to laugh at the derisive comments about football--I LOVE Michigan football! :) I had a wonderful experience there. My one beef with the school was the advising (or, total lack thereof.) But, this was 30 years ago (@blue85, it seems we share a graduation year.) My best friend and I laugh about how it's a miracle we ever completed our degrees, with little parent involvement, no advising, and no computers! But, I think D's experience would be much different, being a Shipman Scholar and in LSA Honors. And, the fact that she is extremely focused on what she wants to major in.

Which brings me to another point: Michigan has a true Neuroscience major, where Yale does not. She would major in Psychology/Molecular Bio.

Those of you who asked "Is Yale the dream school?" hit on a very important point. No, it is not. She was rejected REA from her dream school in December (that heartbreaker in California that starts with S. We don't say that name anymore.)

I think the thing that makes this so hard is that the Ivy League is so ingrained in our society to equal excellence. As in "My D had an Ivy-League high school career." Yes, yes she did.

So, still crunching numbers, thinking, and yes, @viphan, if the numbers work, the final decision will be hers.

24.<<<Alexandre>>>
"My one beef with the school was the advising (or, total lack thereof.) But, this was 30 years ago (@blue85, it seems we SHARE a graduation year.) "

Advising is hit or miss. My advisor was excellent, although I did not take full advantage of her experience. All the students I knew were assigned advisors. Some met their advisors frequently, others sporadically (like me) and yet others never. But we all had the option to meet with our advisors as often as we wished. Same with faculty office hours. I never had to wait to met a professor during my four years at Michigan. They all had open door policies and encouraged students to drop in during their office hours.

"I think the thing that makes this so hard is that the Ivy League is so ingrained in our society to equal excellence."

That is definitely true, especially among high school students and concerned parents who wish to maximize their children's chances of beating out the competition in today's competitive world. Thankfully, Michigan is no slouch in the reputation department, particularly in academic circles. In fact, within academe, Michigan's reputation matches that of all the Ivies save HYP and arguably Columbia. But even among the masses, Michigan seems to do well reputationally. According to a Gallup poll conducted in 2003, Michigan was 8th among the masses and 5th among people with advanced degrees. So while Yale may have the edge, Michigan is certainly very well regarded.

Is she going to Bulldog days next week? That may help her decide if she loves Yale enough to be worth the extra costs.

"But, this was 30 years ago (@blue85, it seems we share a graduation year.)"

Well, I admit to the year but I refuse to do the math on it. Good luck to your daughter: any kid who is interested in how the mind works and how people think is likely to find themselves with a great career and with a deep connection to humanity. Congratulations to you for raising such a child.

Yale has a great financial aid program, so it would be odd not to qualify for aid from them. My advice is never to go heavily in debt.

29.<<<Alexandre>>>
Actually excanuck, CC makes much of the vaunted FA programs at private universities, and justifiably so. However, the fact is, for students from upper middle income families and lower upper income families ($200K-$300K/year), attending expensive private universities is usually cost prohibitive. They do not qualify for FA, and yet they do not earn enough to spend $250k on each child's college education, especially if that child has law school or medical school aspirations. Lower-middle income families (under $150k/year) definitely get great deals and high income families ($500k or more per year) can easily afford to cost of attendance. But those stuck in the middle, and they make up a nice chunk of college-bound students, must either sacrifice a great deal or seek alternative options.

30.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
^^^^I am more than certain that Yale does not fill up its halls with a high percentage of students from lower income households.

31.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
One question I'd want to determine is how committed the kid is to the neuroscience/STEM path. And is med school a consideration? Strong commitment and motivation and if she's so good that she'd definitely get in to med school/PhD program and go makes a free ride at UMich more justifiable.

I'm of the opinion that Yale would provide advantages, but I'm of the opinion that Yale would give a bigger boost to a kid who is a marginal med school/PhD candidate (over sink-or-swim UMich) or the smart slacker type or someone undecided (at Yale, she could suddenly change her mind and make the decision to pursue Wall Street junior year; at UMich, if she did so junior year, without being in Ross, that would be a much tougher path). Someone who is smart, driven, and awesome in every way and does not swerve from her goals will do well at either UMich or Yale regardless of what the advising at UMich is like. The greater hand-holding and flexibility at Yale would be of more benefit to someone who isn't so driven or committed or awesome, IMO.

32.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
To expound on this more, if your D got in to Yale and got the full-ride scholarship from UMich, she's probably already pretty awesome. So the key questions are whether she will stay committed to her field and stay motivated. If she will on both counts, it seems very likely that she'll be able to go as far at UMich as at Yale (if she's one of the top students in her field at UMich, I don't think she'd have to worry about advising, and in any case, if you're one of the top students in any STEM field at UMich, advising, hand-holding, and all that won't really matter; you're going to do well) and the big chunk of money spent on Yale likely won't get you/her much tangible benefit. Plus, honors and Shipman should get her a lot of the fuzzy hand-holding stuff that Yale would give.

I do believe that if you're going to drop beaucoup bucks on Yale, you should do so because you're getting something tangible in return (like the ability to more easily switch to Wall Street as the goal or something like that). NOT because other people think HYPSM is the height of excellence or something silly like that. Tell me: would you drop $230K on a Lambo because some chicks and old men dig that car? I don't know about you, but I'm not the type who's swayed in to spending a ton of dough just to pander to other people's opinions and conceits.

33.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
BTW, I think that those folks who understand college admissions would regard winning one of those big scholarships like the Shipman/Stamp at UMich or Jefferson at UVa to be as prestigious as getting in to HYPSM.

The reason for that is simple: about 2K get accepted in to each of HYPS each year (some in to more than 1, but not actually that many) while a little over 1K get in to MIT. However, only a handful (less than 100 at each school) get those big named scholarships at Duke/JHU/Rice/UMich/UVa/ND and 200 get the Regents/Chancellors at Cal.
Far fewer get one of those big named scholarships at an Ivy-equivalent/near-Ivy than in to HYPSM.

For that reason (and because the opportunities at the those schools will be close if not the same as the opportunities at HYPSM), I regard those folks who turn down one of those full-tuition scholarships at Duke to be full-pay at HYPSM (unless they are filthy rich and especially if it's not H or S or maybe M) as batty. I regard those who turn down those big scholarships to JHU/Rice/UMich/UVa/ND to be full-pay somewhere else (again, unless they have a very specific goal, like break in to Silicon Valley VC) as close to batty.

34.<<<Alexandre>>>
But PurpleTrain, isn't someone who is admitted into Michigan and Yale going to be smart and driven? I cannot imagine many slackers getting into to very selective schools.

I definitely agree that a student at Michigan must plan better. For example, if a student really wishes to work on Wall Street (or in any corporate job, including management consulting and leadership development programs at Fortune 500 companies), they will have to make a conscious decision to apply to Ross at the end of Freshman year. Ross students are probably in as good a position (certainly not significantly worse) as Yale students to land a job in such corporate settings, but not LSA students. That is not to say that LSA students do not do well; indeed, I saw a report recently that rated LSA among the top 30 colleges/universities for students seeking work, which is impressive considering that many of the schools ahead of Michigan LSA did not have programs like Ross or a top 10 CoE cannibalizing on job opportunities. However, Yale students will definitely be presented with more ample opportunities than LSA students.

I do not think Yale presents any edge to premed students. The resources and opportunities open to undergraduate students at Michigan for research/publishing papers and medical internships are exceptional. But again, as you point out, the student must actively seek those opportunities out.

35.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@Alexandre, kids may change. I am in no position to judge how likely the D is to slack off or to not be proactive or change focus; I'm just saying that, arguably, Yale provides an advantage to someone who does (but virtually none to someone who's driven, proactive, and focused). And with the Shipman, a lot of that fuzzy stuff will be there at UMich as well. So at this point, paying for Yale is kind of like paying for a Lambo. Other than the pleasure of saying your D goes to Yale (instead of the pleasure of saying your D got the Shipman at UMich; and as I stated before, other people may be different, but I have more respect for someone who has the sense to take a full-ride named scholarship at UMich than someone who turns that down to be full-pay at Yale), I'm not sure what you get from it.

Concerning jobs, getting to the Street would be tougher for someone in LSA but not Ross (or Yale) but I'm frankly not convinced that those F500 rotational programs are harder to get in to from LSA than from Ross or Yale.

As for pre-meds, I'm talking about someone who is a marginal candidate. Someone who is at the top of the heap at UMich will almost certainly do well, but with a ton of pre-meds at UMich, will a marginal candidate get research opportunities or medical internships? Granted, a marginal candidate may not at Yale either (which also has a large percentage of pre-meds).

Hello all! OP here with Decision Day update. Before I get to her decision, responding to some previous posts since my last one. D is 100% committed to Neuroscience. Has been since 8th grade. Wants to do research and make great breakthroughs. No way in halibut would this one ever want to work on Wall Street, lol! I also don't ever see her slacking off; she is way too Type A for that.

Now for the choice: She is taking the Shipman scholarship at Michigan! Among her reasons: 1. Michigan has her major and Yale doesn't. 2. She loves the people she met at Shipman Weekend; already has a roommate. 3.She met a professor at Shipman Weekend that she wants to do research with. 4. She wants to be in the Michigan Marching Band! She comes from a high school with a top marching band, and it has been a huge part of her life. She wants to continue the tradition of training and excellence. And, last but not least, 5. She loves the modern decor and furniture at Alice Lloyd (where the Shipman Scholars live.) As opposed to those "Old" dorms at Yale. LOLOLOL! There's no accounting for taste!

Thank you to all of you for your input on this thread. Some of our friends IRL have been very harsh in their opinions on this decision. It hurts. But we trust our D enough to know what is best for her.

We're all human, but ask your friends if they'd go gaga over someone getting a Lamo/Bentley or buying a mansion. If they would, then you can just say that you have different values. If they truly believe that Yale would provide some advantage that UMich would not, you can lay out the cases that I and you have made and ask them where we are wrong. Likely, they would not be able to come up with anything, show their ignorance, and would be educated.
Selfishly, I'm really curious as to what they would say.

In any case, it's your family, not their's. I find it strange why anyone would care where other people's children go to school.

She has more than enough reason to choose UMich. My D loves Alice Loyd although she lives in MoJo which is right next to it. Can you pm me which professor she wants to do research with? Perhaps I can give some comments about that faculty.

@PurpleTitan , D has been a top student all through her years in our school system. I think it's been somewhat of a sport in our neighborhood wondering where she would end up. Because lots of kids from her school go to Michigan, I think they see it as something of a letdown. But no one else from her school got the Shipman! :) D does not like to be stressed about money, and she doesn't want us to be either.

Best wishes to your daughter...with a strong gpa she will be on a track to elite credentials.

That's cool and all, but I'm still mystified by why anyone not related to her would care. Do they get a boost in self-esteem if they know a Yalie? Do they have money on a bet riding on the outcome? I don't get it.

Can they provide any reasonable arguments in support of their position?

46.<<<ClueBus>>>
@PurpleTitan , I would guess "Prestige." Regarding money, a couple of posters earlier in the thread mentioned Yale's much-lauded Financial Aid. In the end, their package was decent. Decent, but not great. Somehow, my H and I picked up on a phrase tossed around at the Information Sessions last year about "10% of income." But it came out to be much more than that. And yes, we did run the NPC, but again you hear that the top schools' offers are often more generous. Our fatal mistake was not realizing how much home equity would affect the offers. We have lived in our house for 20 years, and our neighborhood has bounced back nicely from the downturn, so of course we have equity. But absolutely no desire to take out loans.

Also, dealing with Yale's Financial Aid office was horrible. Very understaffed. Quite surprising. But in spite of all this, if D had REEEAAAALLY wanted to go there, we would have made it happen. But she chose Michigan. GO BLUE!

"Can they provide any reasonable arguments in support of their position?"

The grass is greener elsewhere mentality I would think PurpleTitan. Many people from instate have no idea how truly great the University of Michigan is and are still stuck in the past thinking that all strong students automatically get accepted into the flagship.

48.<<<ClueBus>>>
Regarding Lloyd/Mojo dorms, I have to wonder if the Psychology department did a study that showed that smart/artsy kids prefer modern design to traditional! :)

49.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@rjkofnovi, OK, I can understand why some people have the "grass is greener" mentality, even if I think it's silly. But neither grass is theirs. Do they think that the prestige of her school would rub off on them or something?

50.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
It might be some kind of midwestern ethos. Who knows?

51.<<<blue85>>>
Many people think they inherit prestige by transitivity...my brother's gardner's sister's cousin goes to....

52.<<<Alexandre>>>
I am not surprised that a lot of the people who know her felt she should have gone to Yale. Ironically, state flagships, even those of Michigan's caliber, are very undervalued by their local populations, and unsurprisingly so; it is natural to take what you have for granted. If it is affordable and accessible, how can it be good, right?

53.<<<anhydrite>>>
Yes, I have echoed that same sentiment re: Alexandre and rjk. If the money favors the in-state, outstanding flagship, many in-staters will still feel it is the default choice; due to the proximity and popularity, they'll feel their flagship is somehow deficient. In-state students have trouble sometimes objectively assessing the qualities of their own flagships vs. the allure of elite schools further away. I think forums like this can help balance that assessment to a degree, but the stigma will always hang around some high school students. Ultimately, some will be able to pierce that veil. Others won't.

54.<<<conpar39>>>
we had the same issue with our daughter who was choosing between u of m, our instate school and washington university in st louis. because many kids in her class got into u of m and it is just 30 minutes from our home, she felt that it was not all that special. However, the 50,000/year difference in tuition to us ( we have an MET plan so we would now only have to pay room and board) was too much of a difference for us for her to go to wash u. it just did not make sense. so she is going to u of m. We are hoping that once she is there, she will realize how great a school it really is.

55.<<<billcsho>>>
It is hard to compare just the 2 schools. You need to look into specific programs even just for the fame. For instance, students want to study engineering, there is really not a second thought to choose UMich over Yale.
My D choose UMich over Northwestern for engineering with no regret even both are great school for that and the latter is more prestigious. When both schools are affordable and have good programs, the school that fits the student most would be the main consideration.

56.<<<viphan>>>
A little late, but awesome choice!

I went to Yale for a week for a summer program. The dorms, while aesthetically pleasing, did NOT have an AC so I suffered throughout the night fighting with the mosquitoes' offensive.

57.<<<Hunt>>>
I think this was a very reasonable decision, but I do take umbrage at the implied slight of the Yale Precision Marching Band. (I'm kidding.)

58.<<<Alexandre>>>
"I think forums like this can help balance that assessment to a degree, but the stigma will always hang around some high school students."

anhydrite, if by "forum like this" you mean the Michigan page, I agree. We demystify many misconceptions here. But if you mean CC, then I disagree. The CC community by and large is extremely prejudiced against public universities.

59.<<<Alexandre>>>
billcsho, Northwestern is more prestigious than Michigan among high school kids, but not among college-educated people, and certainly not in academic or corporate circles.

60.<<<billcsho>>>
^ It is considered slightly more prestigious as reflected by the significantly lower admission rate.

61.<<<Alexandre>>>
billcsho, that was my point; admit rates generally impress high school students and parents seeking bragging rights. To high school students, NU is more prestigious than Michigan. I would never question that. Of course, as Michigan's admit rate continues to plummet, that could change in the coming 5-10 years. I estimate that Michigan's admit rate could drop to as low as 15% by 2020.

However, college professors/presidents, graduate school admissions committees, corporate recruiters etc...do not reference admit rates to determine prestige. They rely more on the quality of the institution (research, faculty, programs, facilities, resources, alumni accomplishments etc...) to establish a university's prestige. That is why most reputational ratings conducted by academe rate Michigan and NU roughly the same.

So, among high school kids and boastful parents, NU is more prestigious than Michigan. But among highly educated people (particularly people with advanced degrees, members of academe ec...), and among corporate recruiters, Michigan and NU are equally prestigious.

62.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@Alexandre, NU is considered more prestigious by many adults (most of whom aren't in academia). You also have to differentiate between undergrad and grad. What I said holds even more true when you consider only the undergraduates (even among academia). Look, UMich offers terrific opportunities and the cream of the crop there are as good as anywhere, but its also a giant school with more variation in the student body than most elite privates. People understand that.

63.<<<Alexandre>>>
"NU is considered more prestigious by many adults (most of whom aren't in academia). "

Sure PurpleTitan...and there are many adults who consider Michigan more prestigious than NU. By and large, the two are equally prestigious. But the opinion of those adults hardly matters. Most adults who are ignorant enough to differentiate between those two amazing universities are not really in a position to admit students into graduate programs or to hire candidates into major companies.

"Look, UMich offers terrific opportunities and the cream of the crop there are as good as anywhere, but its also a giant school with more variation in the student body than most elite privates. People understand that."

I don't. Perhaps you can explain how the "variations" in the student body at Michigan influences the prestige of the school. Most universities earn their reputation through the strength of their faculties, quality of their facilities, accomplishments of their alumni etc... In this regard, Michigan is clearly among the top universities in the nation. And how large a variation are we talking about? Last year's Freshman class at Michigan had mid 50% ACT/SAT ranges not unlike those at Brown, Cornell, Northwestern and Penn.

Mid 50% ACT:
Brown 30-34
Cornell 29-33
Michigan 30-34
Northwestern 31-34
Penn 31-34

Mid 50% SAT:
Brown 1330-1550
Cornell 1330-1510
Michigan 1280-1480
Northwestern 1390-1560
Penn 1360-1550

So, is the variation significant enough to make Michigan's student body inferior? And if so, does it impact prestige sufficiently to make Michigan significantly less prestigious?

@Alexandre, the quality of the student body also matters when it comes to university reputation (and affects the quality of the alumni).

There not a big difference these days, but there is a difference, and that shows up in alumni achievements:
<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/1682986-ivy-equivalents.html</url>

UMichs alums do well, but on a per capita basis, they're just below the Ivies (while NU is within the range of the Ivies; granted, on the lower end with the "lesser" Ivies; interesting aside: in terms of alumni achievement, the low end of the Ivies is set not only by Cornell but also UPenn and Columbia, even though these days, kids seem to think that those 2 are almost HYPSM-status).

Not a big difference, but not exactly the same either.

65.<<<Alexandre>>>
PurpleTitan, 1. I am not sure I agree that alumni accomplishment have such a tangible impact on a university's prestige or reputation, and if it does, it should be the collective accomplishments of the alumni body that impact a university's reputation on an absolute scale, not on a relative scale. In other words, the greater the number of alumni accomplishing great deeds, the greater the reputation of the school among the masses. On an absolute scale, Michigan beats virtually all universities save a handful. On a relative scale, Michigan will match Northwestern and several other private elites. You are completely incorrect in your assertion that NU alumni, on average, accomplish more than Michigan alumni.

Using your four criteria for alumni accomplishments, Michigan matches NU PurpleTitan. If you think that NU produces a higher rate of exceptional alumni, you are sadly mistaken:

PERCENTAGE ENTERING ELITE GRADUATE SCHOOLS:
Not many elite schools publish such figures, but with the exception of NU and Chicago graduate schools (Michigan makes up much of the ground lost with its own elite graduate schools, which enroll an unusually high number of Michigan alums), Michigan holds its own nicely against NU.

For example, Michigan currently has 11 alumni enrolled at Yale Law school, compared to 10 NU alumni. I realize Michigan has 3 times as many undergraduate students, but only about twice as many prelaw students. There are roughly 60 NU alumni enrolled at Chicago and NU law schools combined (compared to 40 Michigan alums), but then you have roughly 150 Michigan alums enrolled at Michigan law school (compared to 20-30 from NU and Chicago). Michigan has enrolled roughly twice as many undergraduate alums into UVa Law school as NU undergraduate alumni.

Not many medical schools publish the undergraduate origins of their students, but the two that do give Michigan a slight edge; Johns Hopkins Medical School currently has 11 Michigan alums compared to NU's 5. Michigan Medical School, admittedly favors its own, currently has over 200 Michigan alums compared to fewer than 20 NU alums. Again, while Michigan has three times as many undergraduate students as NU, Michigan typically has twice as many premeds as NU.

Also, since 2000, 8 Michigan alumni have gone on to earn PhDs in Physics from Harvard. That's as many as Chicago alumni, and more than Cornell alumni. Northwestern has produced none (zero). Do not let Michigan's overall size advantage fool you. Chicago and Cornell have as many undergraduate Physics majors as Michigan.

<url>https://www.physics.harvard.edu/academics/phds</url>

Like I said, there aren't many programs that actually list the undergraduate origins of their graduate students, but those that do seem to indicate that Michigan holds its own sufficiently for it not to be considered inferior to Northwestern.

ACADEMIC AWARDS:
Michigan has produced 410 Fulbright Scholars since 1990. NU has produced an impressive 270 in that same period. Overall, Michigan has produced 75 Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater and Churchill scholars, compared to NU's 55. While in both cases, NU produced a higher rate, it is not significant.

PERCENTAGE GETTING PHD:
Again, I fail to see the relevance. But in the case of Michigan vs Northwestern, there is no advantage one way or the other. According to the National Science Foundation, in the 10 year period from 2002-2011, Michigan produced 2,200 PhDs in the Sciences and Engineering, compared to Northwestern's 950 (roughly 5% for both schools). That is not bad mind you. Even schools like Brown, CMU, Cornell, Dartmouth, JHU and even Stanford have 6%-8% PhD production rates.

In addition to the metrics mentioned by Alexandre, Michigan also has a large number of graduates who have won: the MacArthur, the Guggenheim, and the Sloan fellowship. The Sloan fellowship is notable in that a comparatively high percentage of Nobel prizes are won by folks who have first won the Sloan, so Michigan may have a few future Nobelists out there...

67.<<<Alexandre>>>
Anyway, we have skewed long enough. The OP's daughter chose Michigan over Yale for the right reasons and I am sure she will spend four amazing years in Ann Arbor. I am closing this thread as it is no longer necessary to keep it active.
