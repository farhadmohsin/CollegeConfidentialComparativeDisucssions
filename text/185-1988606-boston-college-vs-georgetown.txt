I was lucky enough to be accepted by both of these schools. They’re both among my top choices. I was just wondering what people’s thoughts are when comparing the two. I’m currently undecided and not leaning towards any specific field or major (unhelpful, I know). I like that they both offer a strong liberal arts education, and I could see myself attending either of them

2.<<<moooop>>>
Boston & DC are both fascinating cities, but they have little in common. Have you visited both?

3.<<<lrose00>>>
@moooop Yeah and I really liked both of them in terms of campus and location

4.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Georgetown will be stronger academically and more recognized internationally.
However, are they both the same cost for you?
To know your net cost at each, do (tuition, fees, room, board) -(grants, scholarships) =
Do not deduct any loan or work study.

5.<<<hzhao2004>>>
Georgetown is superior in virtually all aspects.  Unless BC is significantly cheaper, it should be a very easy decision.

6.<<<ab2002>>>
@hzhao2004 I completely agree. Georgetown is absolutely amazing.

7.<<<ccfk1221>>>
gtown!

8.<<<3sonsmom>>>
I’ll send some love for BC!    We went to Accepted Student Day yesterday, twins have it in their top two.   We’ve never been to Georgetown honestly.    Both in top three Catholic colleges.

9.<<<lrose00>>>
@MYOS1634 currently waiting on my aid to be processed by gtown, hopefully they do it soon! Also waiting on an appeal from BC because their aid was not great. Right now I wanted peoples opinions regardless of COA.
@hzhao2004 @ab2002 @ccfk1221 thanks for the feedback! Can you give any specific reasons why you would pick Georgetown over BC? BC has been my first choice for over a year probably. I wasn’t expecting to be accepted by Georgetown so I haven’t really considered it.

10.<<<MYOS1634>>>
BC factors real estate assets very heavily - basically they expect you use HELOC for your college costs.
Georgetown is generally considered the most prestigious among both and among the “Ivy+” colleges (similar to Ivies although not in the athletic league, like Northwestern, UChicago…)

11.<<<ab2002>>>
@lrose00 Well, it’s in Washington D.C. for one. Washington is pretty hard to beat. There’s so much history, and there is tons of stuff to do. At BC, you’re pretty far away from downtown, so you won’t have a ton of opportunities to go downtown. It’s about two hours from Boston. Georgetown is literally eight minutes from the White House. Personally, I believe that the education at Georgetown will exceed BC. This may be biased, because I absolutely LOVE Georgetown and its vibe.

@ab2002 Please keep it factual.  Lower campus is inside the Boston city limits. Plenty of opportunities to go downtown, even work part-time downtown (as I did).

13.<<<wisteria100>>>
Since when is BC 2 hours from Boston??

14.<<<happy1>>>
I’d suggest:

If one of the schools turns out to be materially more affordable, go there.
If finances are equal visit both during accepted students day and decide.


15.<<<ab2002>>>
@evergreen5 Sorry, I plugged it into the GPS and it came up as 2 hours and 5 mins. It’s about 30 minutes from downtown.

Georgetown has some very fine professional schools, but in the liberal arts there is little (if any) difference between Georgetown and BC. I’d select based on fit.

17.<<<ccfk1221>>>
better school overall, better career center, DC has more opportunities than boston  - a lot of people in your position who are undecided end up in finance/consulting and georgetown has good relationships with top banks, consulting firms etc

18.<<<Nocreativity1>>>
Considered the most “most prestigious among the ivy plus”.  Great school but Ivy plus is Stamford, U Chicago, MIT, and Duke.  All 8% acceptance rates or lower.
Please stay factual.

19.<<<lrose00>>>
@ab2002 BC isn’t that far from Boston, but it’s true that Georgetown is closer to Washington. I love Washington and Boston, so that isn’t really helpful either lol. I do love the historic aspect of both cities.

20.<<<lrose00>>>
@MYOS1634 would you say that Georgetown also heavily factors in real estate? I’m praying for a good aid package

21.<<<MYOS1634>>>
what do you mean “heavily factor in real estate”?

22.<<<a20171>>>
– BC has a stronger conservative/catholic tradition than Georgetown, which is pretty liberal despite being Jesuit
– Georgetown is known for having a wealthier student body than BC
– BC Hockey, Georgetown basketball (not the greatest but there’s a lot of history and tradition in their program)
– Suburban vibe at BC vs more of an urban vibe at Georgetown
– Georgetown has a competitive nature (getting into clubs etc.) BC not so much (but this can be a pro or a con because some people thrive in a competitive environment.
– OF COURSE, it doesn’t really need to be said that Georgetown is more highly ranked and prestigious than BC.

23.<<<am9799>>>
@MYOS1634  He is asking if Georgetown counts  home equity as aggressively as BC does in financial aid calculations.

24.<<<lrose00>>>
@MYOS1634 @am9799 She*, but yes that’s exactly what im asking

25.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Oh, ok. No, they don’t.

26.<<<prezbucky>>>
Georgetown is a little better overall, in my opinion. If they are even for fit and cost, or if you aren’t sure, I would choose Georgetown.
However, BC is a good school, and if you strongly prefer Boston and/or the (full) D1 sports scene… or if there is a sizable difference in cost… then BC would make sense.
For some context: Georgetown’s undergraduate peers include (IMO) Notre Dame, Washington U, Rice, Emory, Vanderbilt, and maybe CMU.
I have BC’s peers as Wake Forest, Lehigh, Tulane, U of Rochester, NYU, BU, Case, Brandeis… maybe Tufts and USC. Some have those last two in a different group.

27.<<<International_Dad>>>
BC is a 20 minutes by car to downtown, less than 40 minutos in metro (trolley, very slowly} B green line, but normally people from BC don’t go to downtown, not need to do it, you can find every things to do near campus, at 20 minutes by metro or less than 10 minutes by car o BC bus.
I think Georgetown have more international prestigious,  But Boston is a great city for youngers, students everywhere.
Both are amazing options, congrats.

28.<<<momcinco>>>
Have you run net price calcs for both?  I did once and for us BC was unaffordable whereas Georgetown was almost as generous as an Ivy.

29.<<<lrose00>>>
@momcinco I ran the NPC for BC and it was nowhere near the actual aid they offered for me so I’m a little bit cautious

30.<<<momcinco>>>
Oh ok but do you mean more or less generous?
Also - if your family owns a business or farm, or your parents are divorced, or there are large expenses - those factors might have an effect.

31.<<<moooop>>>
@wisteria 100, BC being located  somewhere near Springfield  is no less amazing than the top American colleges suddenly being HYPSG, and BC apparently fighting it out with Bunker Hill Community College to be the 50th best college in Beantown. Most of this thread is fake news except for warblersrule’s post #15.

32.<<<privatebanker>>>
@wisteria100
Great choices. Congratulations. We have the same choices but admitted students day(s) pushed it clearly to Boston College. Facilities. The vibe of the kids and smiles. Commitment to core and core renewal was excellent. My D is a premed and total STEM focus. Having a commitment to liberal arts for all as part of the educational process is important to her.  No wrong choices here for you.  USNWR has Gtown at 20 and BC 30.  Forbes and elsewhere are similar. BCs business school is even better. PreMed counseling center is better at BC in our opinion as well. Know folks who went through both. Follow your heart and your head will be fine

During the snowstorm last month- it was pretty crazy  

34.<<<3sonsmom>>>
@privatebanker   Were you in the standing room only Core Renewal presentation this past Sunday?    We split with one son each and also attended freshman experience, psychology, residential life and I went with science son to the chemistry section,   Entertaining, knowledgeable professor and a current senior highlighted the support for medical school application process.   The hike to the dorm tour was a challenge but the students handled it.

35.<<<tR5674>>>
Half of BC’s campus is within city limits.  Half hour to downtown on trolley.  15 minute walk to Cleveland Circle.
Georgetown is a 5 minute walk to great stuff but a half hour subway to the mall.   Anyone saying that DC has more opportunities than Boston is confused.
No bad choice here.

36.<<<wisteria100>>>
I asked my D this question as we visited both recently and she likes both. She picked G’town, but said BC felt like it had stronger community aspects. Since BC is getting not a lot of love on this thread, I’ll agree with @privatebanker that faculties and campus at BC is better and it seems friendlier and less stressful.

37.<<<Mastadon>>>
In terms of financial opportunities.
Boston is a top ten global financial center, DC is top 50.
Both have access to NYC.

38.<<<privatebanker>>>
The dorm was a hike. But probably good to help stay in shape!   Biology professor from MIT was excellent. They just bought her a 300k microscope for research. Liked that they really encourage undergrad research. Good luck at Georgetown @wisteria100. She’ll love it!

39.<<<privatebanker>>>
@3sonsmom   Yes we were in the SRO core lecture. Thought the two profs from different disciplines co-teaching the class was very novel.  Also the small class staying together for two semesters with reflections discussion at night over dinner was interesting too. What did you think?

40.<<<par72>>>
Agree with other posters that Georgetown has the stronger academic reputation and better alumni network.

41.<<<3sonsmom>>>
@privatebanker  We were impressed with so many choices in the core classes.   I want one of them to take “your brain on theatre”  (I believe that was it).   Two unrelated courses with the professors and the discussions, team building, our group liked the idea.  I told my sons I want to take these classes.    Rutgers this Sat. and decisions are next!

42.<<<privatebanker>>>
I want to go back!

43.<<<lrose00>>>
Thanks everyone for the insight, I’ll have to make my decision when financial aid is finalized. Hopefully they are both affordable.
Would I be notified if I was awarded any of these scholarships (https://finaid.georgetown.edu/financial-resources/undergrad-scholarships) with my financial aid award?

44.<<<VAMom23>>>
@lrose00 We received the Georgetown financial aid package on Saturday. It just said “Georgetown Scholarship” for part of the award. If you have not already contacted your individual financial aid POC, I would do so now to make sure that your package is in process. The financial aid POC was great, and told us when a decision has been made and when to expect it.  There are listings by last name on the web site. My son is currently weighing Georgetown SFS and UVA.  Will be headed to GAAP on 4/20.  Decisions, decisions. Good luck.

45.<<<irishfan21>>>
Boston College… I visited both but ended up only applying to BC out of those too, I loved the vibe there and didn’t; quite feel it at Georgetown. Unfortunately, I will be going elsewhere do to cost lol but I wish you the best of luck and remember to use your brain, listen to your heart, and follow your gut. You will know which is the best one.

46.<<<lrose00>>>
@VAMom23 They requested that I send some additional documents, but I was only able to do that a few days because I was away for Easter. Hopefully they’ve received them - I’ll contact my POC tomorrow to make sure.
if you used the NPC, did you find that the actual aid Gtown offered you was close to what the NPC said? Good luck to your son!

47.<<<VAMom23>>>
@lrose00 I’ll send you a PM.

48.<<<privatebanker>>>
Also. Check out two great videos on YouTube or if you google it.  BC “Happy” and Shake it off. BC.  The later Taylor Swift tweeted out to her 45 million followers.  They are great and give a good look at some facilities the kids and some fun

49.<<<am9799>>>
@lrose00
Did financial aid work and did you make your decision?

50.<<<lrose00>>>
@am9799 haven’t received my package yet. uploading documents through college board’s iDoc took about ten years to get to georgetown. I gave up on it and I’ve been emailing the office and they finally said yesterday that they received everything and will update my portal soon. my fingers are crossed lol.
I wasn’t able to make it to accepted students day, but if the package isn’t that great we’re going to go down next week and talk to the financial aid office in person. the net price calculator gave a really good number but I don’t know if it’ll be accurate or not

51.<<<lrose00>>>
just received an update to my portal. They gave me 21k. It would be possible for me to go there if they gave me 10 or 15k more, if I took out a little bit in loans. Does anyone think going to the financial aid office in person and asking for more money would be successful?
My family has a unique financial situation and I explained that to my advisor in our emails but she didn’t seem sympathetic. With 3 kids in college next year my family needs a little bit more help from gtown than 21k …

52.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Was the “3 kids in college” situation clear in the financial aid application?

53.<<<lrose00>>>
@MYOS1634 pretty sure it was but even so I think it’s worth mentioning again, along with the costs of their colleges.
I think things were complicated by the fact that my dads construction work is considered a business even though he hasn’t been successful in the past two years and he’s been losing money. Also worth mentioning …
Is going in person more successful when asking for more money?

54.<<<MYOS1634>>>
No, but you can go if you wish - you need to highlight information that wasn’t provided or that wasn’t clear. In particular, provide detailed information about your father’s business and it’s financial losses.

55.<<<moooop>>>
During how many of your 4 years of college will there be “3 kids in college”?

56.<<<lrose00>>>
@moooop I have a twin so it will be at least two kids for all four years. My older sibling will be a senior in the fall, but is pursuing a nursing degree in a two year accelerated program after graduation that my parents will help with. I’m not sure if that counts

57.<<<VAMom23>>>
I have been discussing FA with Georgetown over the last few weeks. Siblings only count to reduce the EFC at Georgetown if they are enrolled in an undergrad program. Feel free to go in person, but I don’t get the idea that there is a lot of flexibility from the FA office. They have been responsive, but not budging. They advised us that they do not consider scholarships awarded from other universities. We received a good package, but year 4 is making it look  impossible because my EFC will go up 40% (GU explained that they split the EFC between two kids as 60/40)
