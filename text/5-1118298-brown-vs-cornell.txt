Hi, everyone. I got accepted to both Brown and Cornell and am having a hard time deciding between the two. They both gave me about the same financial aid offer, although at Cornell I was accepted for the Hunter R. Rawling III research program and rejected at Brown for PLME, which I wanted to be apart of. Right now I am sort of leaning towards Cornell, but still haven't visited either. I will be visiting within the next few weeks. If you could give me your thoughts on the two in comparison academic/social wise, or anything else it will be much appreciated. Thanks!

2.<<<Dad2>>>
Cornell is academically stronger than Brown (and more rigorous). Cornell is certainly tops in the sciences (great undergraduate and graduate programs, top faculty).

3.<<<fireandrain>>>
[quote]Cornell is academically stronger than Brown (and more rigorous).[/quote]

That is his opinion. Others will disagree strongly. Academically, both schools are excellent.

4.<<<swim2daend>>>
Ya, I would definitely disagree very strongly to Dad2's statement. Without any real sources to back that statement, I would disregard that post as it's not true. We have fa nominal science/math programs here. Though the ENGINEERING school I will say is better at Cornell (as it is very hard to rival their program and I think many would agree that Cornell Engineering is very impressive), to say that Cornell is better than Brown AS A WHOLE is so shockingly wrong in the most blunt way possible. To a point where some people (including myself) are somewhat offended.

Both are great schools and Congrats nas2011 for getting into both (especially this year)!! You really will be happy at either school. I would say the visit will be the more important part of your decision, so just keep an open mind and there will be a LOT of info sessions where your questions will be answered by Brown.

I would be able to give you better feedback if I knew enough about Cornell's research program, but I've actually never heard of it before haha. Don't think this place is just for the humanities though. It's a very false stereotype that befalls on Brown.

5.<<<monydad>>>
There are differences, particularly in setting and scope. Brown's entire program encompasses only two of Cornell's seven undergraduate colleges, consequently Cornell's student body obviously has a much more diverse range of academic interests and characteristics. Many ultimately find the existence of the varied colleges to be a benefit. For example my daughter has taken courses in three of the colleges, some of which she would not have imagined taking before she got there. But others may alternatively prefer more homogeneity.

Being part of a large community of students in a college town that is of and for students has its advantages, for life as a college student. Providence, as a much larger city, offers different advantages. The winter weather in Providence is a little better, usually. And it is closer to get to major cities and desirable destinations from there.

I think your visits will help you decide where you feel you belong.

6.<<<mgcsinc>>>
"Brown's entire program encompasses only two of Cornell's seven undergraduate colleges, consequently Cornell's student body obviously has a much more diverse range of academic interests and characteristics."

Lol, cute shilling, monydad.

Brown is not divided into distinct schools with distinct academic programs. This is a <i>good</i> thing, because it means that people with diverse academic interests are all under one umbrella. To claim that Brown is a land of homogeneity just because it isn't carved up into separate pieces is ridiculous.

7.<<<nas2011>>>
Thanks for all the feedback. I think the visit will be my most important decision factor as well swim2daend and monydad. I am staying overnight at both campuses, so hopefully that will help. The bad thing would be if I find if I like both equally despite there differences! haha. Then my decision will be even harder. Does anyone else have any input?

8.<<<monydad>>>
"Lol, cute shilling, monydad"

I am not shilling at all. The various specialty colleges at Cornell are not merely additional arts &amp; sciences colleges, they offer curricula, majors and courses that are not commonly found at Arts &amp; sciences colleges, for the most part. There is some overlap and duplication with CAS and with others of the colleges there, but to a significant extent the specialty colleges are truly different. Perhaps one needs to attend there to fully understand the extent of the differences, but it is a fact.

Perhaps Brown actually offers courses and majors such as: agronomy and other areas of agriculture, hotel administration, industrial and labor relations, architecture, fiber science, nutrition, business administration, communications, I can go on and on. OP can go ahead and compare himself, I''ve no reason to care much.

Upon quick check, one source says
"Brown University offers 95 majors in 20 areas of study."
"Cornell University offers 139 majors in 26 areas of study."

So this is not shilling, this is fact, it is an aspect of Cornell that actually distinguishes it from many other schools it is often compared to. The Cornell course catalog is over 700 pages long. It has nothing to do with the organization into different colleges per se, it has everything to do with the fact that these different specialty colleges are truly different, and teach subjects that are outside the realm of what is generally offered at arts &amp; sciences colleges. That's why they came into existence in the first place.

Now one can ask, why do I as an Arts &amp; sciences student care? And this is a reasonable question. Before one comes there, it is not obvious that the odd programs in these disparate colleges can add value to you as a student in the Arts &amp; sciences college. But in practice, they often can.

The types of things a CAS student might do before they graduate include: Seeing if you like marketing by taking a course at the Dyson school; doing an independent study with a communications prof in the ag school, that may well have informed a future career path; taking the wines class for fun, either through the Hotel school or more intensively in the ag school, taking a popular nutrition course in Hum Ec, Doing an extracurricular TA'ing a law course for prisoners, run by a prof at the law school. Or doing an independent study course in solar energy with an ag school prof,and courses in natural resources at the ag school, as I did years ago.

This is not an encyclopedic list obviously, it is merely illustrative. The point is, many people wind up finding value in these "different " colleges, once they are there, though they never expected to previously.

Even the areas of overlap represent additional opportunities that many students find value in. For example, D2 wanted to take an intro statistics class, there were five different classes to choose from in 4 different colleges, IIRC. Each with different levels and slants, and offered at different times and places. She took the one that most matched her preferences. I believe accounting is another area of duplication, assuming one wants to take it they can do so at dyson, or the hotel school, I believe. There are a number of other cases like this. All serving to maximize student choice.

As long as you get As and do one thing you get into Cornell (usually), while still an accomplishment, Cornell is known as the safety to the real ivies. Academics aside it is garunteed that brown with an admission rate of just 8.7 % this year will hve a more selective and therefore more impressive student body than Cornell with a huge class of 18% (only including arts and sciences) then account for the state school part and roughly 30% of students get into Cornell. Woul you rather be a peer to Several thousand kids who got all As and did one or two minor things or would you like to meet Emma Watson, one of the many amazing students that made it through brown's extremely selective admissions process.

11.<<<monydad>>>
??? In Fall 2010 Cornell CAS accepted 15.7% of applicants, the aggregate university accepted 18.4% overall. For Fall 2011 the aggregate university accepted just under 18% of applicants. 2011 CAS stats are not yet available.

Emma Watson is no longer at Brown.

12.<<<swim2daend>>>
^ Yes she is... She's promoting Deathly Hallows Part 2. Could you imagine the amount of time she needs to conclude the final installment of any kind to one of the most revolutionary modern series in the world?? You're so adamant that Cornell is better. The admissions rates above are true, but I don't see the purpose since the acceptance rate as a whole is still more than double of Brown's, but admission rates still don't say which school is better (hence why I think the topic of admission is kind of superfluous).

The idea of Brown having a better and more cohesive student body CANNOT be proven; however, I truly believe it is and I feel the education I'm receiving here is much better than anything Cornell could offer me (and this is an entire personal reaction to Brown's education. Some people could EASILY disagree and say they couldn't prosper the same way at Brown as they could at Cornell). The differences are astronomical, so AGAIN the visit should answer your questions about which you should choose.

About the majors, we have an independent concentration.... meaning you can major in anything you like as long as you have a good reason to do so and you've set up your own requirements...

Can we stop this Cornell-Brown feud now please, monydad? It's really not helping the OP and even though you have your opinions, be respectful to the fact that the OP really does have a hard decision to make (life changing). Just be objective and not just keep posting trying to show how Cornell is better. There will always be a counterargument to what you say Cornell is better because Brown is just different than Cornell.

14.<<<Iheartschool12>>>
@kylerblood You have the worst argument.

And for the record, both are phenomenal institutions that are deeply respected throughout the world. Visit both, then decide.

15.<<<Napster>>>
USNews is the absolute last source you should use in choosing between Brown and Cornell...

My opinion: Come to Brown and you won't regret it. I personally feel that the academic environment is stronger at Brown than at Cornell, and it's undeniable that the weather is more reasonable. Plus, visiting Boston and NYC is actually possible, whereas Cornell is pretty much really far away.

You may not agree, and that might be a good thing. Visit both and choose which feels right :) Good luck.

16.<<<Aj1410>>>
@ monydad ...... She will be back to complete her degree !!

17.<<<monydad>>>
"You're so adamant that Cornell is better."

That's completely untrue. In my first post I merely articulated some of the differences I perceived betweeen the two universities. Which do not all necessarily point in one direction. Read it.

That feature that I was forced to elaborate upon happens to be an actual feature of Cornelll that is in fact different. I think that particular aspect is in fact "better".

But that's hardly the only factor that would weigh in such a decision of what is "better", that entirely depends on the weights and criteria of the individual. Nor is it the only factor I myself raised in the first place.

" She will be back to complete her degree !! "
We'll see...

"About the majors, we have an independent concentration"
Cornell CAS at least used to have a "College Scholar" program that is essentially the same thing, interested parties should check.

But that reminds me of some other differences, I believe Brown is incredibly liberal about distribution requirements, or maybe they don't even exist, and IIRC they can drop courses essentially any time. Someone correct me if this is mistaken. Cornell is more traditional/ typical in these two respects.

"Can we stop this Cornell-Brown feud now please, monydad? "
Please do, stop challenging my completely accurate posts and posting wrong numbers.

18.<<<fireandrain>>>
Both are excellent schools,where you can get a phenomenal education. You will be challenged academically and you will be interacting with brilliant students and professors at both places. It is absurd to argue that one school is academically better than the other -- you are splitting hairs with that argument.

Because Cornell is larger, and has more academic departments, there will be some more options than at Brown. But Brown still offers plenty of classes, and students can do independent study. Frankly, sometimes too much choice is overwhelming and counterproductive. (If that interests you, take the class Decision making give in the cognitive science department.)

I think the differences between the two are mainly in location. Cornell is near a small town, but has a rural feel. It has a HUGE campus that goes on forever. You are in a remote location. Once you include all the grad schools and separate colleges, there are a lot of students, and you could probably walk around and not recognize anyone.

Brown is in a small city on the East Coast with easy access and numerous transportation options to Boston and NYC. It is a smaller place, with a more intimate feel than Cornell, and there are few grad schools and different colleges. Walk on the Green, and you will bump into people you know all the time.

Both are beautiful campuses -- I was at Cornell this summer, and have to say one of its libraries looks almost identical to one of Brown's. It was eerie!

19.<<<mgcsinc>>>
Like I said before, monydad, your Cornell-shilling window-dressed as balanced advice is adorable. If you'll allow me the luxury of borrowing a test from the law, no reasonable person could understand your faint praise (<i>see</i> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damn_with_faint_praise" rel="nofollow">Damn with faint praise - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>) of Brown as a legitimate. If you want to come here and rep Cornell, that's fine -- that's a good thing -- but be honest about what you're doing.

A more analytical deconstruction of your silliness to follow, when I have time.

20.<<<swim2daend>>>
...and I never posted any numbers... I just know that 8.7 x 2 = 17.4 &lt; 18... This is using your Cornell acceptance rate numbers. I don't care enough about Cornell to actually look up their stuff (since I do go there and never will...).

The reason why you're getting this reaction, monydad, is because it looks like you're attacking Brown and cutting down everything about it. We've worked HARD to come to this school and it is insulting to say that a school many turn down for this school is infinitely times better. We just came back from Spring break and another round of midterms starts today. If you're looking for well-researched arguments from students, I doubt many of us have the time (for you've brought up many points that would require much time to look up).

Regardless, (s)he's visiting both schools where she'll find out these statistics and will be able to compare them much clearly than what's presented in this thread.

21.<<<monydad>>>
"The reason why you're getting this reaction, monydad, is .."
because you are thin-skinned homers who cannot tolerate anyone mentioning anything whatsoever postive about another school? In fact I said one thing positive about Cornell, and nothing critical about Brown at all. If you think it is an insult to point out one thing positive about Cornell, when in fact it is, you will just have to be unhappy.

"..it is insulting "
Whatever insult you perceive is in your own head, it was nothing I said.

."..and I never posted any numbers"
poster kylerblood posted "numbers", in post # 10, and they were wrong.

22.<<<mgcsinc>>>
"[C]onsequently[,] Cornell's student body obviously has a much more diverse range of academic interests and characteristics. Many ultimately find the existence of the varied colleges to be a benefit. . . . But others may alternatively prefer more homogeneity."

To understand that as something positive about Cornell but neutral about Brown is ridiculous. No one misunderstands (except you, if we're to believe you) your cute little "oh, I'm not saying anything <i>bad</i> about Brown, it's great for people who like homogeneity" self-dialogue as anything other than what it is: shilling.

23.<<<monydad>>>
Again, that is your own interepretation, not mine. In fact, Cornell is frequently criticized for the heterogeneity of its student body, particularly as it impacts the range of aggregate test scores for the university taken as an aggregate, by people who attend more homogeneous schools, with more uniform admissions profiles, and prefer that.
I express no opinion on whether social heterogeneity is better than social homogeneity, I think reasonable people may differ on that point.
I noted that there is some difference, I did not "rank" which is better. Personally I don't know that it is necessarily "better" to be socially heterogeneous, FWIW. I think it's a point on which reasonable people may differ.

If you think heterogeneity is obviously superior, well that's definitely +1 for Cornell. But that''s your own value system talking, not necessarily mine, much less anyone else's. That's on you not me. I noted some differences I was aware of, people may variously weigh them, and undoubtedly other factors, as they see fit.

24.<<<jkiwmom>>>
Brown!!!!!!!!!!

25.<<<mgcsinc>>>
"If you think heterogeneity is obviously superior, well that's definitely +1 for Cornell."

Again, you are so adorable. I think it's obvious to everyone here what you do when you argue, but it seems like you might not be aware, so let me help you:

1. Start from an uncontested premise, like "heterogeneity is good", but pretend it's contested.

2. Define one of the words in your premise to favor Cornell. So, for example, redefine heterogeneity to favor inclusion of less qualified applicants but not to penalize frat-iness.

3. Wave your hands and say: "Therefore, if you are pro-heterogeneity, you'll of course prefer Cornell! Duh!"

4. Faux-cut-back on your own argument by saying: "Of course, if heterogeneity is not really your deal, then you could think about a place like Brown."

For the record, as long as you keep on spouting garbage in a place where kids are making a real earnest effort to figure out where to go to school, I'm going to keep calling you out on it.

26.<<<monydad>>>
Nothing I said is garbage. It is all true. People evaluating where to go to school should evaluate these real differences between the schools. IMO.

27.<<<swim2daend>>>
I looked through monydad's posts and he's doing this on multiple threads at different schools. Really I think we should just ignore him at this point. He sets his argument by picking out only what he wants to defend, ignoring the other points, to make his argument sound stronger. He also seems to be ignoring the fact that we're acknowledging Cornell as a fantastic school. I have been everything but offensive. I've been trying to defend Brown for you, monyday, are trying to make Brown seem like a terrible school. At this point, I'm not trying to beat you, but rather for you to just leave this place (and as extension, all the other threads you've hi jacked) and go back to the Cornell forum. It's just really unnecessary...

28.<<<monydad>>>
I said nothing that would suggest Brown is a terrible school, where do you get this stuff. Is "hijacking" the same as precisely addressing the question raised by the thread? Because that's what I did.

I am addressing Brown vs. Cornell. Some of you are addressing the precise phraseology of my posts, and parsing exactly what I intended at some deeper level.

I would say it is you who are hijacking.

29.<<<kylerblood>>>
Brown has the #1 happiest student body. Conversely, Cornell has the number one...let's nit even go there

30.<<<mgcsinc>>>
Yeah, we have a serious homogeneity of happiness problem at Brown . . .

Monydad: I say this a former debate judge, you are terrible at making an argument.

35.<<<cmburns14>>>
Well, Cornell is much stronger than Brown by research quality- no question about it. In every objective measure of faculty impact, Cornell ranks much higher than Brown.

Nobel Prizes:
Cornell 42, Brown 7

Members of the National Academy of Sciences
Cornell 34, Brown 7

Members of the National Academy of Engineering
Cornell 26, Brown 3

That said, Brown offers excellent undergraduate training for motivated students. Indeed, there are many talented students at Brown.

36.<<<Uroogla>>>
^It's important to note that Cornell does employ a little more than 3 times the faculty that Brown does, for a fair comparison.

I personally have never been impressed with the more renowned professors at Brown, but that likely varies by professor and probably is not correlated to the actual fame.

37.<<<Iheartschool12>>>
simple math: 7x3 = 21, 7x3 = 21, 3x3 = 9

38.<<<Uroogla>>>
I never claimed that the numbers ended with a higher ratio for Brown, just that the data needs that information for a fair comparison.

39.<<<Dad2>>>
No doubt about it: Brown is "hot" (USNWR notwithstanding), but it is in no way academically superior to Cornell, which boasts more renowned faculty and a more rigorous curriculum (touting the attendance of a movie star as proof of Brown's superiority is naive: one might argue that they want to go to a place where they won't have to work too hard, so as to balance with their lucrative film career). To give an historic perspective, Brown now is like Tufts a couple of decades ago- hot, but without quite the substance to put it up there with the top.

40.<<<mgcsinc>>>
^The above is completely unsourced dribble. Unaccessible renown faculty have nothing to do with academic superiority, and the attendance of an entertainer who has put her career on hold and who had demonstrated tremendous success in high school does little to support the ridiculous idea that Brown's curriculum is unrigorous just because it doesn't provide a series of poorly-designed crutches for students to lean on.

41.<<<lapras>>>
@Dad2: HE DOESN'T EVEN GO HERE!!!!

I'm kidding, but really, what gives you the right to say that Brown isn't rigorous? Did you go here and then transfer to Cornell and feel the difference? There's probably 2 or 3 people that try to use the open curriculum to their advantage and take "easier" classes, but I promise you there aren't 32 "easy" classes that can last you till graduation. Not to mention that if you call Brown "easy" in front of some of my friends (especially the ones in STEM majors), they will simply laugh at you. I don't see the list of majors on focal point and call any of them completely easy, especially when I've shopped some of the courses for them. Sure, you may call the MCM or English major a "joke," but a lot of the people that like to talk **** about those majors are people who probably can't even provide a concise literary analysis themselves, which is pretty LOLzy.

I love it how when movie stars go to school in the city (ala Columbia or NYU), it's them "balancing work with school by being in the city," but movie stars at Brown are just "lazy." Do you even know what courses Emma Watson is taking at Brown? Are you aware that there are celebrities OTHER than Emma Watson that go to other top universities that you could argue are also riding on the coattails of a brand name school?
You don't have the right to say that.

No offense, but the main reason I did not want to go to Cornell is because of location. I'm a NY native, and had no desire to stay in NY (especially if it was upstate). I visited and didn't like the size. Maybe I'm a lazy ****, but something about the way the school was set up didn't feel warm to me. The best part about my opinion, however, is it is individual to me. I bet people visit Brown and think "ew" and visit Cornell and are mesmerized. Because of this, people should visit schools and pick based on FIT. I don't give a **** if a school has 700 nobel laureate professors for classes I will never take; if I won't be happy there, I won't be going there.

42.<<<kylerblood>>>
Cornell is depressing which many assume means rigorous bevause all the people do there is work....its also not nearly as edgy or progressive as brown and has boring uninspiring students. Brown educates both the mind and the personality of its students. Also cornell is easy to get into and not up with the top as dad2 insinuates....can u say safety to the real ivies

43.<<<wolfmanjack>>>
Dad2, I'm not saying one is better than the other, but people like you sure make it lean toward Brown. There are people who transfer to and from all Ivy's for a variety of reasons. I came to Brown with people from Cornell and Dartmouth, for example. While at Dartmouth one summer I met a transfer from Brown, while I would never want to go there.

44.<<<modestmelody>>>
In this thread-- the reason I stopped posting on here.

45.<<<mgcsinc>>>
Rare modest sighting!

46.<<<wolfmanjack>>>
It is quite the gag fest.

47.<<<I V>>>
People need to stop this "Cornell is an Ivy League safety" talk. Yes, it does have a higher acceptance rate, but there are a good number of people who get into Dartmouth/Brown/UPenn that do not get into Cornell.

If the OP wants to base his decision purely on quantitative selectivity, then he should choose Brown; no question. Brown accepts about half the number of people Cornell does. You have finally gotten what you wanted Brown people: a Cornellian admitting that, in general, it is harder to get into Brown than it is to get into Cornell (though I am sure you already knew that).

However, I am pretty sure the OP did not mention selectivity as a part of his decision because BOTH schools are considered highly challenging to get into; employers aren't going to hire someone over someone else because they went to a school with an 8% lower acceptance rate.

I do not understand why Cornell/Brown people feel the need to fight over which school is better. There will never be an answer that question.

Visit both schools and then decide which one you like best.

48.<<<milkweed>>>
Brown- cooperative environment, happier students, less stress, open curriculum, can take s/nc (satisfactory/no credit classes). Medical school also in Providence.

Cornell- competitive, more stress, beautiful parks in Ithaca. Note the medical school is in NYC, so you won't be able to go to lectures/seminars as an undergrad. but there are lots of very good weekly seminars here in basic sciences.

I live in Ithaca, went to Brown, and my son is currently deciding between Oberlin (merit scholarship) and Brown. He didn't consider Cornell because he has heard students ofter feel anonymous and are very stressed.

49.<<<mrunderdog>>>
Cornell is not easy to get into lol, it's an ivy, prestigious, difficult to get into, and has the best engineering program out of all the ivies. The only reason it has a "higher acceptance rate" is because it's student body is the largest among all the ivies.

50.<<<airbag>>>
First, I'm embarrassed to see so much outrageous and accusatory analysis of monydad's posts--he merely provided information that was, to my understanding, quite true, without ever calling one school strictly "better" than the other.

A few years ago, my college decision came down to Brown and Cornell, and the most important factor I considered was how much academic control and flexibility I would have, since discovering my fields of interest was my top priority. While Cornell does indeed offer a more variegated course catalog, Brown offers flexibility and the ability to pursue very unique niches within large subjects, frequently offering courses at the undergraduate level that would generally only be available to graduate students at most other universities. I can attest to this because I transferred to Brown, so I have experience seeing how it compares to another top-ranked school.

In terms of location, atmosphere, and level of comfort on campus, I strongly prefer Brown, though Cornell is quite beautiful (during the early summer, at least). This should be a secondary factor when making your decision, and you will probably have intuitive opinions of your own after visiting both campuses.

To recap, I made my choice based on what was most important to me--having flexibility to explore different disciplines while also developing a strong specialty in a particular field. While these two approaches to academics may seem contradictory, I have been able to pursue both at Brown as a result of the Open Curriculum. For this reason, I have been able to achieve much more here than what would have been possible elsewhere.

In making this decision, I encourage you to think critically about the most important thing you want out of college, while secondarily considering location, atmosphere, and general campus vibe. Both schools offer good post-graduate opportunities, and I hope your visits help you make an informed decision.

^Who exactly are you responding to?

54.<<<LoremIpsum>>>
My son just returned from 2 days at Brown (ADOCH and STEM presentations). He talked to quite a few students (7-8) who were specifically deciding between Brown and Cornell, and they all told him it was going to be Brown. Perhaps it was just an usually great presentation or perhaps Brown is just more fun, but it seems a lot of kids were sold this week.

55.<<<I V>>>
I, likewise, have talked to several people at Cornell Days who were deciding between Brown and Cornell, and they were saying Cornell. Either way, both of our anecdotes are meaningless.

Statistically speaking, people choosing between Brown and Cornell pick Brown more often (I do not have an exact statistic, but I remember hearing something like 35-40% choose Cornell and 60-65% choose Brown in terms of cross admittance -- once again though, these are not exact statistics).

Either way, your decision should not be based off of the decisions other people are making for themselves. You should only be focused on yourself, and what you want. That is what college choices should always come down to.

56.<<<swim2daend>>>
^ That was before ADOCH lol

but yes Cornell is amazing and people are SO lucky to make this choice!!!!

57.<<<I V>>>
That they are... I'm almost glad I didn't get into Brown; I don't know how I would make the choice!

By the way, Cornell Days are actually still going on. They last until the 18th!

58.<<<oldfort>>>
My older daughter is graduating from Cornell this year. She feels she's had 4 best years there. I have frequent Cornell's forum, and read many posts there by current students. My younger daughter is a a junior in high school, she will be visiting Brown in a few days with her dad. I am here because of her interest in Brown (not in support of Cornell). I think school forums on CC is a great window to a school. I have to say, based on response on this forum, I am not impressed. I will wait for D2's feedback.

Monydad has 2 daughters who went to top tier LACs, and one ended up transferring to Cornell later. In that respect, he has been open minded about schools outside of Cornell.

Cornell and Brown are both very fine institutions, but very different. It does come down to fit. To say one is better than another is over looking at each institution's strength. On Cornell's forum, most posters use numbers to back up their statements, but not on this forum. Maybe that's the difference?

59.<<<Uroogla>>>
^ Admittedly, Brown's CC presence hasn't felt very representative of Brown's population to me.

With that said...I don't know anything about Cornell except that it was too large for me to consider but that I have a friend who was very happy after transferring there. I'd imagine they tend to attract very different types of students, based on location, the majors unique to Cornell, the Open Curriculum at Brown, etc. If one is lucky enough to be able to choose between the two of them, one can't really go wrong, as long as one puts in the thought. If it still feels like a toss-up, then both would probably be very good options. The Open Curriculum was vital to my decision, and I know that's the case with many students. Cornell has very good programs, particularly in Engineering. If one is bright enough to get into Brown and Cornell, one will be able to get quite a bit out of an education at either place. And that's really something that can't be objectified with numbers.

^^Look, if you can read monydad's posts and honestly understand them to reflect an openness toward both schools, then I don't know what to say. I think that I and the others who have responded here have done so only with respect toward Cornell and only after serious baiting by monydad. I'm not sure where in our responses you see unilateral support for Brown and rejection of the idea of 'fit'; to the contrary, it's exactly that sort of unilateral (though half-assedly-disguised) sort of support for Cornell that let to the reaction that some of us have toward monydad.

To the extent that you're looking for information about fit but want numbers to back up people's responses, you're not going to get what you want. The whole point of fit is that it isn't easily represented by numbers.

That says a lot about Cornell's students, if they feel that everything can be quantified with numbers. How exactly does one quantify general friendliness, a professor's sense of humor, a feeling of "wow! I <i>belong</i> here!"?

At every school there are professors with sense of humor. Cornell was the only school where D1 felt "wow! I belong here." Does it make Cornell a better or worse school than Brown? D2 may feel the wow when she visits Brown.

63.<<<mgcsinc>>>
^Exactly. That's why people were surprised that you seemed to be asking for numbers...

64.<<<oldfort>>>
When I brought up numbers I was implying that those statements were more fact based, not as much of touchy feeling, and certainly not with name calling. I have seen quite a few good, intelligent posts there over the years, and I have learned much from many current students and alumni of Cornell.

65.<<<wolfmanjack>>>
Listen, there are plenty of facts on here in longwinded exhaustive posts made by people over the years. Some of us are out of college and working, or in grad school, so the posts we make are much shorter.

In any case, Monydad's post's were hardly factual, and as mgsinc said if you don't see the issue with his posts you either a) don't truly understand what we are criticizing OR b) didn't read them.

In a thread like this "where should I go school" the OP will never get a good answer with a laundry list of facts. They are more typically a Q&amp;A with the OP in an attempt to get them started on making their own personal decision.

"fit" for brown means a desire to craft your own curriculum. that is a significantly different experience than most other schools. not right or wrong. just different. UC Santa Cruz used to have p/f...their motto for awhile (even on tshirts) was "no grades...thank you!" After some time they left the uber liberal no grades policy because they found that their grads had great difficulty getting into graduate schools. "no grades? no thanks!" The 1960's were left behind decades ago.

67.<<<wolfmanjack>>>
""fit" for brown means a desire to craft your own curriculum."

Actually it's not that simple.

Brown students hardly take all of their classes S/NC, and furthermore you can get a write-up from a prof for any course you take S/NC.

Not sure what the point of all that was, your amateurish **** isn't needed.

68.<<<4therez>>>
Brown is so much better than Cornell. And it's more prestigious

69.<<<chsowlflax17>>>
^Please stop. We really, really don't need this fight. We're both good schools and individual students who are lucky enough to get into both should choose whichever one most fits them, because that will determine whether they have a great experience or not.

Combine the following words together (eliminate all the space in between) as one whole URL link , you should be able to see the Ivy league + MIT's comparison results:

^Also, that site is crazy. For schools like Brown I'd suspect a large percentage of their posters are **** (look at Harvard's starting and 10-year salary data compared ot everyone else, for example).

74.<<<BigFire>>>
^Same applies to Dartmouth, you can call the posters are ****. You go to #1 school doesn't mean you can make more money than a school rank #8 or 9.

Anyway, this site is only a reference, you don't need to buy it.

75.<<<mrunderdog>>>
^ Never heard of that website. The world only cares about the USNWR, that's it.

Penn >>>>>>>>> Brown

76.<<<wolfmanjack>>>
You're STILL not getting it. No one at Brown or Penn really cares about USNWR. You are simply trying to make a decision and have grabbed onto the first silly publication that everyone knows about. Not too smart.

77.<<<BigFire>>>
Why Dartmouth graduates make more money -- probably has something to do with its exposure to wall street employment and networking. So i take the website as a reference.

Like the site said ---
Take salary information with a grain of salt -- they are dependent upon lots of factors.
(This data is not statistically reliable)

78.<<<mgcsinc>>>
The USNWR and salary stuff probably does something of a good job filtering out people who aren't right for Brown anyway -- not sure how much we should fight against it.

As to salaries in particular, Brown is simply always going to be ranked lower by virtue of the average goals of students at the school. When I got back from my first year at Brown, my friend who had started at the same time at Harvard couldn't stop talking about I-Banking and Wall St. firms. I had no idea what the hell he was talking about; at Brown, I don't think I heard a peep about either until my junior year. Perhaps it was just my group of friends -- the I-Banking thing seemed absolutely pervasive at Harvard, though.

For people who believe that a plenary desire to go into I-Banking and other high-earning fields straight out of school is a good indicator of where they should go to college, they very well may be better off not going to Brown.

I did notice on that posted weblink that Brown graduates had the highest job satisfaction rate -- and by quite a bit (89% vs 70% at Harvard). Money isn't everything, especially if your new bosses are going to work you like dogs until you burn out.

For a fun little look at what happens when you consider college solely in terms of how much earning potential it gets you, see this: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704132204576285471510530398.html?mod=googlenews_wsj" rel="nofollow">Allysia Finley: California Prison AcademyBetter Than a Harvard Degree - WSJ.com</a>

81.<<<wolfmanjack>>>
Now we know why California is broke. Anyway, like mgsinc said, some schools have a pervasiveness of business focus and less of everything else in the world. It's actually a little sad. Dartmouth seems that way to me.

82.<<<nlm2993>>>
I hope you chose Brown! I am a freshman at Cornell (for only 3 more weeks, woot woot!). I applied to Brown as a transfer student because Cornell isn't for me. Go BROWN! :)
