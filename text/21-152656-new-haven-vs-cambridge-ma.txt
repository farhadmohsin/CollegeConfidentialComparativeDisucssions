I have never been to New Haven, but I have spent a lot of time in Cambridge, MA. I was always under the impression that Harvard was located in the most unattractive spot for the Ivys (besides maybe UPenn). I was just wondering what New Haven was like in regards to:

2.<<<tkm256>>>
I'm not overly familiar with either location, but from my brief visits I will say that your definition of "attractive" is much different from mine. I preferred Boston to New Haven because of the culture. There's so much more to do, it seemed. But then, I'll probably lock myself on campus anyway so it doesn't matter as much as you'd think.

New Haven is slightly smaller and dirtier than Boston because there are fewer tourists, but overall one would be foolish to walk alone at night in either city. Since you say Cambridge and Philadelphia are the worst areas for ivys, I'm thinking you prefer rural (?) New Haven definitely isn't that.

Both universities take precautions for safety. Yale has the "blue lights" all over the place to push if you're in an emergency that needs attention within 30 seconds. Each is appealing and disappointing in its own way. I prefer the red brick and manicured lawns of Harvard, you might like the Gothic gray of Yale (it depressed me a little).

As for interaction: you'd have as much as you want to. Undergrads with humanitarian leanings will interact with it, but one can shut themselves up in the Ivy tower with no problems.

All this is from word of mouth, though, I'm not a real authority on urban areas. Dang SoCal boondock-suburbia.

New Haven is ghetto-fab

4.<<<edmYale09>>>
ghetto-fab is a great description haha. i love it.
all the fabulosity of an Ivy League town with the ghettoness of a city that was hit hard by the Crack Epidemic!

5.<<<Saintofme>>>
Hey, Philadelphia has gotten much better in recent years; Penn has been cited numerous times for the outstanding work it has done in neighborhood redevelopment, so much so that other colleges are now coming to Penn for advice. I think you would be surprised by how it has improved...I know that I was when I saw it.

I view this one as a fit question ... Harvard, Penn, and Columbia are all in big cities while Cornell and Dartmouth are in remote college towns and Princeton is in a suburb and Brown and New Haven are in smaller cities. Eaching setting has its pros and cons which will hit each applicant very differently.

7.<<<Madd Stressed>>>
How ghetto can a place in Conneticut be? And it's not like its huge or anything. Are there serious drug, gang and violence issues?

Connecticut is the richest state per capita in the US. Income levels are very similar to those in Luxembourg.

I wouldn't say New Haven is a reflection of that, but people who consider NH a ghetto generally have no idea of what a ghetto really is.

9.<<<dknicks2488>>>
true, but new haven is pretty bad. worse than nyc and boston by far.

10.<<<CautiousPessimism>>>
[quote]Connecticut is the richest state per capita in the US.[/quote]

Just a technicality, but since a year or two ago, I believe NJ became slightly higher. But yes, CT is still quite wealthy as a whole (not necessarily New Haven, though).

11.<<<masamune>>>
I personally like Cambridge more than New Haven. But this might be because I've spent 4 awesome months living there on my own.

Even still, people have told me that New Haven will grow on me. I really hope that's true, because Yale's location is the only thing that I can perceive to be a negative of Yale. I'm open to the change too, because I've practically lived my whole life in suburbia.

12.<<<ctgirl>>>
Most of New Haven is really, really nasty, but the area around the Yale campus is nice - lots of restaurants and shops. If you go a few blocks in the wrong direction, you're in the "ghetto". There are shootings once in awhile, but they are generally not close to the campus.

13.<<<jugartenis>>>
I go to school in a very bad part of north Philadelphia, and while New Haven certainly has some terrible areas, it's not quite as bad; that said, ctgirl is right in noting it's fairly bad outside a few block zone around Yale.

I can offer some decent if uneducated comparison between Cambridge and New Haven--while I don't go to school in either place yet I have visited each four times for their annual debate tournaments. The stereotypes about forensics are fairly true, so I can't really offer too much insight on the nightlife, but in terms of visual environment Yale wins hands down- much more actual greenspace, better architecture, and the immediate area of New Haven is much better than the area around Harvard (though Boston + Cambridge as a whole certainly trump New Haven).

Go to Yale though. It's much more awesome, as there are no Harvard students there (my primary motivation to choose Yale over Harvard: people).

14.<<<masamune>>>
Yeah, I'm going to Yale because I won't find Harvard students there ;)

15.<<<yb12>>>
Connecticut is the richest state per capita in the US because of Western Connecticut, which is more or less a suburb of NYC (towns like Greenwich). New Haven and Hartford are among the poorest cities in the nation. CT has a huge disparity between poor and rich. Found online: "According to the US 2000 Census, the population of New Haven is 123,626 people with a median household income of $29,604, compared to the state of Connecticut median household income of $53,935."

If you want an urban, lively lifestyle, Cambridge is a great location - better for a student, perhaps, than NYC or Philadelphia (all about personal preference, of course). I really like the atmosphere - Cambridge to Boston is rather like Greenwich Village to midtown Manhattan (on a smaller scale).

16.<<<Mexican Bulldog>>>
Now you're just being silly...

Of course New Haven is better than New York or Boston!

17.<<<edmYale09>>>
wow that last post was a lil much. haha. i love going into the city. and i'm looking forward to going up to Boston. let's just say New Haven is a nice oasis between NYC and Boston.

18.<<<Madd Stressed>>>
Getting onto Harvard people, I know that you guys were kind of kidding about them but seriously? What are the differences between Yalies and Harvard(err?)-ies. My impression from my parents (both Harvard, but definitely not stereotypical H students) is that Yalies were more artsy and 'flimsy' and and Harvard students were more competitive, selfish and pragmatic- but both were fairly arrogant. These stereotypes are probably completely outdated or wrong now though.

What are differences between the two student types in general?

19.<<<bashir7>>>
Not much. All great pple and well recognized anywhere they go all over the world. New haven would be New heaven if you were to get into Yale...

20.<<<conticuere>>>
As a Yale student who has spent a lot of time at Harvard, I can honestly say Cambridge is much better. It's almost inarguable.

21.<<<dukeclassof09>>>
As someone who is neutral on the topic, I have to say the Harvard's location is much better. As someone else mentioned, Yale is very close to the "ghetto" section of New Haven. If you go in one direction from the highway, it looks very nice and upscale, but not in the other direction.

Harvard's area (Cambridge) seemed like a very good setting for a college. There is nothing "unattractive" about the area, and it's certainly much better than many of the other Ivy college locations, especially New Haven, Philadelphia, and Harlem. With that said, I thought Yale's campus was significantly nicer than Harvard's.

22.<<<posterX>>>
So, New Haven vs. Cambridge, from someone who has lived in both places:

Both are great college towns (obviously - Yale and Harvard are easily the two most selective universities in the country and their locations are a major factor in this), but New Haven is a better college town than Cambridge. The main reason is that the area of Cambridge around Harvard empties out on weekends, and the Harvard campus is dead, because it isn't the center of student life for the area. Students go elsewhere to party, and also the fact that Harvard's campus is much more spread-out than Yale's is a problem. Yale is the complete opposite. Yale's campus is very busy all weekend, partly because there is probably more to do in terms of theater and shows and the campus is more compact, but also because the area of New Haven around Yale is the center of student life for all the colleges in the region. If you go around parts of downtown New Haven (where Yale is) on weekends, you'll see there are literally hundreds of stores, restaurants, sushi bars, a brand-new multiplex cinema, nightclubs etc. that students go to, whereas Harvard's area is sort of dead by comparison (to be fair, there are a few good pubs and a couple of good pizza shops around Harvard, and a good movie theater, but it isn't the same).

Of course, Boston obviously has more colleges, since it's a larger city, but New Haven has tens of thousands of college students, too. For example, Harvard is the largest university in Cambridge by enrollment, but Yale is not the largest university in New Haven by enrollment - Southern Connecticut State is.

In terms of safety, Harvard is more dangerous:

<url>http://www.stalcommpol.org/data.html</url>

But both campuses are in large urban areas, and obviously students should take some precautions when venturing away from either campus, or late at night on either campus. There are occasionally crimes against students at both Harvard and Yale, but not much more than at a lot of other schools, even rural or suburban schools. The crime seems exaggerated because the universities are closely-knit, people know each other, and there is a constant media spotlight which means you hear about crimes, even small ones (in places like New York City, there can be crimes going on right across the street but chances are you will never hear about them). So, yes, the New Haven and Cambridge/Boston areas both have bad parts of town, obviously, but both also have extremely wealthy areas. Boston has very expensive housing because it is a large city, and a lot of old-money wealth. Connecticut is the richest state in the country by far, and has the highest percentage of Ph.D.'s per capita in the country, and much of that spills over into New Haven, which you'd see if you look at some of the restaurant menus in the downtown area. Be careful comparing any statistics about cities (including even things like population numbers), especially these ones -- the city boundaries of New Haven and Boston are drawn in a very outdated way making it impossible to really compare them to other cities. If you drew the city boundaries of New Haven like San Antonio draws its boundaries, for example, New Haven would be the 8th largest city in the country with a population approaching two million people.

One thing visitors sometimes notice to either place is the homeless population. The reason that homeless people hang out near Yale and Harvard is because they are the safest places, and the only places they are welcome, in the region. Yale and Harvard have lots of pedestrians relative to the areas that surround them (which are much more suburban), which makes it much safer for people, including the homeless, to hang out by the campus. Also, it's the only place panhandlers can make money. Studies have been done that show only about 25% of the homeless people in college towns (areas like the ones around Harvard and Yale) are actually from that area - most have come there because it is where they feel welcome.

In terms of accessibility to the countryside, quieter areas, beaches, hiking trails, etc., New Haven wins hands-down over Cambridge because it is a smaller city. The "edge" of urban sprawl in New Haven is really close to the center, meaning you can ride a bike or even walk out to areas with dozens of miles of hiking trails, whereas in Boston you need to drive at least an hour out to get into nicer rural areas. Of course, Cambridge has a larger city within immediate access (Boston), but I think Yale more than makes up for that by being so close to New York City, which puts Boston to shame. The real comparison is New York versus Boston, since both Yale and Harvard are within those larger metropolitan regions (although for college students both schools benefit by not being in the center of the megacities - being in the center of a huge city like that completely kills all campus life whatsoever). Anyways, in this sense, Yale easily wins because New York City is hundreds of times more interesting, diverse, exciting and educational than Boston will ever be.

In terms of student interaction with the city, both places offer a lot of opportunities for getting involved but Yale wins here, too. The reason is that it's a smaller city, so much more welcoming to student involvement, and also because the Yale campus is literally across from New Haven's City Hall and central business district, on the 400-year old town green. I can't think of any other universities that have such a close, accessible relationship with such a large host city like Yale does. Harvard is part of a much larger city and it's much more difficult to get directly involved with something politically important (and educational)!

23.<<<bandit_TX>>>
Harvard to Boston - 10 minutes on the T
Yale to NYC - 2 hours on the train

24.<<<posterX>>>
But that's like saying:
10 [or 20] minutes to a city smaller than and about as interesting as Novosibirsk, Russia

[less than] 2 hours to a city larger and better than Paris and London combined.

25.<<<Mexican Bulldog>>>
conticuere - I don't believe you go to Yale. That was a very lazy dismissal of New Haven. You wouldn't do that if you were really here.

26.<<<Saintofme>>>
"I can't think of any other universities that have such a close, accessible relationship with such a large host city like Yale does."

Penn is within the city of Philadelphia and a 15 minute walk to Center City or a 10 minute subway ride.

27.<<<goldoro99>>>
great post, posterx, very thorough. ive lived in new haven (not at yale) for a summer and i can say it was not a particularly pleasant experience. new haven needs yale in order to be vibrant and exciting--which it certainly is during the school year, with all the shops, clubs and restaurants right nearby that are constantly buzzing with yalies. and i would have to agree about the proximity to new york vs. proximity to boston. i go to new york about four times a semester, its really not a hassle, yale organizes trips down there all the time, and its a gajillion times better than boston.

28.<<<posterX>>>
Philadelphia's government is a much larger organization - the city government isn't going to allow Penn undergrads to just walk in and start doing major projects, even as freshmen. Also, they'd have to compete with Temple, Drexel, etc.

29.<<<sarit_om>>>
"How ghetto can a place in Conneticut be? And it's not like its huge or anything. Are there serious drug, gang and violence issues?"

In New Haven, there are gangs all over the place, shootouts every once in a while, and really - it goes from beautiful gothic architecture to a dangerous ghetto in no time.

Yes, I believe he was. However, I would personally be fascinated with Novosibirsk, Russia. It's such a different culture.

You know, at this point, I really don't care whether New Haven is better than Cambridge or Philadelphia trumps them both. As long as it's not my hometown, I'll be happy.

32.<<<edmYale09>>>
As for New Haven and gangs, I haven't really seen that. I just see petty crime.

37.<<<la_vie_est_belle>>>
I know people who prefer New Haven and I know people who prefer Cambridge. It really comes down to personal preference so those of you making the Harvard vs. Yale decision should really visit both towns to get your own impression.

Here are the five things I like best about each place, many of which have already been mentioned by others.

New Haven:

1) Nature is much more accesible w/out a car. East Rock park is only 1 mi from campus. There is also West Rock and Magby resevoirs 3miles away.

2) Great, cheap ethnic restaurants are very close/on campus. It's so easy to get a delicious $5-10 meal. Food trucks are great. Good, cheap food is hard to find in Cambridge.

3) Cost of living is a lot less. $600 dollars gets you a nice 1 bedroom apt in New Haven vs. $1000 in Cambridge. This is important if you're looking to spend summers on campus or move off campus.

4) Yale has a School of Music and a School of Drama so there are tons of free/ cheap performances on campus. There is more going on in the Boston area each night, but it generally involves a T-ride which adds time and planning. In New Haven, I went the concerts once a week; now in Cambridge, it's more like once a semester.

5) There are a lot of community service opportunities in Cambridge and Boston, but at Yale they tend to be closer to/affiliated with the campus.

Cambridge:

1) Shopping is great in Boston! So many more stores for clothes, specialty food items, etc. No more mail order!

2) People want to visit you more often because you're in a "big" city with more tourist activities.

3) Lots of clubs and activities not directly affliated with your school to join. Music groups, running clubs, etc. But as a student, there's not much time to partake in this...

4) Boating is a lot more accessible in Cambridge. If you like sailing or crew, the Charles River is awesome and nearby whereas the Yale Yatch Club and the Boat House are each about a 25 min drive from campus.

5) The social life seems less campus centered in Cambridge than in New Haven.

38.<<<sleet>>>
The thread is getting pretty exhaustive on the topic, but I do want to mention:

-I tried hard to find the article, and could not, but about a month ago, the Dean of Student Affairs of Harvard College was cited in the Yale Daily News saying things that amounted to "the amount of crime in Cambridge is very comparable to than in New Haven" and "Don't get me wrong - Cambridge can be quite dangeous." I don't know why she said those things, but she did. It was an entertaining read for a Yalie.

-There are Yalies that b|tch and complain about New Haven and those that make the best of it in a way one could not do with a larger place. You realize there is a limited selection of clothing retailers in walking distance, so you take your pick of J Press, J Crew, and Urban Outfitters and you stick with it. There are no endless shopping opportunities to distract you from your studies :)

-Yes, New Haven just wouldn't be the same without Yale, but you kind of become proud of Yale's role if you're economically progressively minded. Yale is smack in the downtown of New Haven and owns a big chunk of the commericial real estate including all of Broadway and most of Whitney Avenue. Those places are neatly manicured and leave you wondering where New Haven got its bad rep. Yale owns a bunch of random apartment housing and keeps buying more and works with the city to develop subsidized home ownership programs. Measures like these help lift the city's image in many ways.

- The fairly ghettoey places that remain are quite a walk away. Someone mentioned "across the highway." I don't recall ever seeing or hearing of a Yalie going over there. If you're headed in the direction however, the Wooster Street neighborhood is one of the oldest and most interesting, far from ghetto. If you venture as far as Fair Haven going on Grand Avenue, you'll see the paradigm signs of a ghetto soon enough, though. But if you make it over the Q-Pac River you'll be in the clear again. The section of Derby Avenue from passing the Yale Bowl to around Dwight Street isn't so pleasant either which closely relates to the area west of campus being risky. And the Dixwell Ave direction too, I guess, is one to be cautious in.

-There's ample night clubs and liquor stores in New Haven :) - CLub Image, and the club on College St are good choices and if one considers BAR a club that's good too. And of course Toad's can't be missed.

-There is a shortfall with movie theaters. I'd say even Hanover, NH beats us there...there is one really fancy movie theater nearby, but it only shows indie flicks. Since York Street Cinemas went under, you pretty much have to catch a bus to go to a mainstream movie theater, although the Med School Film Society makes up in part by screening good films about a month after they stop playing in the mainstream theaters.

That's my take on New Haven. I'm not in too much of a position to evaluate Cambridge, having only been twice.

39.<<<posterX>>>
There is no shortfall of movie theaters there. There is a very large cineplex less than two blocks away from the Yale freshman quad, on a street lined with dozens of restaurants, diners and shops, that shows many first run movies as well as the top recent foreign films. It is doing so well that they are expanding and adding several additional screens. There are literally dozens of other movie theaters within a 10 minute bus trip or car ride.

40.<<<conticuere>>>
I'm sorry but as a Yale student I'm going to have to contradict PosterX. There's only one, very small movie theater on Temple Street that has about 5 or 6 theaters. It does not usually have all the big movies and usually carries the more artistic ones.

People who review films for the YDN are forced to take a taxi ride to the North Haven theater, a 40 dollar ride overall back and forth (though they get reimbursed), in order to see their films. Rarely, they even go to New York to see them on their debut. So, indeed, seeing the top movies here is often expensive and impossible for most students.

41.<<<posterX>>>
Actually, the theater on Temple Street is not small at all - it's so large it even has its own liquor license. And it shows a number of first-run films. Right now, for example, it is showing Match Point. It was the first theater in CT to show that movie. As far as premieres go, new movies now often premiere in New York, Connecticut and Los Angeles and the reason is that theater on Temple Street. It used to be just NY and LA that got the new movies about a week before they came out in the rest of the country.

Also, I don't know why Yale students would take a taxi ($20 each way to a theater on the edge of town) when there is a bus that charges $1.25 and gets there in 15 minutes, and also goes to a number of other theaters in the area in about 15 minutes. Especially with the theater on Temple Street and all of the film societies at Yale that show films a couple months after they come out for $3. Visit the CTTransit website. Spoiled Yalies?

42.<<<conticuere>>>
You're wrong. Criterion is very small. Occaisonally it has a new release...but it only has what 5 theaters? It's just a little theater! Reviewers for the YDN MUST go to other cinemas by bus or taxi in order to get there on time and see the movies they have to review. You simply are not informed here.

43.<<<sleet>>>
Yes, Criterion is nice and fancy, but it simply doesn't play the top hit films. I really don't know why.

44.<<<posterX>>>
Criterion is adding two new 180-seat theaters, which will enable it to have even more first-run films. It is easily one of the best movie theaters in the Northeast.

45.<<<studyless>>>
Granted I haven't been to many theaters in the Northeast, but Criterion is a joke compared to most theaters I have been to. I mean its great that there is a decent movie theater in downtown New Haven, but it isn't that nice. Also, the suburban movie theaters around New Haven have apparently conspired to prevent first-run mainstream movies from playing in downtown New Haven (I have no idea if this is true or not, but read this <url>http://www.azothgallery.com/yorksquare.html</url> for more info). Even with its new theaters, Criterion will still probably target its niche of arthouse movie goers.

The point is, New Haven is not a real city. I mean it has most things that one would need, but it does not come close to comparing with Boston and New York is far enough away to make it mostly accessible only for infrequent day trips. If being in or near a real city is most important to you, then New Haven is going to be a dealbreaker for you compared to Cambridge. For most people, the added pluses of Boston won't really be missed too much, but if you absolutely NEED to have easily accessible malls/movie theaters/concerts (Toad's sometimes gets good stuff, but most acts skip New Haven) then you really shouldn't have applied to Yale in the first place because New Haven will come up short.

46.<<<paperfish154>>>
What about Providence? Anyone know something about New Haven vs. Providence? I've been told it's had a renaissance of sorts in the past 10 years or so, but I really haven't had enough experience with New Haven or Providence to compare the two. Any comments?

47.<<<Byerly>>>
"Two decades ago, Providence, Rhode Island, was a gritty wasteland of neglected waterways, derelict railroad yards, and vast parking lots derided as a smudge on the road from New York to Cape Cod. Today, this historic New England city boasts a lively panorama of graceful river walks, revived commercial activity, and celebrated public artsand has been named among the best places to live in America.

This breakthrough portrayal of urban rebirth reveals the ideas, opportunities, people, and projects behind the twenty-five-year Providence renaissance. Laying the historical, economic, and political groundwork, Francis J. Leazes Jr. and Mark T. Motte describe in detail the many disparate events that came together to transform Providences downtown into one of the nations most attractive urban environments at a time when other nearby former industrial centers, such as Fall River, Hartford and New Haven, continued to decay despite valiant renewal efforts. Through extensive interviews with elected officials, civil servants, entrepreneurs, and citizen activists, a complete picture takes shape for the first time of the myriad actors, complex goals, and intergovernmental cooperation involved in developing such lauded successes as the new Capital Center, the Providence Place mall, and the award-winning light sculpture, WaterFire.

Featuring dozens of illustrations, including many striking before-and-after images, the book reveals that the Providence renaissance is far more than mere smoke and mirrors perpetrated by flamboyant former mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci. Leazes and Motte employ the "garbage can" policymaking model to show how contingent coalitions, made up of public and private sector leadership, can adapt more effectively than a single grand redevelopment scheme or market-driven privatization alone. The evidence uncovers a true comeback of a city solidly remade, not merely a grimy urban skeleton with a postmodern veneer.

Meticulously documented and engagingly written, Providence, the Renaissance City is the authoritative account of one citys dramatic new beginning. It will be valuable reading for policymakers, administrators, political scientists, urban planners, and all concerned citizens of our nations cities."

48.<<<studyless>>>
Having spent a summer at Brown and going to Yale, I will say that Providence is slightly nicer (the downtown mall really is a plus) but there is not too much difference at least in terms of what each city has to offer. You would still have to go to Boston to get a significant city advantage over New Haven.

49.<<<mensa160>>>
Providence isn't as charming, and New Haven is not as doleful as the popular myths would have us believe. They are both prosaic New England cities with fine universities as their cultural centers. Boston is a big East Coast city, with most of the advantages and all of the negatives one would expect.

50.<<<posterX>>>
New Haven beats Providence any day. New Haven at its center has the city government/civic downtown, nightlife center for 10s of thousands of area college students, as well as Yale, whereas in Providence, Brown sits up on a hill away from downtown. As a result, Yale has much more to do in the immediate area and the area stays open much later.

Also, New Haven is within the New York City metro area, connected by about 50 commuter trains per day, making it easily accessible via daytrip (and Boston is also very close). Providence doesn't have any significant distance advantage relative to Boston, but is much, much, much farther from New York.

51.<<<studyless>>>
Providence is only an hour from Boston, while New Haven is at best 1 hour and 40 minutes from New York (assuming the Metro North trains run on time which is not always the case). Day trips are pretty much impossible from Providence to New York and New Haven to Boston as they are both about 3 hours from each other. Yes, New York is a more exciting city, but Boston is pretty good (especially for a college student). The extra 80 minutes you save on a roundtrip is pretty nice too and makes day trips a lot easier.

Also, most of the college oriented stuff in Providence is up near Brown on Thayer St. and the downtown of Providence (at least from the Main Green of Brown to the mall in the middle of downtown) is at most 10 or 15 minutes (or like from Science Hill at Yale to Pierson College).

52.<<<posterX>>>
Normally, when driving, New Haven is less than an hour and a half from New York and less than two hours from Boston (Providence is an out-of-the-way city and you normally bypass it going from New York to Boston, via Hartford, so the comparison you made is not valid). There are also express trains that are faster.

In addition to Boston being utterly boring when compared with New York (it's even worse than comparing say, Paris to a small, provincial city like Toulouse - there's no real comparison), going to Boston is a hassle because Boston is spread out and does not have a public transit system even remotely comparable to New York's subway system. It's a bunch of infrequent trolleys that stop running at midnight. That's also a reason why much of Boston shuts down very early and on weekends, while New York is a 24 hour city.

It's good that Providence has a large shopping mall, but it's kind of sad considering the state had to entirely fund its construction, and also the extreme segregation there between the rich stores and "lower" level makes it kind of depressing, in my opinion. Plus, it is just a bunch of chain stores that can be found anywhere. It's not at all integrated with Brown or downtown Providence the way that New Haven's more unique shopping &amp; restaurant areas are integrated with the campus and rest of the city.

53.<<<mensa160>>>
Really, the city that kicks ass over all of these is Washington DC. Its more manageable than New York, but has almost as many great museums and parks. Georgetown is just about the perfect location, with incredible restaurants, nightclubs and interesting retail stores, featuring everything from second-hand vintage clothing to boutiques. George Washington University is in Foggy Bottom, not too far from the White House and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, not quite as charming as Georgetown, but also with great restaurants and shopping. Both Georgetown and Foggy Bottom are really alive at night. American University is in a very prosperous area of Northwest Washington within easy walking distance to the Metro subway. Catholic University is kind of away, but the campuses beautiful, as is that of Howard University.
