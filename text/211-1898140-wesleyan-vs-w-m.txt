I have finally narrowed down my options to these two schools. And I hope you can rate the following criteria out of ten with a comment or review. (Btw I’m an Chinese international student who has studied in a US private school for 3 years. I don’t have any financial aid or scholarships, just straight up full tuition).

Academics (I'm not likely to major in science or engineering at least for now)
Reputation/Prestige (among top grad schools and companies)
Location 
Facilities and resources
Value of cost
Safety
Outcome/opportunities (chance to get into top grad schools/career development)
Food and dorm
Quality of life
Athletics

If you think of anything else that is necessary to consider, please add them to the list.
I’ve been doing research and consulting current students for the past few days and I’m leaning toward Wes. I just wanna get more insights. Any input would be deeply appreciated! Thanks!

2.<<<circuitrider>>>

Academics - Wesleyan has a lower student/faculty ratio, but, that's not surprising since it is a private university. You can get a great non-STEM education at either place.
Reputation/Prestige - top graduate schools and employers are aware of both schools.
Location - W&M hands-down, the winner. Nothing quite like being part of a historic Colonial restoration project.
Facilities and resources - Again, I don't think either school has a clear advantage here. Once you step off the mainly historic quads, the facilities get quite modern.
Value of cost - Here's where it gets dicey. You're probably paying OOS tuition for a public university at W&M. For essentially the same amount of money you would be sharing space with three times the number of total students (grad and undergrad) and larger classes than you would at Wesleyan. Also, not to put too fine a point on it - two thirds of your classmates at W&M will be from the same state.
Safety - Crime is a scary thing whenever it happens, especially on a quiet campus. According to Clery Statistics Wesleyan has a big lead in reported rape cases. Some people argue that it is because Wesleyan does a better job at encouraging people to report such occurrences. Either way, it's not a pretty statistic 
Outcome/opportunities (chance to get into top grad schools/career development) - IMO, it depends on what you make of your opportunities (i.e., grades and test scores.)
Food and dorm - Wesleyan has an unusual graduated independent living approach to student housing with hundreds of small houses dotting the campus. I'm guessing W&M has more conventional dorms.
Quality of life - I've heard great things about the level of student satisfaction at both places.
Athletics - Not clear what you are looking for here.

If you are interested in participating in intercollegiate athletics, then this is much more likely at Wesleyan. Wes is a much smaller school, yet sponsors more varsity teams. Furthermore, the bar for athletic talent is relatively low, since Wes is a Division III school. So Wes has lots of athletic participation: about 21.5% of enrolled students are varsity athletes. The rate for W&M is much lower, only about 8.2%.
If you are interested in following intercollegiate athletics as a fan, then W&M is better, because it is a Division I school with serious athletes playing on athletic scholarships. However, the difference may not be great as you might expect. W&M plays football at the D1-FCS level, which is still “minor league” as far as the average college football fan is concerned. W&M is theoretically eligible for the NCAA basketball tournament, but has never actually qualified. So W&M sports, while entertaining, aren’t generally featured prominently on national media, as UVa or Virginia Tech games might be.

5.<<<Corbett>>>

Funk

If you are going to compare these two particular schools, you should really be aware of the pronounced differences in funkiness. Wes is generally regarded as a pretty funky place. At W&M, the “historic Colonial restoration project” atmosphere has its charms, but is arguably deficient in terms of bringing the funk.

6.<<<tk21769>>>
For a tourist, Williamsburg is definitely a  more interesting place to visit than Middletown, CT.  However, you can tour Williamsburg in about a day, then when the novelty wears off, you’re out in the boondocks 2.5 hours from Washington DC. Middletown is roughly the same distance to NYC, but maybe a little less to Boston and fairly close to many other college campuses. On balance, I think I’d prefer Wesleyan’s location … but not for ~$10K/year more (if location were the only difference that mattered to me).

[/QUOTE]

LOL. I’ve been following @jackwang0703 for exactly one year now and his thinking process has been remarkably consistent: academics, location and prestige, in that order. I think @Corbett is the first poster to ever ask him how he plans on having fun.  

8.<<<IzzoOne>>>
I think they are roughly comparable schools in reputation, academics.  W&M is over twice as large, public, and is in a different area (Mid-Atlantic vs New England).  If you could visit, you would probably get a sense for which you prefer.  If you cannot, I believe both have reputations for having relatively happy student bodies.

9.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@circuitrider So how should I change my thinking process?

10.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@Corbett What do you mean by funk? Could you elaborate on that? I’m sorry I’m not a native speaker.

11.<<<admissionsrep93>>>
The “funk” is referring to the students at Wesleyan and the type of school it is. Although a great institution with tons of talent, their process and classes, along with many of the people are very “out there” and not in the good way. I have heard too many stories of the social hardships and turning to intense drugs (not sure if you heard of the overdose story of students last year). It’s a tough place to live and the community or Wesleyan doesn’t make it any better. W&M on the other hand has an amazing community, bigger but stronger, and a much better town. Same distances from the major city, same academics (both semi hands on if that’s what you want) and W&M just has a statistically better “college life”. In every respect I would choose W&M over Wesleyan.

You misunderstood me. Your thinking process was fine. It got you from where you started which was with a list of two dozen colleges with virtually nothing in common except that they were all excellent colleges and universities, to where you are today with a tough decision between two excellent American colleges. Your parents must be very proud.
But, I’m curious: What do you do for fun?

13.<<<Corbett>>>

[quote]

[/quote]

W&M is a school that is rooted in history and tradition, going back to the 17th Century. It is so old and full of history – perhaps more than any other US school – that the campus is almost a museum. W&M students tend to embrace this heritage.
Wesleyan, on the other hand, has students that are known for rejecting tradition, and experimenting with new ideas, even ideas that may initially seem crazy. Funky = new, different, crazy; could be either good or bad. Wesleyan is perhaps funkier than another US school.
So these two schools – though both academically strong – have very different “personalities”. W&M is known for heritage and tradition; Wesleyan is known for unconventional thinking and behavior. You wanted info on ten criteria – yet none of your criteria addressed what many people would see as the most obvious and important difference between the two schools.

14.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
W&M would be full of middle/upper-middle-class typically nerdy/geeky NoVa kids.
I’ll defer to what everyone else says about Wes.

15.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@circuitrider Oh that’s what you meant. Thank you then. Well, for international students from China, we tend to look at schools only by their rankings. And that definitely shapes our thinking process.
I probably portray myself as a pretty typical Asian/Chinese on this site, but I don’t normally study a lot or very hard. I basically just muddled through my super competitive middle school in Shanghai usually in the top 30-40% without much dedication.
So what do I do for fun? I watch movies in the movie theatres, go to different types of concerts, see some drama or plays once in a while, play basketball and tennis sometimes, go to the gym to work out every day in summer when I’m in Shanghai, try out different restaurants with family and friends, and most importantly, travel. I have traveled a lot with my parents and it has become a family tradition. I’ve visited over 15 countries in Europe, Asia, and America by far. There’s nothing like being physically present in a foreign land to discover everything that you might have heard other people talking about. I learned various cultures, removed stereotypes, and perceived my own country from a new perspective. I just love traveling. It has and will continue to help me become more cosmopolitan.
Hopefully that answers your question.

16.<<<admissionsrep93>>>
I highly disagree with some of people’s descriptions on W&M. It is traditional, true, but their learning experience and philosophies require for great intellectual thinking as well as new and informed thought processes. Aside from that there are many flaws within Wesleyan such as a huge influx in tuition and only 2 credits of AP transfers. W&M is just the better choice.

17.<<<circuitrider>>>
Thanks, @jackwang0703 . I was worried that your head would explode at Wesleyan. But, far from it. I think you are well prepared for its “funkiness”.

18.<<<Corbett>>>

[quote]

[/quote]

I don’t think that either W&M or Wes is inherently a “better choice”. But I do think that Wes (for better or worse) is a significantly funkier place than the College of William and Mary, and that an informed decision about the two schools should include consideration of this point.
I would say the same thing if someone was comparing, say, Reed College vs. Washington & Lee. They are both highly regarded LACs, with comparable admissions standards, and each can be a great fit for the right person. But most people would have a distinct preference for one school or the other, and this is in part because one school is much funkier than the other.

19.<<<jackwang0703>>>
Now I’m starting to consider the more diverse yet still fairly traditional, Richmond again, in comparison to W&M.
The reason I didn’t completely take Richmond out of the list is that it has the best reviews on Niche in terms of quality of life including food, dorm, campus, location.
I’m not sure about its academics though. I know it probably has the best business program among the three, but as far as academics and prestige in general, I think it is at a lower level perhaps slightly. I made that assumption based on various rankings and some friends’ opinions.

20.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Don’t put so much weight on rankings. Most Americans just don’t. Richmond definitely is on the same tier as W&M.
@Corbett: You definition of “funky” is strange. I’d say Reed is similar to W&M in that they both have intellectual students and rigorous/tough courses but good teaching while W&L is definitely conservative old money (a bit like Richmond) and Wes is out there (funky).

21.<<<admissionsrep93>>>
Had no idea Richmond was in the races! Richmond is absolutely incredible for what you would want to study, if that is buisness, and aside from that it is everything W&M is and more, just without the rankings for some odd reason, I do agree and see that. If rankings matter to you, do W&M, if not Richmond is an excellent choice!

22.<<<circuitrider>>>
@jackwang - Believe me, downtown Richmond makes Middletown, CT look positively cosmopolitan by comparison. You will either need a car for quick trips to Washington, D.C. or satisfy yourself with living in a bubble - a comfortable bubble - but, one that pretty much has to import all of its entertainment because hardly anyone majors in the arts. Subtract the approximately 1,100 business and marketing majors from U Richmond’s student body and you have the smallest number of liberal arts students among any of the colleges on your short list.

23.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@circuitrider Oh really? So W&M might be more like an LAC compared to Richmond in this sense. Since so few people major in the arts, does that make any programs other than business less strong and promising? Then W&M might be a better place for a more balanced undergrad education. Isn’t it always ranked among the best undergrad teaching by USNEWS?
And my friend at Wesleyan, who had visited W&M to see her friends couple times, told me that W&M is indeed more traditional than Wes in every aspect, but not conservative. I think I’m more traditional even though I might appear to be kinda liberal. I always follow the rules and don’t really try to take any unconventional route. I’m not creative or innovative either. I think I’m like a 30-40% liberal, 60-70% traditional.
And about the location, my friend said Williamsburg is better and more convenient than Middletown. It has easier access to supermarket. And it has warmer weather if you don’t like the cold. Is it convenient to get around from Williamsburg, to DC, for example?

24.<<<prezbucky>>>
Enter George Clinton.
“Weeee want the funk…”
Yes, Wes is more extreme, more in-your-face, and it does bring the funk, based on what so many say about it.
I hadn’t thought about it in that term, but that’s what it is: funk. Funkadelic funkiness is fashionable at Wes.
“Attitude” also comes to mind, as does “opinionated”. Or… “radical”.
W&M does evoke images of the staid, the old, the reserved, the proud, the traditional, the historic. These are all fine things, painting a very dignified picture.
If these were people:

Wes is the messy kid who makes it to a political protest, a punk concert, writes a play and gets hammered all in the same day, and then sleeps half of the next day, doesn't shower, and eats Ramen noodles for lunch and dinner -- or just dinch.
William and Mary are the Vineyard Vines-donning clean couple who plan well, study hard, stick to schedules, have 2.3 kids, listen to the pop station, and think it's too scandalous to let their parents think they're doing it, let alone tell them. They dare each other to cuss, just for a bit of excitement.

(no, W&M isn’t that straight-laced… it just looks that way next to Wes.)

25.<<<Corbett>>>
@PurpleTitan: Reed is indeed intellectual and rigorous, but every bit as unconventional and “out there” as Wesleyan, if not more so. For example, I invite you to consider their impressive ranking on the Princeton Review’s List of “Birkenstock-Wearing, Tree-Hugging, Clove-Smoking Vegetarians”:
https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=tree-hugging-vegetarians
You might also take a look at the Reed College Bookstore’s best-selling “classic” T-shirt:
http://bookstore.reed.edu/shop_product_detail.asp?catalog_group_id=MzA&catalog_group_name=Q2xvdGhpbmc&catalog_id=650&catalog_name=VGVlcyBBbmQgUG9sb3M&pf_id=101013&product_name=Q2xhc3NpYyBUZWUgV2l0aCBDb21taWUgU2VhbA&type=1&target=shop_product_list.asp
Not funkier than W&L ?

26.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
No, Reed and W&L are very different, but I wouldn’t use them as proxies for Wes and W&M because I consider Reed and W&M closer to each other than either are to W&L and Wes, and those last two are polar opposites.

27.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@prezbucky I think it might be a little hard for me to fit in Wes than W&M considering school vibe. What about Richmond? I heard almost everybody there only study or care about business. However, interestingly enough, it has the highest rated reviews on all review websites compared to Wes or W&M.

28.<<<prezbucky>>>
Richmond is another fine school. It might fall somewhere in between W&M and Wes on the funkmeter.
(Kidding aside, kids like to have fun everywhere, and there is diversity of personality/experience/preference/prerogative at every school. There are probably even some straight-laced kids at Wes. Don’t let our whimsy dissuade you from Wes or W&M.)

29.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@prezbucky I will try my best. What about academics at Richmond compared to the others?

I think that’s correct. This is not a knock against the liberal arts departments at U Richmond. I just don’t think they are the main reason people go there.

Needing a supermarket presupposes that you are cooking for yourself. And, I just don’t see W&M competing with Wesleyan in terms of food culture. It’s a real thing at Wesleyan. There are a lot more grad students at W&M and, obviously, they shop somewhere, but, it’s not quite the same thing as having an entire subgroup of undergraduates who can have friends over for dinner and the constant foot traffic that generates over the course of a weekend. FWIW, there’s a convenience store on campus and a natural food store downtown.

@circuitrider I’m 18 btw. And I was asking is it easy to travel to DC from Williamsburg?

32.<<<prezbucky>>>
I don’t know enough to give you a detailed response about Richmond’s academics.
I know that Richmond has a business school, which is fairly rare among LACs – most have Econ but lack business  schools and business-related majors. Econ is just one part of a Business degree – other main topics include areas like Marketing, Finance, Accounting, and Operations.
I’d say Richmond is strong academically, but i couldn’t tell you exactly how they stack up against W&M and Wes.
I believe it is fairly safe to say that if you work hard and show up to classes, you will get an excellent education at any of them.
You should read everything you can find about the schools you like best and visit them if you can. Decide based on fit and cost.

34.<<<millie210>>>
If you can possibly manage it, please visit the schools. The exact same atmosphere and culture that one person hates will be the one another person loves. I have no real knowledge of W&M, so I won’t speak about it. I graduated from Wesleyan a long time ago, but its reputation was similar to what it is now. My politics are liberal for the US, but very middle of the road at Wes. I’m not artsy. My clothing style ran much more preppy than hippie. I LOVED Wesleyan. I loved the huge range of people and their interests, the independence the school granted to its students, the sheer number and variety of things to do on campus and, of course, the education I received. I met plenty of people more or less like me in background and level of artsy/political radical attitude, which was great, because there’s a comfort level to that for me. I met plenty of people who were very different from me, which was great because it was interesting. I made friends with people in both categories.
Wesleyan has very little in the way of distribution requirements. If W&M has significantly more requirements, think about whether or not that matters to you.
I don’t know whether or not you’d like Wesleyan, but nothing you’ve said about yourself makes me want to steer you away.
Oh, here’s probably a decent litmus test. Based on how you’ve described yourself, I’m assuming you’re not a gender fluid, vegan film major with multiple piercings. Does going to school with people whose level of, umm, ok, let’s go with funkiness, ranges from you to the gender fluid vegan (and includes everything in between) sound fun and interesting or just too weird and discomfiting? If you said fun and interesting, keep looking into Wesleyan.  If you went with too weird, you might be happier someplace more conventional.

35.<<<circuitrider>>>
@jackwang0703 - I thought you visited Wes like a year ago?

36.<<<circuitrider>>>
Also, this might be a good time to visit the W&M board. From a current student:

[quote]
Stress is generally very high for everyone, so it comes down to how you manage it. Most don’t do overly well even in the highest level classes. But that also comes down to terrible management of time (class of 12 for our seminar - final class in a major - we started our thesis work like 6-7 days before the 35pg thesis was due and that was the most important, final class. Take of that what you will).
Class difficulty is a pain because many classes are hard purely because the professor wants them to be hard. The content will then, somehow, be painfully easy. I’ve had this several times and it’s pretty infuriating. Even moreso because professors will peddle some “oh my gosh your B- was the highest grade in the class!! Congrats!” We have this idiotic narrative that “people” know about the grading and adjust accordingly. Really though, no one cares that you got a 2.7(B-) from W&M they care that you got a 2.7. Shoots our students in the foot while professors high five themselves (and you) as if their grading is doing anything but ruining your graduate school prospects.
I have many problems with the way we grade/deal with that here, but it’s a moot point.

There’s an Amtrak station at the Williamsburg Transportation Center, which would be about a 10 minute walk from the W&M campus.
Here’s an Amtrak system map:
https://www.amtrak.com/ccurl/631/638/SystemMapMar2015.pdf
Here’s the location of the train station in Williamsburg:
https://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=am/am2Station/Station_Page&code=WBG
According to Amtrak schedules, from Williamsburg to Washington (Union Station) takes between 3 hours 39 minutes and 4 hours 3 minutes depending on departure day and time. Apparently there are only 2 train departures daily from Williamsburg (one in the morning and one in the late afternoon) and 2 or 3 daily in the other direction. So if you wanted to spend a Saturday visiting DC museums, you’d spend much of the morning on the train, a few hours sight-seeing, then much of the evening getting back on the train.
By car via I-95 usually would be faster (maybe as little as 2.5 hours, depending on traffic).

Okay. Time out. Let’s take a deep breath. @jackwang0703 - you’re a full-paying international which makes you a highly desirable candidate for many public as well as private colleges. What other schools are you waiting to hear from?

40.<<<jackwang0703>>>
Oh there’s nothing left. That was just an update on my portal.

41.<<<jackwang0703>>>
I just wanna know the quality of this program

42.<<<circuitrider>>>
Is there a reason you eliminated Brandeis initially?

43.<<<tk21769>>>
For general liberal arts, Wesleyan probably has the best national reputation. If you were one of my kids, it’s the one I’d recommend. That’s just because I like LACs and it’s one of the best in that category, and because I prefer New England to the South. However, I doubt anyone can point to good evidence that its economics department (for example) is clearly better than the one at Brandeis or W&M. Film studies and ethnomusicology seem to be the only Wesleyan programs that are clearly better than anything ~30 other LACs also offer.
If you want to major in business as an undergrad, Richmond is the one clear choice. If you like the idea of a 5 year BA/MA (or MBA?) program, the Brandeis program looks good. It may not be better than a BA in economics plus an MBA, but would be faster, less expensive, and seems to be well-respected in its niche:
https://www.brandeis.edu/global/admissions/rankings.html
In my opinion, if you’re not too sure what you want, then W&M may be your best choice. For a full-paying international student it would be several thousand dollars per year cheaper than any of the others. It is a little larger than the others. It probably is better-known nationally and internationally than Wesleyan or Brandeis (and is definitely better known than URichmond even in the DC area). If your Auntie in Shanghai has never heard of it, then all you have to say is, “Second oldest American college after Harvard. Thomas Jefferson went there”. End of story.

44.<<<circuitrider>>>
^I agree with @tk21769 . You’re kind of reaping the rewards of the “street light effect” someone once described your college tour last year. Just about the only thing your choices have in common is that they are located near Amtrak stations. This makes it difficult to compare apples to apples since they are all prestigious in highly specific ways. Let Auntie know that the “college” part of W&M’s moniker does not mean it’s an American high school, but, rather a legitimate institution of higher learning and you should be all set. 

45.<<<prezbucky>>>
OK, in simple terms:
Go to Wes if you want an artsy/liberal-leaning environment and plenty of funk and/or if you want to major in one of the Humanities.
Go to W&M if you want to be close to DC, if you want a relatively less liberal vibe (than Wes and maybe Brandeis), and/or if you want to save a little bit of money (confirm cost…).
Go to URichmond if you want a slightly less liberal, more pre-professional LAC experience (than Wesleyan) and/or if you want to major in Business
Go to Brandeis if you want to be in the Boston area and/or if you want a combined BA/MA (or BA/MBA)

I think we’ve established that getting to DC from Williamsburg would be a pain without a car. Wesleyan actually has a straighter shot to New York City by Amtrak or car. But, I agree with the rest of your analysis.

47.<<<prezbucky>>>
Sorry about that! So OP, don’t go to W&M for the benefit of being close to DC, because it isn’t really close in practice. Another reason would be if you liked the colonial architecture/culture/vibe of the area.

48.<<<jackwang0703>>>
A friend of mine said that he would place W&M as the last option because it is public. He said among these schools, private ones are better than public for sure. Do you guys think that’s true?
Btw he is a senior too and got accepted by Duke, CMU, UVA, Middlebury, Bowdoin, Colby, WUSTL, etc.

49.<<<jackwang0703>>>
Wes might still be in the lead. I just consulted a friend who works for one of the big 4 accounting agencies in NYC. She’s also from Shanghai and went to Dickinson College. She told me the dual degree thing doesn’t really help. Only MBA, MD, JD and degrees like those are appealing.

50.<<<admissionsrep93>>>
I know I keep advocating for Richmond and W&M but in all honesty, everyone else is right in the sense that it is very “funky” and socially just/aware. Not to say that you aren’t, but as far as AP transfers and logistics go, W&M and Richmond are very accommodating while Wesleyan isn’t and you (sorry if I don’t sense correctly) don’t seem like the type to be very socially active as your #1 priority as Wesleyan students tend to be. Their classes are nowhere near professional in the area of buisness and their studies are VERY liberal. I heard of a trump supporter who wasn’t allowed to go to his classes because kids were rioting so much. While this is social justice, it is intense. I understand the rankings standpoint but Wesleyan is absoltely tied with W&M and possibly they are both a bit ahead of Richmond but if you want a traditional proper LAC you would choose Richmond or even W&M.

51.<<<momoftwins2017>>>
I second the opinion that for business in particular Richmond has both amazing internship opportunities, and placement outcomes.  For a mid-atlantic school it has a very strong network of alumni in the metro NY region.  One of my daughters is attending and loves it.  Definitely a lot of very bright students there who are landing incredible opportunities after graduation.

52.<<<SedgwickSt>>>
W&M has an admissions rate nearly twice that of Wes. In terms of selectivity and overall reputation I’d give Wes the strong edge. But both are obviously good schools.

What could be the potential benefits of Wes’s open curriculum?

55.<<<circuitrider>>>
Open curriculums, in general, make it much easier complete your major early, to take a semester off, and to even graduate early, if you so choose , since you’re not caught up with trying to take courses you don’t really need to take. They enable you to specialize in one subject, if you discover something that really grabs you. One thing you have to watch out for at Wesleyan is that you still need to fulfill the distribution requirements, if you plan on graduating with Honors.

56.<<<jackwang0703>>>
I was browsing through Wes’s website and came up with several questions.
http://www.wesleyan.edu/careercenter/career-outcomes.html

71% of class of 2016 were employed after graduation, and only 13% continued education. Does that somewhat indicate Wes might be a bit pre-professional? Or does it just show that a Wes degree is pretty appealing among employers? 
The chart by industry shows that Tech/Engineering/Sciences 15%, Education 13%, Media&Communications 13%, Financial Services 12%, Leisure/Arts&Entertainment 11%, Consulting 10%. It looks like Wes graduates are pretty evenly spread out in all major careers. Is this a good sign?
Does Wes have a strong study abroad program?

In response to post #47-- no. Top public colleges like William and Mary, and Berkeley, and Michigan, etc. are as good as top private colleges.
Wesleyan is not overly preprofessional at all. Intellectual interests and conversations seem to abound there.
Both colleges are excellent.  I think many previous posters pointed to the biggest differences:
William and Mary: a larger number of students and a more traditional college experience, with fraternities and southern charm. Gorgeous town. A majority of students from Virginia, but the rest from all over the world.
Wesleyan:  a small liberal arts college with small classes and a really personal experience; you will know your professors and classmates well. Delightfully quirky, outside-the-box students mix with a range of students, including everything from athletes to artists-- with some artists going on to do amazing things in film, TV, theater, etc. Close enough to New York City for a day trip on a weekend day. Students from a full range of states and countries all over the world.
How do you feel about a liberal atmosphere (not intolerant as one poster implied, but definitely an experimental type of place) with a great sense of community and small intimate classes, versus a larger-- though still not overly large-- school with a much more traditional feel and a mix of class sizes? That is your choice.

@TheGreyKing Thank you for your insight!
I think I’m more pro-Wes now because I’ve always wanted a sense of close knit community and close interactions with professors in small classes. It’s open curriculum also kinda attracts me since I don’t really know what I wanna major in yet. And the option to live in a single room as a freshman sounds really appealing as well.
I’m going to have a serious talk with my parents this weekend via video.

59.<<<IzzoOne>>>
I think W&M is pretty close knit as well, with lots of interaction with professors.  I think overall selectivity is similar.  Wesleyan may have lower admission rate, but a quick look shows W&M with higher GPA and percentage in the top 10% of high school class.
I think these schools would probably give you a different feeling if you could visit, which would help you decide.  Did you visit?  Are you in the U.S.?

I went to a college with core requirements and my son is at Wes…and I had the same question. I thought the admissions team nailed the response to this question by saying that the biggest advantage of their approach is that every student in every class is there because they want to be there…not because they’re checking some box. I immediately thought about the wasted semesters in language and math classes that I hated but had to tale…but didn’t take that seriously.  What a wasted opportunity that could have been spent exploring other disciplines.

61.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@IzzoOne I have visited Wesleyan with my parents but now I’m in the states by myself. I don’t think its very likely for me to visit W&M within the next month, but I’m pretty sure I will like their campus. Wesleyan’s campus is not amazing but it’s still acceptable. And the facilities are pretty good.
Wesleyan has a higher yield rate, which some people say is more significant than acceptance rate. W&M’s undergrad is at least twice as big but only received 2352 more applications. Does that suggest Wes might be more popular? And 65% of the students at W&M are from Virginia, while Wes is more diverse both domestically and internationally.

62.<<<wisteria100>>>
While William &Mary is bigger and public, it does have the feel of a smaller school and is community focused. Wes may be more diverse ethnically and with geography, but it won’t be diverse in types of thinking. ie; it is loudly liberal, left leaning, and yes funky. You may not find your people, if that doesn’t describe you.
@prezbucky  - I love how you described the schools as people!  Great way on contrasting schools

63.<<<jackwang0703>>>
I really appreciate the fact that I can choose to live in a single room as a freshman at Wes.
Anybody know if I can do that at W&M? And how are the dorms at each school?

No, Reed and W&L are very different, but I wouldn’t use them as proxies for Wes and W&M because I consider Reed and W&M closer to each other than either are to W&L and Wes, and those last two are polar opposites.
[/quote]

I graduated from Reed and have friends who went to Wesleyan. Reed is much, much closer to Wesleyan than it is to W&M or W&L. It’s in fact the ‘funkiest’ school on the list.

65.<<<jackwang0703>>>
I’m actually thinking about visiting W&M now. Does anybody know how to get there? (What airport and how to get to campus afterwards)

Sounds a lot like what happened in Sweden last month.

67.<<<jackwang0703>>>
April 8th is W&M’s admitted students day. My spring break just started today and it ends on the 9th.

68.<<<IzzoOne>>>
Nearest airport is Newport News/Williamsburg Airport which is probably about 20 miles away.  Richmond isn’t too far either.  If you are on the East Coast corridor, there is an Amtrak station in Williamsburg within walking distance of campus.
I’m sure W&M will provide information on transportation and lodging options.
Good luck.  You have good options.

Yeah, I think Wesleyan is pretty funky, but you’re right: Reed is funkier.
Why Reed is funkier than Wesleyan:
(1) Wesleyan has NCAA sports. Including football.
(2) Wesleyan encourages students to compete for grades. They reward the highest GPAs with “Latin honors”.
(3) Wesleyan cares about its USN&WR ranking. They voluntarily provide USN&WR with the data that they request.
Let’s face it: Wesleyan is no different than Texas A&M in these regards. Reed is the funkier alternative.

I just talked to a Chinese student at W&M. She told me that W&M is actually pretty liberal too, just not in a radical way like Wes. Students go to great grad schools. Classes are hard but a lot of Chinese students still get 4.0s. Classes in general are bigger than Wes. It’s easy to get to know your professors. First year residence is randomly selected and is pretty bad, but upper class have king/queen sized beds and can choose rooms. Williamsburg actually offers everything more conveniently than Middletown. There’s also an outlet thirty mins away. The thing that she loves the most is that everybody cares about each other like a community.

71.<<<millie210>>>
Wesleyan hasn’t had Latin honors for decades.
@jackwang0703 I think you may be missing a bit of the point of the suggestions that you visit, if possible. Sure, look around, see if you like the buildings and the general look of the campus. But what you should really be focused on is the people. Do you like the students you meet? Do they look happy? Engaged? Are they interesting? What are they talking about? Do you want to spend four years with these people?

OK, fair enough. Substitute “Dean’s List” for “Latin Honors” in Point 2 in my previous post.

This is actually pretty similar to what Wes graduates share, even quite a few of the employers are the same.

74.<<<prezbucky>>>
You could visit W&M and Richmond on the same relatively short trip. And you could visit Wes and Brandeis on another trip. (so, two total trips to visit these schools).
Or you could take a week or so and visit them all. You could fly into Boston and start at Brandeis, then head to Wes, then head down to Virginia for W&M and then Richmond. You could fly home from D.C. (or start in DC and fly home from Boston…)

And, yeah, I agree with what others have said; it’s crazy for OP to have come all this way and wind up buying a pig in a poke.* Definitely visit W&M. I think it will seal the deal for you and you can sleep better at night. 
*Quaint American (probably archaic) idiom meaning, to purchase something without seeing it.

76.<<<SedgwickSt>>>
OP…your college experience is going to be impacted far more by the community of students that you’ll be a part of then the proximity of outlets or size of dorm beds. As PP have suggested, it really is important to interact with current students and I’d be wary of relying too much on one-off data points. I’m admittedly biased towards Wes but I would vastly prefer to be in Middletown with easy access to NY and Boston than spend four years in Williamsburg. I also wouldn’t characterize the Wes student body as being radical…there is a a segment that is radical, as there is at just about every LAC, but overall the student body is diverse with a strong liberal bias.

What do these stats indicate? Is it a positive sign?

78.<<<circuitrider>>>
By any measure Wesleyan is a hot school right now.

79.<<<jackwang0703>>>
I think they intentionally reduced the number of admitted students this year by about 150-200.

Hi there, my daughter goes to W&M, and toured Wesleyan.
I’m surprised no one has mentioned that Wesleyan has an open curriculum with no distribution requirements, whereas William and Mary requires you to take classes in humanities, social studies, science, and language to graduate. My daughter felt that W&M had more rigor, and that you could slack off at Wes if you wanted to. But for some students, the open curriculum at Wesleyan makes it easier to specialize in their area of study. Wesleyan is the more selective school to get into with a 17% admit rate.
Wesleyan is attracting more artsy kids because of the success of Lin Manuel Miranda’s Hamilton. W&M’s Mason school of business is climbing the rankings and is competitive to get into (you can apply in the spring of your sophomore year).
I would not describe W&M as conservative, just that Wesleyan is much more liberal with a bigger arts scene. I would describe U Richmond as the more preppy place.
To get to Williamsburg, fly into Reagan Washington DCA, then take the metro Blue Line to King Street, Alexandria Amtrak Station. Take Amtrak to Williamsburg, VA.  You can also try flying into Richmond and taking Amtrak from there (you’ll need to take an Uber or taxi to Richmond train station), but it is usually cheaper to fly to Washington DC.
PS Since you are from Shanghai, you will have no problem with Williamsburg summers. But maybe you would like to experience a typical New England winter?

81.<<<jackwang0703>>>
@VAOptimist I’ve actually asked a question about their open curriculum before. Look at #54
Thank you for your insight! Why did your daughter choose W&M if you don’t mind sharing?

82.<<<VAOptimist>>>
@jackwang0703, my daughter was admitted to Wellesley, Oberlin, BU, Smith and UVA, but chose to attend W&M, largely for financial reasons. We are instate, so tuition was significantly lower for all except UVA.
She feels that W&M has the mix of small classes with good interaction with professors, nice, intellectual kids, and the sense of community that she was seeking. The downside is that it is not near a major city. W&M makes it easy to study abroad so a lot of students take advantage of that to go to an interesting destination their junior year. W&M also offers a semester in Washington, DC.
The campus is beautiful and not too spread out to get around easily. And your friend is correct - you will have a double your freshman year and possibly your sophomore and junior years too. Roommates are part of the experience for most US college students.
I really hope that you get a chance to visit.

83.<<<jackwang0703>>>
I just talked to another Wesleyan 2018 who started the social media platform in China. He just told me some shocking stats from this year’s admission of Chinese students.
There’s over 1000 students applied overall and over 100 applied ED. 22 got accepted under ED and less than 30 under RD. That makes the overall Chinese acceptance rate about 4% and RD about 3%… That’s insane. I didn’t realize I’m that lucky to get an acceptance. Last year only 900 Chinese applied but they accepted over 70. Plus he said many students who got into Penn, Pomona, Bowdoin or Wellesley got rejected or waitlisted by Wes.
What a crazy year! Beyond blessed.
