I was accepted both early action and early decision to NYU and U of M. I wasn't stuck with NYU because of being placed into a different school than I applied to. Because of instate and being practical about having money for grad school later on I have enrolled to U of M- Ann Arbor in LSA to eventually major in Biochemistry. Is there any advice that can get me out of the dumps about not doing to my top choice school of NYU next fall?

2.<<<ForeverAlone>>>
NYU seriously isnt better, it is at best equal. If you wanted to go to Standford or Columbia instead, then I could underrstand

3.<<<Alexandre>>>
Even Columbia is not better in the sciences and premed tracks. NYU does not come close to Michigan. Spending $40k a year more to attend NYU makes no sense whatsoever. Other than Stern, NYU is simply not in the same league as Michigan.

4.<<<Bouncer>>>
You have to rescind your acceptance from Michigan because you did ED on NYU.

5.<<<qwertyzxc>>>
It's absolutely false that NYU is not in the same league as Michigan. It is impossible to make broad generalizations like that. If anything NYU gets more competitive candidates b/c its a private school that doesn't lower its standards for instate students. Yes Michigan is a great school but saying that NYU is not in the same league is just utterly false. You get a lot of opportunities at NYU (whether in Stern or not) simply by being located in the most happening city in the world. Advantage from location is a lot more important than most people realize it to be. NYU rose from virtually a no-name commuter school just only 20/30 years ago to the amazing &amp; top-ranked school that it is today, and it is still on the rise.

Internationally NYU is one of the most recognized universities because its situated in NYC and its location adds to its academic value.

6.<<<ForeverAlone>>>
I've already proven in another thread that the admission statistics are very similar. While respected, NYU will always in Columbia's shadow due to their proximity. The fact that NYU needs to be in NYC to have its students and academics be in the same tier as Michigan just proves how NYU itself that it would be much less if it were located 5 hours further away in upstate New York.

7.<<<manduhhh20>>>
I wasn't tied to going to NYU due to being placed in the engineering school and not general studies like I had applied to.

Yes.

Here are some rankings that help explain further, using the national rankings. Both schools appear in different positions in their private/ public school listings, respectively ( UM is #4 public, and I am unsure of NYU's rank on the list of schools in that cohort)


<url>http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/new-york-university-2785</url>

<url>http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-michigan-ann-arbor-9092</url>

I don't suggest relying on just one source of rankings, but in the national university picture, the above links paint a very good picture of what both schools have to offer, and what the student body is like.

9.<<<Alexandre>>>
qwertyzxc, you are entitled to your opinion, but the facts do not bear this out. Michigan is stronger than NYU, particularly in the sciences... Naturally, NYU has its strengths. Stern is one of the top 5 undergraduate business programs in the nation and is certainly on par with Ross. NYU's film school is the best in the nation. NYU is also stellar in the humanities and very strong in the Social Sciences. But Michigan's science programs are all ranked much higher than NYU. It is not even close:

Biology:
Michigan #20 (tied with the likes of Columbia and UPenn)
NYU #56

Chemistry:
Michigan #16 (tied with Chicago, Princeton, UPenn and Yale)
NYU is not ranked in the top 50

Physics:
Michigan #11 (tied with Columbia and Yale)
NYU #40

Engineering:
Michigan #7
NYU (NYU Poly) not ranked among the top 50

Medicine:
Michigan #8 (tied with Chicago, Columbia, Duke and Yale)
NYU #21

Also, in terms in placement into top Medical Schools, Michigan edges out NYU by a ratio of better than 3:1:

JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL SCHOOL
Michigan alums currently enrolled 13
Princeton 12

Overall, Michigan's reputation is also stronger than NYU's. Regardless of the source, Michigan will generally have a stronger reputational score. Most notably, the US News Peer Assessment score assigns Michigan a rating of 4.5 (tied with the likes of Brown, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Northwestern and UPenn). NYU's Peer Assessment score is 3.8, which is significantly lower. Even international rankings like the Times, ARWU and QS all rank Michigan well ahead of NYU. Most of the international attention NYU gets is thanks to its location. Naturally, most international students dream of living in California or NYC.

Michigan's endowment stands at $8.4 billion (not including the $300 million is annual state appropriations), compared to NYU's $2.9 billion. Considering the fact that both schools have approximately 40,000 students, Michigan is in considerably better financial shape than NYU.

I personally do not think selectivity is an important criteria in determining the quality of a university, but even if it were, Michigan and NYU are roughly the same (similar class profiles when it comes to class rankings, GPA, standardized test scores etc...).

Like I said, for a Michigan resident, it is not worth choosing NYU over Michigan when it would cost $40k more on an annual basis. It is simply not justifiable.

10.<<<Alexandre>>>
"You have to rescind your acceptance from Michigan because you did ED on NYU."

Not in this case Bouncer. The OP has explained that he was rejected by the specific NYU college he applied to ED. As such, he is not bound to the alternate college at NYU that admitted him.

It's not even just rankings.
A comparison of their incoming class average GPA, Test scores, acceptance rate, yield rate, 4 and 6 year graduation rates, and other factors will be very similar.

Really futile to deny being in the same tier

12.<<<bclintonk>>>
[quote]<a rel="nofollow" href="/profile/ForeverAlone">ForeverAlone</a> wrote:[/quote]

No question Michigan and NYU draw similarly credentialed students: their middle 50% ACT scores are identical (28-32), NYU has a very slight edge in middle 50% SAT CR scores (+10 points) while Michigan has a slightly larger edge in middle 50% SAT M scores (+20 points). There's a bigger difference in HS GPAs: Michigan has an average of 3.8 with a middle 50% of 3.7-3.9, while NYU has an average of 3.6 with a middle 50% of 3.4-3.8. That's a non-trivial difference, but it may be partly explained by the fact that Michigan has always placed greater weight on HS GPA than on standardized test scores. Overall, though, I'd say Michigan is getting a somewhat stronger entering class.

Graduation rates are not that close. NYU has a 6-year graduation rate of 86%; Michigan's is 91%. This is a non-trivial difference. Michigan's graduation rate is similar to that of Chicago (92%), Caltech (92%), Vanderbilt (92%), Rice (92%), UCLA (92%),Tufts (92%), UC Berkeley (91%), USC (90%), and Brandeis (90%). In comparison, NYU's 6-year graduation rate is similar to that of Penn State (86%), UCSD (86%), UC Davis (85%), U Rochester (85%), and Florida (85%). Whether or not that counts as a different "tier," there's no question Michigan keeps company with a better class of schools on that metric.

On faculty strength it's not at all close. Stern and Ross are both top-of-the-line business programs. Michigan blows NYU out of the water in engineering. As Alexandre has pointed out, NYU is quite weak across the board in basic sciences, while Michigan is top 20 or top 25 in most. In the humanities, NYU can match or exceed Michigan in philosophy and art history; beyond that, I'd be hard pressed to name a single field where NYU is Michigan's equal. And in the social sciences Michigan dominates with top 5 or top 10 programs in every major discipline, while NYU is an also-ran in many (except in economics where they're pretty close, and both very good). Pound for pound, I'd take Michigan's faculty over NYU's any day of the week.

And Michigan's faculty is cheaper. A lot of what props up NYU in the US News rankings is that they compensate their faculty handsomely, which they need to do given their pricey location--the average full professor at NYU makes about $40K per year more than the average full professor at Michigan, even though the Michigan professor probably lives as well or better in Ann Arbor on that lower salary due to differences in the cost of living. Those cost-of-living factors don't seem to figure into the US News equation, so high-cost schools in high-cost locations tend to be rewarded in the rankings for their high costs.

13.<<<pHyRe7>>>
Also, with the vast difference in cost, i'm sure you can say "you didn't give enough aid" and be let off from the ED and go to Umich no problems.

IMO, cost is crucial with two similar universities. In this case, UMich is probably better in most areas (except those mentioned above like film etc. ) so it's really a no brainer

14.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"US News Peer Assessment score assigns Michigan a rating of 4.5 (tied with the likes of Brown, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Northwestern and UPenn). NYU's Peer Assessment score is 3.8, which is significantly lower."

Academicians know who are peers of Michigan and who are not. Time and again too many here on CC do not give Michigan its due when it comes to academics.

15.<<<KronOmega>>>
Just to correct one point that bclintonk made, the middle 50% of unweighted GPA's at Michigan is 3.7-4.0 not 3.7-3.9. The average unweighted matriculated freshman GPA at Michigan is 3.83. The average unweighted GPA at NYU is a 3.61. As far as GPA's go, that's a monstrous difference.

The point is- right now, at this moment in time, the numbers show the UM is ahead of NYU.

When NYU gets done buying Manhattan and accomplishes all the goals it may have, then it will be a different discussion.

However, the OP will be going to school in the year 2014, not the unspecified future. ;)

18.<<<Decorative22>>>
Oh my goodness!

This is two threads where you are trying to start fights over nothing. You should probably try and figure out why you are so angry and posting as such to strangers on an Internet board for a community supportive of your chosen school.

No one is "trashing" NYU. The OP was disappointed by not being able to go to NYU ( you did catch that, right? ), so those of us that are posting positively are using the current facts to bolster his spirits.

Relax. UM just beat beat MSU. It's a nice day. ;)

19.<<<Archer1415>>>
East Village kid here:

Despite Michigan's public schools being "in a shambles", their students are still outpacing NYU students according to standardized test scores despite the NYU constituency being from "a pretty affluent profile", like the Bronx and Staten Island. NYU will easily surpass Michigan Ann Arbor in 3 years, since, apparently, blueblood is now Nostradamus.

As for this statement: "NYU students have on average lower GPAs than Michigan since they have a greater proportion of students who attended a selective private high school or boarding school where the competition is stiffer than the public schools of the state of Michigan." Best of luck proving that.

The CDS standardized scores speak for themselves. If this is the best you can do, then it must be the NYU.

20.<<<Alexandre>>>
"NYU has a better law school and MBA program than Michigan."

I am not sure that is the case. NYU and Michigan Law and Business programs are usually ranked within 3 spots of each other and have similar ratings according to scholars and recruiters.

"Neither school is worth going into debt over."

I agree with that statement. In fact, I do not believe any university is worth going into debt for, which is one of the main reason why most posters here have recommended Michigan in the first place.

At any rate, here's one way of looking at it:

Michigan peers according to ennisthemenace: NYU

NYU peers for undergraduate education according to the academic world: Boston College, Brandeis, College of William and Mary, Colorado-Boulder, Emory, Indiana University-Bloomington, Maryland-College Park, Minnesota-Twin Cities, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue, Rice, Texas-Austin, Tufts, UC-Davis, UC-Irvine, UC-San Diego, University of Florida, UIUC, USC

Michigan peers for undergraduate education according to the academic world: Cal, Brown, Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, Penn and UVa.

There is clearly a disconnect between ennisthemenace and the mass of the intellectual elite. One can choose to follow ennisthemenace...or the whole of the academic world. I wonder which is better?

21.<<<SoccerWolfP>>>
As someone who is a student at Michigan and has a brother attending NYU, as well as an older sister who attended NYU, I can say that the two schools are relatively equal academic-wise. The main difference that it comes down to is:

-Sports or no sports?
-Campus College Town or City?

Seriously, it just comes down to what type of college experience you want. Both are huge schools, have a lot of alums, and a great reputation.

22.<<<manduhhh20>>>
This has definitely helped. Made things come to light that I would've never known.

23.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"There is clearly a disconnect between ennisthemenace and the mass of the intellectual elite."

" Michigan has slipped a bit in the rankings, has a public school system and state that feeds it in shambles, and seems dedicated to athletics."

The state of Michigan is not in a "shambles." It is running a budget surplus and is in better shape financially than many other states. Enough with the histrionics already!

" Michigan has slipped a bit in the rankings, has a public school system and state that feeds it in shambles, and seems dedicated to athletics."

You mean the USNWR rankings of top private universities with a few token elite publics thrown in to give it any semblence of credibitily? Michigan has not slipped one iota when it comes to the only numbers that cannot be easily manipulated to fit the USNWR formula to gain rankings. That is of course, the peer assessment scores. When the PA score of NYU is anywhere near Michigan's, then we can have a discussion over which school is "better" academically.

26.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Instate rates for Michigan over full pay at NYU is really a no brainer. Michigan all the way!

27.<<<GoBlue81>>>
To the OP: I don't understand how NYU can place you in the engineering school when you applied ED for General Studies. Did you indicate that you are also interested in engineering?

28.<<<KronOmega>>>
Oh come on now bluebound. You are being ridiculous.

The low GPA's for incoming NYU students is a perfectly valid thing to bring up when discussing selectivity. Even if you chose to compare on like terms by looking only at other private entities and using class rank to abstract away the GPA's, NYU has just over 60% of their students in the top 10% of their class, wheras most other Michigan-esque private universities with similar selectivity have 85%+ of their students in the top 10%. NYU is simply not as selective as Michigan. They just have a strong emphasis towards test scores which most other universities, including Michigan, do not.

Although NYU is ranked only 4 places below Michigan in the USNWR rankings, you need to realize that they are only one agency. Not a single well respected ratings firm has NYU ahead of Michigan, and of the ones I know, NYU is anywhere up to 67 places behind U-M.

Again, in terms of finances, it's not even a competition. Michigan has an endowment in excess of $9 Billion, NYU's is less than $3 Billion. Michigan receives on average over $300 Million per year from the state in allocations and outlay funds, NYU receives $0 because it's a private entity. Michigan Athletics can make anywhere up to $40 Million in profit in a year, most of which goes towards non-athletic funds, where NYU's athletics is in a state of perpetual financial loss. Even if you look at the credit ratings of the two schools, Michigan has the highest possible rating, where NYU is below most of its peers with an AA-minus and billions of dollars of debt. This is all despite the fact that NYU has MORE students to manage with their money than Michigan.

The fact of the matter is that NYU cares much more about it's image as a top school than it does actually being one. It's why NYU's admission philosophy gives ridiculous emphasis to test scores, because they know class rank &amp; GPA's aren't considered in rankings. It's why NYU outright fabricated their student/faculty ratio that was reported to external agencies, because they saw other universities getting away with it, and they knew it would improve their national perception. It's why NYU has one of the largest advertising and marketing departments in the country, when most other universities don't even have one.

I apologize that I had to write so much, but what you are saying is just so far beyond reasonable that I felt compelled to reply.

29.<<<i012575>>>
Thanks for this list @ennisthemenace. Yes, the Ivies do shine out as expected in terms of their quality of student intake. Some other notables I caught at first glance:

The "pretenders", ie. student class worse than otherwise recognized - BC (5) , Wake Forest (5), Cooper Union (1), JHU (28), Bowdoin (3), Georgetown (23), UCLA (16), CWilliamMary (8),

The "under-rated" - GTECH (33), UVA (36), UNC (37), Pitt (21), USC (53), Harvey MC (16), Texan A&amp;M (24), Northeastern (29), Baylor (20)

@ennisthemenace

It's important to realize that Michigan is an ACT state and many of the university's highest represented states outside of Michigan are also ACT states. The National Merit Scholarship is a SAT program. It seems like a very reasonable possibility to me that there are many many students at Michigan who have just never even taken the SAT, but are easily National Merit material.

If you instead look at nationally recognized scholarships outside of the high school level, it is a much better indicator of the academic level of the students.

For example, if you look at the Fulbright scholarships in 2012/2013 and list it by top producing institutions you get something like this:

UniversityofMichigan:40
HarvardUniversity: 31
BrownUniversity:29
UniversityofChicago:24
...
New York University: 8

Rhodes isn't a good indicator unfortunately because of their weird district based process, but if you look at the Cambridge's Gates Scholarship, you will see similar numbers with Michigan doing extremely well. President Coleman was actually one of only two university presidents invited to the board of trustees in part because of the outstanding relationship developed over the years between the institution and the scholarship.

The fact of the matter is that Michigan's student body as a whole is outstandingly successful post graduation. Michigan has graduated the founder of Google, the CEO of Twitter, the president of the United States, the inventor of the iPod, dozens of billionaires, and many other wildly successful people.

32.<<<manduhhh20>>>

@bluebound18 "To a family with a household income north of $500k, "value shopping" colleges for their kids isn't really a thing."

Oh please... when did 500k gross, especially for a family, become anything even close to an income level where tuition cost doesn't matter? Almost all of the people above me (who actually have to think about sending kids to school) where I used to work gross way more than 500k and tuitions CERTAINLY mattered to them. I would know since not a week goes by without someone whining about their kids' tuition. (Can't form an opinion with where I work now since it's a younger crowd and the only people sending their kids to college are partners who are worth 8-9 digits, but I still hear people complaining about the 30k/year private school cost)

500k gross comes out to about 350 net, give or take, depending on state tax. Assuming one lives in a home that is commensurate to the income level (in Dallas that would be edges of Highland Park or the cheaper parts of Preston Hollow), you'd have about 250k left after all the housing related cost. It's really not as much as the headline number would indicate, especially if you have more than one kid to send to school.

34.<<<Decorative22>>>
When a private school has a clear advantage over a public, then it makes sense to have a conversation.

When the private school does not, then it is not a useful exercise. Cost alone is not useful as an indicator of value, nor does it prove someone is smarter by simply paying more.

In this situation, the OP should be feeling confident and hopefully positive about the opportunity ahead at UM.

Congratulations again, Manduhh. I hope your college career is extremely satisfying and gives you a great start!

The chance that TC will be one is pretty damn low. It's more important how the average person does out of these two universities than how the very best ever have done.

To that end, I don't know if there's much of a difference between the two. At least in something like Biochem. However, being instate, it's clear to me that Michigan is the right choice. The difference is between an NYU degree and a Michigan degree + a small house.

It's curious that NYU would stick you 'randomly' in a school you have shown no interest in ... a school that's arguably the weakest (and one they hope to build up).

This reminds me of years ago, several international students were admitted ED to NYU, not in the schools of their choices, but placed in the program First Year at Florence. You have to wonder...

41.<<<Finnlet>>>

You will have an amazing time at Michigan. There is a reason that their alumni are so devoted. You will have the best of everything - great educational opportunities with the added bonus of a real college experience. Don't listen to some of the people on here; I really don't understand some of the negativity and the ridiculous hair-splitting. I don't know if some of these people live in the real world, because they have a really narrow view of the world. Be excited - there are a lot of people who would love the opportunity to go to Michigan! Look at some of the other threads on CC - you will see plenty of people dying to know if they are going to get in. All good things ahead for you!

48.<<<Decorative22>>>
I am sure you saw this when accepted, but the M difference video? Works pretty well to get excited:

<url>http://youtu.be/yfOYIPWK1F8</url>

There are so many good things ahead of you. Ann Arbor in the fall? Amazing. You're going to meet all sorts of people. You're very likely about to meet the people that will be with you as you go forward in life. Some of my best friends on earth- I met freshman year.

You're going to meet amazing professors and other instructors that will challenge you. It's cool when you open a book in a class and realize, literally, that the prof standing before you wrote it, and it's the book that sets the standard for that subject. You're going to meet people who want to learn as much as you do. You're going to have great talks (and sometimes fights) with classmates. And you're going to learn so much.

You're going to walk across the Diag on a fall day, and carefully avoid that M, and just be amazed at all the activity.

Amazing speakers are going to visit campus- and you'll be able to go to Hill and hear them. Seriously- so many wonderful and interesting people, and you'll have them right there.

You're going to go to your first game at the Big House- and even if you hate football? You're going to love the chills you get when you see the band take the field, and when you raise that arm to say "hail".

I could go on and on- and I will if you want. But believe me when I tell you- you will be proud to be a Michigan Wolverine. I promise.

"Relatives at Stanford, Duke and Notre Dame tell me most students don't even care about athletics -- which is surprising."

Relatives at Duke and Notre Dame tell you that most students do not care about athletic? Your relatives are misinformed. Duke students stand in line by the thousands to get tickets to basketball games. Notre Dame fills a stadium of 80,000 to capacity for every game. Last year, more Irish fans attended Notre Dame games than Badger fans attended University of Wisconsin games or Gator fans attended University of Florida games. For a university with only 11,000 students (compared to 44,000 students at Wisconsin and Florida), that is quite an accomplishment. To say that "most" Duke or Notre Dame students do not care about athletics is very inaccurate.

Having a strong athletic culture is a positive quality. Universities would die to have what schools like Duke, Michigan, Notre Dame, OSU, Texas-Austin, UNC etc...have. Bragging about not having an athletic culture is foolish. Schools with strong athletic traditions offer something extra. There are thousands of students at those universities who care nothing for athletics, and nobody is forcing them to attend the games, support the teams or listen to the cheers. Those students would have the same experience attending a university with no athletic tradition. But for those who enjoy attending games and cheering for the team, those universities offer an experience like no other.

"But clearly he knows there is value is a private education, otherwise he wouldn't be devastated (tongue in cheek or otherwise)."

I am not sure how private universities differ from public universities like Michigan (or UVa). Michigan undergrads are among the wealthiest (last I checked, they had among the highest percentage of students coming from families with annual incomes over $200k) and most well-travelled, and I am comparing them to undergrads at schools like Cornell (my other alma matter) and Georgetown (my sister's and father's alma matter). Its endowments is among the largest (when including state appropriations, Michigan is almost 5 times wealthier than NYU). In fact, only a handful of universities are wealthier than Michigan. Even without including state appropriations, Michigan is one of the 20 wealthiest universities on a per capita basis. When you include state appropriations, it is one of the 10 wealthiest. The facilities at Michigan are among the best and costliest in the nation, and again, that is compared to Cornell.

52.<<<blprof>>>
Gee bluebound, here I though I was successful and happy when, after attending state colleges for both undergrad and law school, I married my law school sweetheart, moved to a wonderful town in upstate NY, became a college professor, and raised two amazing kids with my husband of now-21 years. Now I see that I did it all wrong. If only I had gone to a top-10 private school, I could have had it all . ..

Oh, wait ...

Bluebound, you need to get out of the wealthy enclave of Bloomfield Hills a little more and mix with the unwashed masses. It won't hurt, I promise. Your advice to the OP is neither helpful nor as accurate as you would like to think it is.

Most intellectuals? Another one of those "most students at Duke and Notre Dame do not even care about athletics" statements I see. Well, that is not my experience with intellectual types, including myself (yeah, I read history and literature for fun, enjoy the theater and count gastronomy and oenophilia among my passions. "Intellects" are like most people. Some care nothing for athletics while others froth at the mouth when watching their team play. The point bluebound, is that those who do not care for athletics can simply ignore them on campuses that have a rich athletic cultures. Just because a university has a strong athletics tradition does not inhibit the intellectual vibe on campus. And while some students and faculty may find athletics off-putting on campuses with a well defined athletic vibe (like Duke, Michigan or Notre Dame), there are also some students and faculty who wish there was more of an athletic tradition on campuses with weak athletic cultures (like Brown or MIT). There is no perfect scenario. However, one thing is clear, those who care nothing for athletics can live at a school like Michigan without having to bother with the athletics, while those who do care for athletics will unfortunately never be able to quench their appetite for athletics as a school that has no athletic tradition. Either way, I fail to see how this impacts the quality of education.

"FYI Harvard has the reserves to turn themselves into a football or basketball powerhouse. They choose not to."

It is not as easy as you think. Yale, with its $21 billion endowment (second only to Harvard), has been trying to improve its Engineering programs for over a decade, and it is not much closer to achieving that goal today than it was in the 1990s. Part of the equation is developing a reputation in the given area of improvement to attract the right personnel (whether it is faculty or coaches, students or athletes). Throwing money at the problem will obviously help, but it will not be enough on its own. It takes a long time to build up a brand, reputation and culture, and for this reason, change will come about slowly.

Just curious, does the GPA inflation at Ross (and other places like Harvard) hurt or help its students? Would students need higher gpas than usual to secure jobs and internships or does this gpa inflation just help them?

For bluebound18:

1) I'm not clear on the selection of your screen name since you seem to uniformly disparage Michigan?


2) "I guess you are right Alexandre that Michigan's smartest students are better than NYU's smartest students. However, the "thickness of intelligence" for UMich student body doesn't compare to the Ivy League schools who have more National Merit Scholars even though they have a quarter of Michigan's undergraduate population!"

Facts easily verified via wikipedia and via UM's web site:
a) More students take the ACT than the SAT;
b) the Ivy interquartile range is 30-34;
c) UM's common data set shows that 63% of the undergraduate population has an Ivy Leage ACT score above the Ivy League 25% or the lower bound of the interquartile range. With 28,000 students, that indicates that UM has 17,640 students with an Ivy League ACT score;
d) in consequence, UM has more kids on the Ann Arbor campus with Ivy League test scores than Harvard, Yale and Princeton combined.
e) the national Merit scholar thing is overdone because it is a tail even and you don't use tail events to characterize the thickness or centrality of the distribution.
f) as others have noted, while the Fulbright is also a tail event, Michigan wins that discussion over the last decade: more scholars than any other school;
g) Sloan fellows are also tail events, but UM does very very well in that regard;
h) the endowment is some evidence of student success, and here UM does very well;

"Not when 30-35% of UM students attended crappy Michigan public schools. Unless you think a 3.8 from Cass Tech or East Lansing is equivalent to a 3.8 at Dalton."

Yet somehow these same kids are also the kids that are serving up the Ivy League level ACT scores...see my other post in this regard: 17,640 kids with board scores at or above the Ivy League level for this test. Further, we know that GPA is a function of institution, but you seem to be suggesting that the UM adcom folks aren't aware of the nuances behind such GPAs. You also seem to be assuming that the GPA -- inherently subjective as a metric -- is a more worthy proxy than board scores which are nominally more objective.

"EDIT: few schools in the top 20 US News have a focus on athletics. In my experience, Michigan at #28 is probably the first school where so many students view it as a draw. Relatives at Stanford, Duke and Notre Dame tell me most students don't even care about athletics -- which is surprising."

I can't speak for the students, but it is interesting to note that Schlissel, the incoming President and former Brown provost, has noted that Brown, at one quarter or so the size of UM, has just as many student athletes on campus as UM. So UM's budget is a lot larger and they compete at a higher level, but Brown has roughly 4 times as many per capital athletes as UM. Stanford presents a similar picture.

Being an intellectual and enjoying sports are not mutually exclusive.

bluebound, one thing you will learn at Michigan is that saying "it is obvious that" or "everyone knows that" or "that is the way it is--period" won't make a statement true.

60.<<<Decorative22>>>
Germane to the topic of the thread and the OP- who is attending UM and not NYU, and asked for support in that- UM is the #4 ranked public university in the same survey you now quote in every post, and consistently ranked as a top university worldwide in other surveys. That's not exaggerated. :)

Also, when pretending to be a teenager, it would be best not to use words like "stoked". Because in 2014? Not particularly part of the current teen lingo.

"None of my remarks are disparaging."

You may not realize this, but saying that Michigan is not as good as any of the universities ranked above it in the USNWR is disparaging. People like me happen to believe that Michigan is one of best undergraduate universities in the US. That is why, as an OOS student, I chose it over other top universities, including several that are ranked higher in the USNWR. Knowing what I know today, I would still make that choice.

"I'm actually stoked to be headed to Ann Arbor."

Really? You could have fooled me.

"People like you all and the sports groupies are the only turnoffs, to be honest."

You should not be stoked about going to Michigan. You are bound to run into a lot of people who take pride in attending Michigan and/or "sport groupies". In fact, those types make up the majority of students at Michigan. You are likely to be miserable at Michigan if you cannot stand people who enjoy Michigan athletics or who actually think Michigan is a great university.

"UMich undergrad is a great in-state public school value. If we didn't live in Michigan, I would never pay oos tuition to go to such a huge public school, if provide higher ranked options."

Why let that get in the way? You were recommending that the in-state student who started this very thread go to NYU over Michigan, even if it costs more to attend. Why not follow your own advice and go to an out of state private?

"Everyone knows UMich undergrad is biggest safety for oos wealthy students that can't get into any of the higher ranked private schools they applied to (or Cal/UCLA in Cali cases)."

Last year, thousands of OOS students with excellent credentials were rejected by Michigan. Among them, I know of several who were admitted into Ivy League schools. For OOS Michigan is not a safety school. I am sure many approach Michigan as a safety, but many of them will be shocked when they receive that proverbial thin envelope in April. At this point in time, Michigan is a target for OOS students with 3.9+ unweighed GPA AND 2200+ SAT/33+ ACT scores. It is a reach for all other applicants. An OOS applicant with a 3.8 unweighed GPA and a 2100 on the SAT / 31 ACT should consider Michigan a reach.

"People, especially wealthy people willing to pay OOS for a state school, generally go to the highest ranked school they get into."

That is correct. But you are assuming that the USNWR is the only ranking people consider. Most parents do not rely entirely on one ranking. They look at several rankings and they ask around too. Outside of the US, the USNWR is not as commonly read as other international rankings. Most families also realize that when you have thousands of universities, schools within a few spots of each other could be equal. In some instances, the lower ranked school could be stronger. Many would believe that Stanford is better than Columbia or that MIT is better than Chicago. Most would agree that Brown and Cornell are better than WUSTL. etc...

Most people also take strength of departments into consideration. A school ranked #25 will be more appealing than a school ranked #15 if the student wishes to major in Engineering and #25 has a significantly stronger Engineering program than #15. Most wealthy people are highly educated, and educated people hold Michigan in high esteem...certainly on par with many schools ranked above it in the USNWR. According to a poll conducted in 2003, Michigan was rated higher than all but 7 universities (all but 4 universities among the most educated segment of the population). Many educated people know more about universities than the USNWR. With so many opinion polls ranking Michigan in or around the top 10 undergraduate universities (including ones conducted within academe), it is clear that many people do not agree with the USNWR ranking.

In other words, think long and hard before telling someone who chose to attend Michigan, and there are literally thousands who choose Michigan from a range of excellent universities, that it is barely a top 30 university. You may not think it "disparaging", but to her/him, it is.

Alexandre is right on the money.

@bluebound18. You may be young and talented. However, you have A LOT to learn about the world outside of high school. I'm not saying you are stupid, but you make a lot of ignorant comments.

"So I should get used to defending common knowledge that is denied by agenda driven people who want to make their #28 ranked (public) undergraduate college sound more spectacular than it is? Duly noted."

1) I'm not sure why "(public)" is in the above: Michigan is ranked #28 in a ranking which includes both public and private schools; and as to "undergraduate college"...there is an undergraduate division which comprises both schools and colleges; LS&amp;A is the CLA at Michigan, but there are other undergraduate entities to which the ranking applies;

2) as to the #28 ranking, USN&amp;WR has done away with strict cardinal rankings thus recognizing that the numerical differences suggest a spurious difference in quality; in fact there are roughly 13 to 14 ties in rankings above Michigan, it is probably much more accurate to say that the UM ranking is 15th or so when creating an ordinal ranking of cohorts which differ by fractions of points on the numerical side...if I rank 3 schools #3, I should rank the next school #4, not #6;

3) Michigan's ranking is non-convex to the actual metrics: a faculty which is ranked top 5 for prizes, citations, research; a student body which tests out above the 35th percentile as Ivy; a 7th ranked endowment; a physical plant which is 2nd to none for breadth, quality, cutting-edge equipment; a "AAA" bond rating; academic departments at the undergraduate level which rank in the top10 (40 such programs) where the bulk of the students are actually in departments in the top 5 in the country, and certainly no lower than 15th or so;

Because of this non-convexity given faculty, campus, students, the USN&amp;WR ranking is a bit of a joke. It is interesting to note that ALL of the GLOBAL rankings rank UM higher GLOBALLY than USN&amp;WR

Thanks for the help guys! But some more uplifting comments would be more beneficial!
