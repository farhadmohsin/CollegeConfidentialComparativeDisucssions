I was accepted into the honors program at the University of Michigan with a 10k scholarship and into MIT without a scholarship.

2.<<<hoedown>>>
I guess if you think Umich is a second rate university, you've already answered your question. Don't come.

U-M is different from MIT, and doesn't have all the same resources. But I don't think it's considered second-rate by anyone truly knowledgeable, even compared to MIT.

3.<<<tetrahedr0n>>>
Honors program at UM? I thought they didnt have an honors program for engineering, just for las?

4.<<<jarell14>>>
i agree w/hoedown. sounds like ur decision is made with:

Why should I choose University of Michigan over MIT? I wouldn't sacrifice a great education for some cash at a 2nd rate university (compared to MIT that is..)

r u trying to get someone to convince you to go to Umich?

5.<<<GoBlue81>>>
There is no honor program in engineering. So if you are in the Honor program at U-M, you applied and are admitted to LSA Honor. Are you still deciding whether you want to be in engineering? If so, you have something else to think about.

The two schools are quite different. So it depends on what kind of college experience you want. I chose Michigan over MIT 'cause I wanted to stay in the midwest and I wanted a liberal campus...but that was for grad school in ChE where there wasn't much difference at the time.

Academically, MIT engineering is stronger overall. In some areas, the Michigan programs are comparable - biomedical ('cause of the strong medical center), environmental and industrial. In others like ECE and computer, MIT is clearly superior.

If academic is your primary criteria, MIT is a clear choice.

6.<<<MITgrad>>>
WOW There is absolutely NO WAY that Michigan could possibly be even close to the experience at MIT.

At MIT you receive a top-notch education from the Undergraduate engineering ranked #1 school. There is absolutely no match to this, the atmosphere around you will be of incredibly intellectual and motivated students. The mathematic geniuses here are unmatched and it's truly an incredible experience.

Now for UMich it is a completely overrated university. It was ranked 22nd on US news and did NOT deserve such an incredible spot. The average ACT at UMich is 25-30, incredibly laughable.

If you want to be surrounded by a student body that is considered "above average" rather than a student body considered to be filled of geniuses then UMich is a perfect match for you.

You may have gotten $10000 to study for Engineering at UMich but as you said it is NOT worth going to a 2nd rate university that teaches in a second-hand environment, why would you want a worthless education when you can experience what an education truly is at MIT.

While UMich is a decent university, it is PUBLIC and 65% IN STATERS that dont belong there. 11% of UMich enrolled freshman are estimated to drop out. If you drop out of UMich you are pathetic, would you want to be in a student body that doesnt match your academic caliber?

I'm just sick and tired of people comparing UMich engineering to a priceless education at MIT. The engineering rankings FAVOR large universities GREATLY and this is the ONLY REASON that MICHIGAN is rated so high.

I'm sorry to be brutally honest but this is how it is, do NOT choose Michigan unless you want to go to a school that all Standford//Mit//Caltech//Berkley REJECTS attend.

If you were a REJECT like everyone else in the UMich student body then maybe UMich would suit you. But you are not a reject you were successful, anyone successful would NOT choose UMICH. In MIT we called that the "reject school".

Hopeless students can get into University of Michigan from MICHIGAN STATE. Exactly 4% of the student body is comprised of these hopeless transfers. If this doesnt depict UMichs lack of selectivity then I dont know what does. Just glancing through this forum so many underqualified students are attending UMich and got accepted. Why would someone with such incredibly intellect enroll in a school in which the smartest student at Michigan could not match the least adequate students attending MIT?

When you complete your undergraduate education at Michigan engineering you will be behind and underprepared for a top graduate school. Is this what you want? Is it worth the saved tuition to have to take a graduate engineering school that is sub-par? I know UMIch graduates who went to MIT grad school and were so behind they had to drop out. UMIch is an easy ride, you only go there if you want a half-assed education and an easy 4.0 GPA

Quality of education is important. The teachers at MIT are amazing, inspirational, and the research is incredible. The only reason that UMIch's numbers are so high is because they are a massive, massive university. If they were a privatized university with 2000 students they would be ranked out of the top 100 and rightfully so.

A college is supposed to be an intellectual center, how can you be intellectually inspired by your peers when they can barely tie their shoes? These rejects were not qualified enough to obtain a high-end university and you will be surrounded by them. You are probably incredibly intelligent and motivated, this would more than lower your standards. Just being around the UMich student body will lower your IQ by at least 20 points.

Once again I'll end with the fact that Michigan is an OVERRATED university and does not deserve to be ranked within the top 50!!

7.<<<MITgrad>>>
I'm sorry one last comment

The ONLY arguement could be that Ann arbor is a better town then Boston. UMMM, NO! ALL that UMich has to offer is sports, a significant portion of the student body is comprised of JOCKS that are completely inadequate. If you want to participate in sporting events, learn to tie your shoes and the alphabet, then UMich is your ideal school and setting. People think UMich is a lot harder than it is, DONT SELL YOURSELF SHORt. REACH FOR THE STARS, NOT THE OCEAN FLOOR!

8.<<<Collegeconfused>>>
WOW is this what the students at UMICH are like?

Funkmaster you need to chill..and use spell check

Thanks for aiding in my decision not to attend this university Funkmaster....Definitely MIT

I guess you're right MITgrad...wow I didnt know UMich was that bad

9.<<<MITgrad>>>
I'm sorry about getting so infuriated, it's just that all my anger from when people compare UMich to MIT builds up inside of me.

UMich is an above-average institution and deserves to be accredited as a good PUBLIC university. However when you compare it to the standards of a Private university there is no way that UMich can step up to the plate.

I was brutally honest and just saying what I'm sure many MIT graduates///other elite school graduates were thinking. UMich is good, not great. MIT is incredible. Case closed.

10.<<<lildude_ravi>>>
Do you ppl realize something suspicious?

11.<<<paracyst>>>
Seeing that I attend UofM, I wouldn't compare our engineering to MIT's (UofM has a great engineering program, but let's be realistic here). However, there are tons of other fields that this school excels in. Don't believe me? Take a look at all of the top ranked programs in business, medicine, etc. Oh, and have a look at a few links off the top of my head (not engineering links, however)

<url>http://www.collegejournal.com/bschool04/rankingsatglance/top50.html</url>
<url>http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0405/Sept27_04/18.shtml</url>

.... Yeah, I bet you can guess what I plan on studying....

The bashing of an excellent institution by the HIGHLY uninformed masses has got to stop.

I should not have to defend this school against anyone or anything, but apparently the education here is worthless and we have absolutely ZERO distinguished alumni nor anything of academic importance here. Yeah, ok.

And to the original thread starter: this school has plenty of your "type" here, as does MIT even more so. <u>You won't stand out at either institution.</u> If you do not choose to attend Michigan, someone of equal or greater intelligence will fill your spot.

12.<<<nirvanarageatm>>>
Ok back to the original topic...it depends on the type of engineering-some of the programs are quite comparable, you just have to see which place suits you best. (i.e. IOE and Biomed) There are many very intelligent people at Michigan as well as MIT (duh, lol), but you should visit both places and see which program you like better. Also, Michigan graduate engineering is consistently ranked in the top ten. Overall no school can compare with MIT in engineering and applied sciences (except maybe cal tech or stanford), but you will receive a first rate education (even if you consider it a second rate institution, which it isn't), from Michigan. Beware though that at either school, you will feel an intense workload in a competitive environment. BELIEVE ME there are no easy 4.0s at Michigan (at least in LSA and Engineering)

13.<<<Alexandre>>>
Collegeconfused, there is not substitute for MIT in the Engineering world. If you want a well-rounded education and a great collegiate experience, go for Michigan, get a great education and save $80,000 along the way. But if you want the absolute best in Engineering education, and money is not an issue and you do not care about your overall college experience, MIT is the clear choice. But you are wrong is referring to Michigan as a "second rate" university. Michigan is one of the nation's top 10-15 universities and Michigan Engineering is one of the top 5 or 6 programs in the nation.

MITgrad, your posts are complete excrement. The only reason I do not have them scrapped is because I personally believe in the freedom of expression.

14.<<<boysmom>>>
The fact that Collegeconfused claims to have gotten into the Honors program at Michigan Engineering proves he made this whole thing up.

15.<<<lildude_ravi>>>
yeah! that's what I was trying to prove ;)

and one more thing : MITgrad has all four posts in this thread

16.<<<Alexandre>>>
Clearly, there are many suspecious charaters. MITgrad has only posted 4 times on CC. All four where in the Michigan forum...all four were bashing Michigan inexpicably. CollegeConfused has only posted twice, and he somehow only posted in the Michigan forum...not on the MIT forum. Why would a person just ask one side and not the other? As for funkmasterlloyd, well, he is an entirely different story! LOL

17.<<<GoBlue81>>>
haha, I fell for the trick too. I got Collegeconfused mixed up with someone else who posted on one of those chance threads before.

boysmom and lildude_ravi, thanks for tipping us off.

To whoever it is...If you were a student in Michigan, you wouldn't have to resort to this kind of sad jokes for fun.

18.<<<hoedown>>>
Even if these are **** posts, here they sit for all to see. They're worth addressing

MITGrad knows a lot about enthusiasm one's alma mater, and about using hisrtionic language like "worthless," "priceless," "pathetic," "rejects" and "hopeless." However, his knowledge of higher education and his judgment on some rather important matter leaves much to be desired. I'm glad most people seem to take his post with a huge grain of salt.

No rational person would argue with him about MIT being an outstanding university. It is.

The basis on which he bashes Michigan are unclear but what he reveals is bizarre. An ACT average of 28 is hardly "laughable" seeing as it would place a student in the 93% percentile nationally. Test scores are only part of why Michigan gets the ranking he disagrees with. I can't imagine what he makes of the ranking of the engineering school (which has an even higher ACT average), but I don't think that matters given who we are dealing with.

The idea that in-state students "don't belong" at Michigan is beyond strange. As is the implication that all students who apply from Michigan are somehow inferior from any and all applicants from the other 49 states and numerous foreign countries. Of course Michigan's public status means it has some constraints on selectivity. This is not news. It still recruits a decent class.

As for the 11% "drop out" figure I don't know where that comes from. It's not a freshman year retention figure, nor does it match with annual reports of Michigan's overall graduation rate. Doesn't compute. At any rate, some students do leave Michigan. Not all in academic difficulty. Some transfer to a school which is a better fit. Fortunately, other institutions do not find this 'pathetic.'

The rest of his post is so crazy I'll leave it at that. LOL.

19.<<<GoBlue81>>>
Ha, but he wasn't consistent in his argument. Everything he bashed Michigan with would apply equally to UC-Berkeley (except UCB's SAT is slightly higher at the upper end)...but he couldn't bring himself to bad-mouth UCB engineering too. Alexander, are you thinking what I'm thinking? 8^)

20.<<<lildude_ravi>>>
I doubt that MITgrad is actually from MIT.... If he would have been, he would not have bashed Michigan so badly..... I can't imagine that people having attended such great institutions like MIT can have that kind of attitude....

As far as comparison goes, there is no doubt MIT,CalTech, Stanford are best in engineering.... and Michigan would come after that....

But do you people think that your success in future depends on going to MIT or Michigan? Do employers also compare MIT grad and Michigan grad (suppose both grads have 3.5+ GPA) while recruiting?

21.<<<tetrahedr0n>>>
lildude_ravi covers some points that I'm curious about. If we are interested in work directly after an undergraduate degree, in this case, in engineering, is a UM degree signifiantly disadvataged in comparison to an MIT degree?

Of course, I'm not in the position to make a choice, but can only hope so. I am, however, a MI resident, so UM is a great bargain.

22.<<<Alexandre>>>
Lildude_ravi, a 3.5+ GPA from Michigan will open many doors. Only the top 15% of Michigan's student body get such a GPA. Whether or not a 3.5+ GPA is equal to a 4.5+ GPA at MIT (MIT works on a 5.0 scale) is hard to say. I would say that equal GPAs would favor MIT. But a 3.5+ GPA at Michigan is greater than say a 4.0/5.0 GPA at MIT. I graduated with a 3.4 GPA and had job offers from Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan upon graduation. I also got an acceptance into Columbia's PhD Economics program. I chose Lehman Brothers in London over Columbia or JP Morgan in NYC. Later on, I got accepted in Kellogg and into Cornell's graduate program of ILR. I chose Cornell because it was exactly what I wanted to do. Most people I know who graduated from Michigan with 3.5+ GPAs got excellent jobs and into top 10 graduate programs (except for those who were aiming for Law or Medical schools). Those usually require GPAs in the 3.7+ range if you are aiming for top 10 programs. So, needless to say, a 3.5+ GPA from Michigan really opens doors.

23.<<<iolllloi>>>
Alexandre-That was a long time ago though ;)

24.<<<Alexandre>>>
Not so long ago. We are talking about 1996 (the year I garduated from Michigan and joined Lehman Brothers) and 1999 (the year I applied to Kellogg and Cornell).

25.<<<MITgrad>>>
UMich is not atrocious but it is nowhere near the academic institution of MIT, Caltech, and Berk.

It IS completely overrated and that is a FACT.

As I stated before it UMich engineering will NOT prepare you for graduate level engineering at the higher levels (such as MIT graduate). People go to UMich from MIT to boost their grades at an easy and overrated university.

The selectivity is so low that in a way grade inflation is practiced. I would say it is roughly 1/4th the work needed to complete at MIT.

Take the smartest UMich graduate and put him next to an MIT dropout and you will quickly find that the MIT dropout is exponentially more intelligent.

The engineering at MIT is unable to be measured because it is so unbelievable. At UMich it only reached such high standings because practically all rankings PREFER large universities.

Large universities are incredibly oerrated and because there are so many students attending it is easy as hell to pull off a "4.0".

If you were ranked in the top 3% of your HS class (lol) you will be able to get a 4.0 at UMich because it is incredibly easy.

Thats it, case-closed. I'm not going to argue about how overrated large universities are, however, I hope that other people can learn to see through it.

26.<<<Collegeconfused>>>
Enough is Enough!

Ok..first of all: I did not post my stats on the MIT forum because I have half a dozen friends that attend the university

I'm looking for opinions from students at the University of Michigan. I've heard from many (as MITgrad) that UMICH is overrated. I know little of the university and I admit, I am biased towards the opinions of friends.

MITgrad your post is extreme! Please state where you're getting your information from. I hear the university is second rate but come now, you make it seem as though you were speaking of Michigan State

Perhaps my first post was a bit arrogant, I apologize

I cannot say whether the claims of MITgrad are consistent with the facts. I am open to all of your opinions, please share!

Alexandre.. you seem the most knowledgable on the subject of UMICH. May I ask what the benefits of UMICH vs MIT are?

***Please leave out personal opinions! I'm interested in the facts

AND who is this Funkmaster character? WHAT THE HELL is i Are The Rise supposed to mean? Can someone please remove his posting privileges! What a waste of life!

One more thing...I was under the impression I was in the Honors Program (I assumed it was included in the scholarship) There is no Honors Program for engineering, I checked...Thanks for clarifying

27.<<<samwise>>>
If you want to make this believable, at least wait more than 23 minutes before responding to your own post. Honestly...

28.<<<Collegeconfused>>>

Choosing the college that's best for you is VERY IMPORTANT

I'm checking this site constantly for feedback on my question (a little obsessive I know but what can I do?)

29.<<<MITgrad>>>
Well this thread certainly took an unexpected twist.

Ahh Ignorance is Bliss now isnt it.

30.<<<MITgrad>>>
Oh and about your little genius UMich-inspired deduction that I only have 5 posts. This is because I HAVE another name, but obviously I wouldnt want to trash a school and get to a huge argument on my real CC name. You can say I'm a wuss but this was my way of revealing my true feelings, not going to ruin my CC reputation to do that. Ha, actually I'm pretty respected on the MIT forum.

You true intellectuals on the UMich forum couldnt deduce that, huh?

And...you think that Collegeconfused and I are the same person when we both post within 20 minutes of each other during prime time. Pure Genius.

All I did was state an opinion on a name nobody can identify me with, thats it.

for a supposed graduate from MIT... you're either really ignorant or simply looking to spark a few arguements.... or both.

I'll leave it at that. Everyone ignore him. He's flame baiting.

MITgrad and collegeconfused are the same people. They both joined in Feb 2005, have low post counts and only posted in this thread. Also, collegeconfused claims to have been accepted to a program that does not exist, an engineering honors program. In addition, they post one after another.

It doesn't take a MIT genius to figure this out

"GO TO MIT. Don't be stupid"

So what your saying is: Never choose UMICH over MIT because MIT is superior in all aspects? Is MITgrad's opinion valid?

38.<<<Alexandre>>>
Not really, in several ways, Michigan is surperior to MIT. For example, in the social sciences (with the exception of Economics), and the humanities, Michigan is generally superior to MIT. Michigan has top Medical and Law schools, MIT does not. Michigan owns and operates one of the nation's top 10 hospitals. MIT does not have a hospital. Michigan's student body is more well rounded and academically, more diverse than MITs. School spirit at the University of Michigan is much stronger than at MIT. Michigan is a center for the arts, MIT is not. Michigan has awesome sports teams, MIT does not. MIT's Business school is not superior to Michigan's. I would say they are about equal in Business.

In short, with the exception of Engineering, the hard Sciences and Economics, which MIT is superior to Michigan (but not by much since Michigan is ranked #5 or 6 in Engineering, top 10 in Physics, Biology, Mathematics, Geology and Economics), I would say that MIT is not superior to Michigan in many aspects of college life. It really depends what you want. If you only care about studies, and wish to study Engineering, the hard sciences and Economics, yes, MIT is superior to Michigan. Otherwise, I would say Michigan is at least as good as MIT.

In short, MIT is an amazing academic institution (top 5 nationally). Michigan is not quite as good as MIT, but it is also a very good university (top 10-15 nationally) and it is more versatile than MIT.

39.<<<vecter>>>
mitgrad, cool down, you're making us look bad.

Collegeconfused, I'm a freshman at MIT now and I must say, whenever I get to a career fair things are always looking great :) (besides the fact that I'm a freshman, but you can't hide from that haha).

We asked an IBM rep where they ranked MIT in terms of recruiting. The answer he gave was: "absolutely #1". He said that MIT was the only school in the country that they were doing 2 days of recruiting at. I don't know what the details of that second comment means, as I'm sure that companies recruit for more than 2 days ... or maybe he was just trying to be nice to us, but I feel that there is at least some sincerity in his comments.

Ultimately though, it's not so important what college you go to, as opposed to what you do there. Personally, I feel like $10K/year is not enough to justify UMich > MIT, especially if you're interested in anything related to the sciences. If money REALLY is an issue for you, as in squeezing out every cent is important, then take the scholarship and go to UMich. Otherwise, if money will only be a burden (I guess as it is for all of us non rich people lol), then I would suggest you go for MIT.

In terms of what Alexandre said about versatility, I half-agree and half-disagree. I don't know the specifics, but I think MIT's political science is actually ranked quite high in the nation (top 10 at least) and linguistics and economics is hardcore. I'm not going to argue that we have a humongous art/music atmosphere, because, well we don't (though of course we have the majors, classes, and clubs), but I think if you're relatively set on some science, then MIT is a solid choice.

Another popular thing to do at MIT is double major with a management degree (Course 15). Btw all the majors at MIT are called "courses" and are given numbers, as everything is either an acronym or a number. For example, I'm (planning on) double majoring in EECS and Management, and ultimately head towards a career in finance. The management degree isn't hard to tack on, because those classes aren't that much more difficult and there is actually a reasonable overlap between computer science and management.

"there's a world to conquer, Kevin" -- the guy down the hall

actually, we're gonna play basketball.

40.<<<Alexandre>>>
Excellent post Vecter. And yes, MIT does have a top 10 Political Science program, but Michigan is slightly better (top 2 or 3).

At any rate, I agree that if Collegeconfused is intending to major in the sciences, he should pick MIT. I also agree that $10,000/year should not alter his mind if MIT is the right fit for him. But for many people, Michigan is a better fit than MIT and to them, I would recommend Michigan. In short, the difference between MIT and Michigan is not that great.

41.<<<CC Admin>>>
i was gonna post something to shut up the MITgrad, but then i realized ignorant and uneducated people do not have capacity for a debate, they can only argue.

42.<<<hoedown>>>
It isn't clear to me why anyone would suggest a person is "an idiot" for weighing many factors in their college decision. The fact is, every year people turn down admissions offers from the most prestigious institutions on their choice list, and go elsewhere. Sometimes the reasons are straightforward because they are financial, but sometimes it's for other, more subjective reasons, or a combination of reasons. Perhaps some of you would always choose the better-rated university over any other, no matter what. Others may not. It has less to do with stupidity than some of these judgmental, flippant, unhelpful posts suggest.

43.<<<Collegeconfused>>>
thanks for the advice guys!!!!! :) :) :)

44.<<<nmg375>>>
MITgrad just has some crucial school pride. There is nothing wrong with that. I really believe no matter where you go you can get a good education. However, the more competitive the university (i.e. MIT over Mich) the more challenging it may be. Does that make you more of a person though?
If all you care about is the education and the core of kids around you, then go to MIT. I'm sure you will meet some amazing people who will motivate you beyond your wildest dreams. As for UofM, I think what makes it more attractive is the fun factor. That is something you can definitely not compare between the two schools. Best of luck with you decision collegeconfused. I think you'll adjust to you choice either way you go. If you go to Umich...I'll c ya there!

45.<<<Karido>>>
I completely agree with the above post, you can make the best of any educational institution that you enroll in. It is all dependent on the amount of work you put in.

46.<<<golubb_u>>>
"I'm sorry about getting so infuriated, it's just that all my anger from when people compare UMich to MIT builds up inside of me. "

MITgrad, your anger is justified to some extent. MIT, although not Ivy, is a great Engineering school! In fact, if MIT is good at anything it's Engineering, and for people to mention MIT and UMAA in the same breath may cause someone to have an uncontrollable fit.

However, price-conscious families and instaters also deserve to go to good schools. For the price, UMAA is a good deal. With hard work and perseverance, UMAA grads can also be successfull in life. Sure MIT grads will get their pick of jobs and auto-prestige, but with hard work and focus, UMAA students can get quite far as well. There's no need for you to be so fierce in putting down public schools.

47.<<<05_01_04>>>
To me, the $10000 shouldn't be an issue. If you really wanted to go to MIT, I think MIT would be worth the extra $80000. If you really wanted to go to Michigan, the extra $40000 off is just icing on the cake. MIT is clearly more prestigious than Michigan, and there will be tangible differences in opportunities available for students in the bottom of Michigan Eng. and those at the botton of MIT. However, a student at the top at Michigan will have (more or less) similar exit opportunities as a top student at MIT. (Again, however, there are those rare opportunities that are only available to the top graduates at MIT, Caltech, etc...)

I sincerely doubt that MITgrad is, in fact, an MIT grad, if only because I've never heard an MIT student talk about another school like that really. I've heard students at almost every single other top school talk about other schools so disgustedly and condescendingly (not that in the case of Caltech, it was pointed directly to and only to MIT). As another poster intimated, I think the histrionic and hyperbolic tone of his posts all but completely discredits him.

But back to the issue. You have to ask yourself, without the scholarship, "Would I prefer Michigan to MIT?" Note that this is a different question from "Is Michigan as prestigious as MIT?" Each school has it's advantages and disadvantages.

Michigan has big-time sports. MIT does not. Michigan has school spirit. MIT does not (unless, that is, you like spirit of the self-deprecating IHTFP kind, which is perfectly valid). At MIchigan, humanities are not just an afterthought, but are as prominent as engineering and the sciences. At MIT, this is not the case. At Michigan, you will have friends with completely different interests. At MIT, you will not (unless you consider class and hacks to be varied interests, which is perfectly acceptable). At Michigan, you get a college town. At MIT, you won't. (I don't care what anyone says, Boston is NOT a college town, and Cambridge, well, you'll see.)

At MIT, everyone is extraordinarily intelligent, even if they don't show it off all the time. This is not the case at Michigan. At MIT, there are no dumb jocks, or the slightest hint of a jock-oriented culture. At Michigan, this is not the case. An MIT degree, in and of itself, will open doors. A Michigan degree, again, in and of itself, will not. MIT is unquestionably considered the premier engineering school in the world, both by laymen and those in the know. Michigan is not. At MIT, you get the comraderie of suffering together at the most challenging education institution in the nation. At Michigan, you might get this, but you'll also have to deal with drunk sociology majors puking in the dorm hall and wondering "Why are you always working so hard, dude?" (This isn't to say that MIT students are fond of alcohol. They are.) Last, but not least, MIT is MIT. Michigan is not.

And regardless of the decision you made, make sure you think it's the right one. If you do choose the less prestigious school, don't think that you're alone. Turning down MIT (well, more accurately, choosing to go to my current school) was one of the best decision I've made.

48.<<<Alexandre>>>
I agree with much of what you say. There are a couple of points I disagree on however.

1) You say that there are some opportunities that will only be presented to the top students at MIT and CalTech. I don't think that is completely accurate. The top students at Michigan (Engineering or otherwise), will have every opportunity availlable to top students at MIT (or Harvard, Princeton, Stanford or Yale for that matter). The difference is, those opportunities are availlable to the top 15%-20% of the students at the "Big 5" and only to 5% of the top students at Michigan. But then again, there at 300-600 students who graduate at the top 5%-10% of the Michigan class annually. To take it a step further...some opportunities will be open to only the top 5%-10% of the MIT student population...but also to the top 1%-3% of the Michigan student population. Eitherway, Michigan is big enough and excellent enough to stay in the running when it comes to providing opportunties to its top students.

2) You say that an MIT degree on its own will open doors and that a Michigan degree on its own will not. That is not correct. I cannot tell you the number of job offers I got with top global 500 companies simply because my resume had Michigan on it. Obviously, a MIT degree is more impressive, but then again, a MIT degree is more impressive than all but degrees from 3 or 4 universities in the US. But a Michigan degree is still one of the 10 or 15 most respected in the nation...certainly as respected as some Ivy League (and equally good universities) degrees.

3) You make it sound like Michigan is a party school were drinking is a common problem. That is a misconception. Michigan is actually not a party school...more than 30% of the students are aiming for the top and the remaining students are struggling to keep up. The average student is studying pretty hard to keep her/his head over water. Michigan is actually quite intense academcially. Obviously, MIT is tougher...but again, MIT is tougher than all but maybe 3 or 4 (CalTech and Swarthmore come to mind hehe) schools in the nation. Clearly, in a school with 24,000 undergrads, you are bound to have many parties and a lot of drinking, but in that respect, Michigan is no different from MIT or any other top university.

Otherwise, you are 100% correct. I actually rather enjoyed reading your post.

MIT is a premier institution but a Michigan man had something to do with it.

Charles Vest, the past president of MIT got his MS and PhD from Michigan. He was also on the Dean of Engineering and Provost/VP for Academic Affairs at Michigan. He was student, faculty member, and administrator at Michigan for 26 years before he became president at MIT in 1990.

Forgive me for chiming in sooo late ... but if Michigan is such an overrated joke of an institution, then how come MIT has been hiring mostly UM grads to be their presidents these past 30 or so years? Also, might it be possible that MIT is "way overrated" in view of how they fare so poorly in the head-to-head solar car compitition that's been going on for a while now? (Or isn't truth in the results?) FWIW, a while back there was this MIT author on a certain nationally broadcasted radio show and he came off as one, big MORON.

Sad to say that public colleges are now pretty overrated compared to 2005. I do not agree with how MITgrad trashed U of M (seems like this was the only reason this thread turned into a flame-fest), but I also don't agree that you should under any circumstance choose U of M over MIT. Heck, most people wouldn't choose Berkeley engineering over MIT/Stanford.

66.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
"Sad to say that public colleges are now pretty overrated compared to 2005."

.............because you are such an expert on the subject?

"but I also don't agree that you should under any circumstance choose U of M over MIT."

Complete and total nonsense. Your comments are no better than MITgrad/Collegeconfused. You're acting as if Michigan were some community college and MIT was on an entirely different level. There is no question that MIT is excellent in engineering, probably the best in the world, but Michigan isn't exactly chopped liver either. There are many reasonable instances why a student might choose Michigan over MIT, especially if costs were significantly different.

67.<<<Alexandre>>>
TheBanker, I am not sure I agree that public universities are more overrated compared to 2005. Most public universities have dropped in the eyes of high school students in recent years as a result of the USNWR rankings. Michigan was a top 25 university in 2005, it has since dropped to #28 or #29. Cal, UNC and UVa have not improved in the rankings. Most other public universities have dropped in the rankings. If anything, public universities are now underrated compared to 2005, at least as far as high school students are concerned. According to academe and industry, I would say that nothing has changed; the top public universities are extremely respected...certainly far more than the USNWR would lead us to believe. Suggesting that Cal is not a top 20 university or that Michigan is not a top 25 university to a group of leading professors (regardless of their field) would likely get you a chuckle of ridicule. As far as they are concerned, the USNWR grossly underrates public universities.

"but I also don't agree that you should under any circumstance choose U of M over MIT."

That is a very absolute statement. What if the cost of attendance at MIT is prohibitive? There are instances where an applicant's family's financial circumstances will not warrant any need-based aid from MIT, but spending $250k on MIT would deplete the family's retirement fund. On the other hand, Michigan gives that student a full ride, which would cost that student's family less than $50k over four years. There are many such cases. Would you still not agree with attending Michigan then?

I have in fact known several people who chose Michigan over MIT, even when cost of attendance was not a factor. Those students really did not like the feel of MIT and felt that Michigan was a much better fit. In none of their cases did they regret their decision. They all graduated from Michigan and went on to the types of high-flying careers and graduate schools (most of them HBS, Wharton, MIT Engineering or Stanford Engineering) they had envisioned going to had they chosen to enrol at MIT.

68.<<<TheBanker>>>
Are you two recent college graduates or no? A lot has changed in the past 15 years that have really soured people's outlook on public colleges. Kids nowadays think that top public schools are overrated because of all the horrible experiences people have had with them (large classes, large tuition increases YoY, ect.) Whether or not this is actually TRUE is another story, but that's the general perception for Berkeley/UCLA in my experience. We send tons of kids to these two schools, and most were turned off by what they had heard from others. Fantastic graduate schools don't translate tit-for-tat to fantastic undergraduate programs, which is a defining characteristic of public colleges - their graduate programs tend to be better than their undergraduate programs. The international rankings contradict this because graduate school activity is taken into consideration.

In hindsight, Alexandre, you're right about costs being a factor. I thought MIT had a larger endowment, but at 1/3 the size of Harvard's, I guess MIT really can't afford to offer full rides to anyone who needs/wants it. (OTOH I have heard Harvard/Stanford kids getting full rides when they told admissions they were seriously considering another school, family income aside).

So - let me rephrase what I said - if money isn't a factor, then MIT is the better option.

69.<<<Alexandre>>>
You make a lot of inaccurate assumptions TheBanker.

1. While it is true that I graduated from college 16 years ago, I have research universities very frequently and have kept up with the recent developments.

2. Over the past 16 years, not much has changed. The main difference is perception among high school students based on USNWR rankings. If anything, top public universities have outpaced private universities in endowment development. For example, Michigan's endowment in 1990 was not even among the 25 largest university endowments. Today, Michigan's endowment is 6th among US universities. Only Harvard, Yale, Stanford and MIT have larger endowments.

3. Although MIT's endowment is one third that of Harvard's, MIT is significantly smaller (11,000 students as opposed to Harvard's 21,000 students) and does not have to operate a costly medical school as Harvard does. MIT is in fact extremely well off given its size and cost of operations, and can therefore afford to be very generous with financial aid. It is one of the few universities that has truly blind aid policies, even for international students. However, the upper middle income group (possibly the largest college-bound socio-economic cohort attending college these days) are stuck in a very difficult position where they are too wealthy to be extended any financial aid but are not wealthy enough to afford $65k/year to attend a school like MIT, when they can attend a top ranked public university for under $15k/year. Some parents may be willing to make the sacrifice, but many parents are unwilling to do so.

4. It is a stereotype that a university can be elite at the graduate level but not at the undergraduate level. This only occurs when a public university has no financial backing to adequately look after its undergraduate students. That is not the case with public universities with large endowments, such as Cal, Michigan, UVa and several others. Many private universities are also having trouble with their endowments. With the exception of perhaps 10 or 15 private universities, most are having financial issues similar to the majority of public universities, and are nowhere nearly as financially well-off as Michigan or UVa.

5. Another stereotype is that public universities necessarily have larger classes than private universities. It is true in many instances, but not in all, and the difference in size is almost always overstated. The difference in class size between many top public universities (like Cal, Michigan, UVa etc...) and most major private research universities is not significant.

6. I agree that if money is not a factor (a big if for most parents), MIT is a better option than Michigan. No doubt about it. However, fit must also be considered. Some students would not fit in at MIT and would be much happier at Michigan. In such cases, attending Michigan could make better sense, even if money is not a factor. The gap between Michigan and MIT just isn't that great. MIT accurately ranked (none of that USNWR BS) is anywhere between #1 and #5 in the country at the undergraduate level, and #1 in Engineering. Michigan accurately ranked (again, none of the USNWR bias) is anywhere between #10 and #20 in the country at the undergraduate level, and between #5 and #10 in Engineering. The gap isn't significantly enough to attend MIT to the exclusion of all else.

Quick points:
- I entered college recently, so my perceptions (and my friends') are the most up to date (#1).
- I'm from the West Coast and I get the sense the UC system has been significantly more impacted than Michigan, so that's where I'm coming from (#2).
- Endowment per capita is a more relevant figure than absolute endowment (#3).
- It's more of an issue with a large undergraduate population than anything else. Hard to keep high quality with high enrollment (#4).
- Class sizes are not everything - the quality of the student body is important too. The faculty:student ratio is double at a UC school than at my current private university (#5).
- Michigan vs. MIT really only becomes an issue cost-wise for Michigan residents and those who receive full rides (#6).

- Realistically, I don't think any aspiring engineer would ever consider giving up an MIT acceptance for Michigan, unless for certain personal/financial reasons.
- My sense is that if we look at cross-admit data for U of M and MIT, it's probably only a handful of cases nowadays (compared to 15-20 years ago).

I think we are more in agreement than disagreement. I get your point that there are certain exceptions where U of M > MIT, but those tend to be special cases. Heck, I know someone who turned down Stanford for a full ride to a Cal State (...why?). These things happen.

71.<<<Alexandre>>>
"- I entered college recently, so my perceptions (and my friends') are the most up to date (#1)."

Feel free to think that if you wish. It evidently makes you feel good to do so.

"- I'm from the West Coast and I get the sense the UC system has been significantly more impacted than Michigan, so that's where I'm coming from (#2)."

Fair enough.

"- Endowment per capita is a more relevant figure than absolute endowment (#3)."

Are you also factoring in state funding? Even if you do not, Michigan's endowment per capita would be 25th highest among research universities. But if you do, and you should, Michigan's endowment per capita is roughly the 15th highest in the country among research universities. UVa's would be #10.

"- Class sizes are not everything - the quality of the student body is important too. The faculty:student ratio is double at a UC school than at my current private university (#5)."

Now define and quantify the quality of a university's student body and how it impacts the classroom experience. Not that it matters. Cal, Michigan and UVa all have very gifted student bodies (certainly among the top 25 among research universities). Also, does your private university have the integrity to include graduate students when it calculates the faculty:student ratio? Most private universities don't. When you factor in graduate students, most private universities will have ratios of 10-13:1, which is not that much better than public universities with 14-16:1 ratios.

"- Realistically, I don't think any aspiring engineer would ever consider giving up an MIT acceptance for Michigan, unless for certain personal/financial reasons."

I would agree that the vast majority wouldn't, but there are some that would.

"- My sense is that if we look at cross-admit data for U of M and MIT, it's probably only a handful of cases nowadays (compared to 15-20 years ago)."

I doubt things have changed at all in the past 20 years. There were very few back in my day, and there are very few today.

Not necessarily. Many public schools have lower endowment dollars per capita, but they offset that with general fund state allocations. If you wish, you can treat Michigan's allocation as an additional 6 billion in endowment resources, bringing up the effective endowment to approximately 14.5 billion dollars.

Are you completely sure of that? There are a lot of private universities that like to fudge the numbers when it comes to the student:faculty ratios. A common tactic is to include all or nearly all of faculty in the calculation, but when it comes to counting students, they only count their undergraduates. It's completely ridiculous that these universities get away with it. It does effect the rankings, and it's completely biased towards private universities which have the luxury of avoiding state audits. I would be very interested to know what university you attend. I have a hunch that they might be exploiting this strategy. If you are interested, you can check for yourself on your institution's CDS. Look at the numbers they use for the ratio calculation and check to make sure they aren't only including undergraduates. There are very few universities (with the exception of LAC's) that have real student:faculty ratios significantly lower than the top publics.

Generally, I agree. MIT is one of the very few colleges that I believe to be significantly better than Michigan. Unless the student has to pay significantly more at MIT, they usually will (and probably should) accept MIT's offer. That said, there are definitely exceptions.

People should also take into account the experiences they are going to have at the university.

At MIT, are you going to attend football games with 100,000+ fans singing "Hail to the Victors?"

People overlook things like sports, the surrounding area, school spirit, the student body, etc. However, these things matter too. It's important that you enjoy your college experience. I could NOT imagine attending a college without exciting football Saturdays.

As a result, I would CERTAINLY choose U-M over MIT.

Additionally, the U-M College of Engineering and the Ross Business School have phenomenal reputations. Degrees from these schools can get you to where you want to be in life. U-M students are not called the "leaders and best" for nothing.

MITGrad, your post was rude and offensive. One of the worst I have ever seen at CC. I'm guessing that you are a product of the Internet generation. You highlight a reason to attend Michigan: more polite and humble people in the Midwest. Arrogance is the very worst disease that young people pick up in college. I don't care how brilliant you are. If you are arrogant, your life will be a ruination for yourself and everyone you touch. At UM, we care more about developing a complete person. Isn't that what education is for? Or is it for ruining the world with your genius?

All kinds of factors go into college choice. I know a woman who chose Stern College at Yeshiva University over MIT because she wanted a religious environment.

As for your disparagement of 'public' colleges, that's a canard left over from the rich WASPs of the 1920s. There's no difference anymore, particularly at the public Ivys. Same professors, mostly the same students. At private schools, you get lots of kids who attend only because of family money. For example, I have several friends who chose Mich. over Harvard because they couldn't afford Harvard.

I'll admit that MIT engineering has more of that genius mystique - even as I have several friends who went there who were not geniuses at all. But your characterization of Michigan was so foolish and off the mark. It shows again how arrogance distorts the mind. Michigan conducts $1.3 billion in research each year, far more than MIT. They can't be that stupid.

Michigan has a much bigger student population than MIT. UM has 27,000 undergrads. MIT has 4,300. If you take the top 1/6 of UM, the grades and scores are basically the same as MIT.

I went to UM undergrad. and Columbia grad. for a PhD in Economics. Both my professors and classmates at Mich. were superior to those at Columbia. Maybe you look down on Columbia too. Maybe you look down on everyone. How sad. And how bad you have made MIT look to those who read your childish post.

77.<<<seaslipper>>>
Thanks Fatsquirrel, I hadn't noticed the posting date.

My offense wasn't for the assault on UM in particular. I would have done the same for UCLA, Berkeley, and all kinds of other places. It's the chutzpah that I found astounding. There's another engineer, the UCB one, who **** here often and makes similar offenses. So sad how higher education has become an arms race. The purpose is to make the world a better place by helping young people and growing knowledge. That seems to be lost on people today. For one to talk so disrespectfully about a place like UM or similar places shows a lack of character. One needs a certain humility and respect for those who precede him. UM has done so much for the academic world in general. Has been such a leader and innovator of programs, such as most recently the first school of Information. Does the young poster like his legs? Well the polio vaccine research was conducted there. Does he ever Google or use Google technology? Well Larry Page was an undergraduate in UM Engineering. Did he learn more about himself and society from the playwright Arthur Miller? Well, he went to Michigan too. Did he become a Patriots fan in Boston? Well Tom Brady went to UM. You all know this of course. But it seems the concept of gratitude needs to be stressed to the ingrates of the world.

And then there's the question of coming into somebody else's home and criticizing the furniture. If you don't like UM, don't come into our discussion era. You want to make people feel bad about themselves? Our young engineer friend needs some courses in humanities. Does MIT have those?

As for UCSF, I urge you to read the history. And I usually only include UCSF for an apples-to-apples comparison when Berkeley's stats are compared to other universities with medical campuses. Medical campuses drive a lot of fund-raising and require some of the biggest expenditures.

I ask you, how does UCSF shed identity as Cal's Medical Center if it never was Cal's Medical Center?

There is a reason Cal didn't set up another medical school on the Berkeley campus...it already exists across the Bay.

Long time lurker, first time poster, as they say.

I apologize for resurrecting an old thread, but I felt an important point in defense of Michigan went left unsaid, despite "MITgrad" having been agreed upon as a ****.

I came across this thread while researching potential transfer institutions for an engineering degree. My situation is drastically different from the (possibly fictional) OP's, but I think that, while MIT of course has more prestige, simply having lower admissions requirements doesn't make the education itself meaningfully worse. This, of course, doesn't mean someone with a good background shouldn't choose MIT, but I've been heartened by the many Michigan success stories presented in this thread. Someone like me had practically no hope of ever getting into MIT, despite a perfect 4.0 in an accredited (and highly ranked among CCs) community college with core engineering classes. The extracurricular expectations and various particulars of admission are simply too specific and demanding for someone who's had to support themselves for three years while getting a GED, earning pre-reqs, and putting the basics of life together -- starting with nothing -- and then embarking on a rigorous program. I would have loved to take AP Calc in high school or had any research opportunities, but instead I've spent my time -- after pulling myself out of homelessness -- working in kitchens with ex cons and recent immigrants.

Michigan cares about that -- about the intelligence and tenacity I've demonstrated despite circumstance, about my passion for my subject that surpasses almost all others, about giving someone a chance to succeed that otherwise wouldn't have had that opportunity. I adore learning, and I'm smart as whip, only getting smarter (the environment, monotony and stress of poverty can actively dull an otherwise nimble mind). I won't necessarily have the same depth of technical background as my peers when I start next term. Besides my GPA and the work ethic of twelve Calvinist oxen, there isn't anything impressive on my resume. It doesn't feel like much right now. I will be grateful to both U of M and my community college when I graduate (not to mention succeed spectacularly, as I fully intend to), having a completely different life than I was otherwise destined to. (Despite theoretical class mobility in the US, it's still rare, and generally needs the type of boost an open minded university can offer.)

Even if "MITgrad" is a sockpuppet, I don't think his attitude is unique. Frankly, it demonstrates classism at it's purest. It more evident of a lack of wisdom and experience than a preponderance of cleverness. I am not hopeless, nor am I lesser for being unable to meet the requirements only those with reasonably decent people for parents and a complete high school education are prepared to. My advisers have said of community college, "You get out of it what you put into it." Beyond a basic level of resources, research opportunities, desired programs and good professors, I would be shocked to discover the undergrad endeavor itself doesn't obey that mapping. Most things in life do.*

The University of Michigan deserves to be lauded for it's discernment while being inclusive of capable applicants without all of life's advantages, not disparaged for that institutional strength of character. I'm glad many people here seem to agree.
