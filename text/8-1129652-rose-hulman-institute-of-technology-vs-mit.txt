1.<<<Bachman>>>
Hello all. I would like to hear from prospective engineers as well as people already in the field... what is the main difference between attending RHIT vs. MIT besides geographic location and size?

2.<<<JamesMadison>>>
Being #1 among engineering schools whose highest degree is masters, is like being the castmember of Jersey Shore with the highest SAT score.

3.<<<texaspg>>>
MIT - universal recognition.

RHIT - who are they again?

4.<<<gobeavs>>>
Well, to stick up for my school a little bit, I think RHIT holds a fairly unique position as an undergraduate-focused school. And I think the above two posters might be overstating their opinions a little bit...

To be clear, I think there *is* a difference between the two - not many schools are on the same plane as MIT. MIT has resources, reputation, and education quality that few schools can match. But, I don't think Rose is what JamesMadison and texaspg seem to be implying....I have a friend that just graduated from Rose who turned down Caltech to come here. Rose isn't a "who are they again?" school for those in engineering circles.

But, to get at the OP's question - I think Rose's focus on undergraduate education is one difference that could be seen in Rose's favor. On the other hand, MIT dominates in pretty much every facet of engineering and MIT grads are respected universally. Graduating from MIT opens a lot of doors, both for graduate work and in industry.

5.<<<texaspg>>>
Did nt mean to trivialize RHIT. I do have a couple of engineering degrees and so I do know the popular engineering schools.

As an immigrant, I heard of MIT when I was around 10. I moved here for my masters, lived here a couple of decades and I only heard about RHIT about six months ago when my kid got a flyer from them. So name recognition wise, I know more about Olin college as a school although it is only a few years old compared to RHIT.

6.<<<ClassicRockerDad>>>
There is a huge difference.

MIT is the pinnacle of engineering schools.

Rose-Hulman does not have a high percentage of students go on to doctoral programs. It's basically a small nurturing school whose graduates go out into the work force and seem to be able to find good jobs. Admissions are not competitive. In the USNews ranking, they seem to consistently come in first for undergraduate only institutions, but it's a joke to compare them with Harvey Mudd where 34% of their graduates eventually get a doctorate, or to Cooper Union, which another brutal small engineering school whose graduates consistently do extremely well. Both of those schools are much more competitive.

I do not think RHIT is that well known in engineering circles. I've only interviewed one person from their and he didn't get the job.

There is certainly a niche need for a nurturing engineering school for those that need the nurturing. WPI is another one. Most engineering programs, are more toward the Darwinian end of the spectrum and have very high attrition rates. Engineering is hard.

7.<<<BanjoHitter>>>
[quote]Rose isn't a "who are they again?" school for those in engineering circles.[/quote]

Actually, it is. I've interviewed engineering graduates for many years and have many, many friends that do the same. It's very rare to find an RHIT graduate and even more rare to find a recruiter that can tell you much about the school. I know more than most and I can't even tell you the city where it is located.

To generate a name for yourself in engineering circles, your school either needs to be top tier (Caltech, Berkeley, Georgia Tech, etc), very large (Virginia Tech, Texas A&amp;M, Penn State, etc), or have very strong industry ties into well known companies (Delaware, Mines, Cal Poly SLO, etc.). RHIT doesn't seem to have any of those three. Even though it's top among schools without a PhD program, that's like being the best hitter in minor league baseball.

8.<<<cosmicfish>>>
I am familiar with RHIT, and know a few graduates, but I would not consider it in the same league as MIT. It is respectable and produces good engineers, but as another noted it tops only one category, a category that omits all the genuinely top schools. RHIT is a fine choice for those who want to go immediately into industry and work for good solid companies, but MIT will place engineers with the BEST companies as well as offering far superior positioning and preparation for graduate school.

Maybe it's just me being defensive about my school (haha), but again, I think this is overstating things. "Rose is on the top of this list....but it's admissions aren't that competitive and its graduates don't go on to PhD programs in high numbers, so it's ridiculous to compare it to HMC and Cooper Union"... is basically how I read that, and I think that's a pretty narrow way of looking at things. You make Rose sound like a trade school for kids who need "nurturing". I don't think it's a joke to compare RHIT to HMC when every year on CC there are numerous posts comparing the two, and every year many seniors make a tough college decision between the two.

Obviously both ClassicRockerDad and BanjoHitter have first-hand experience in the hiring process and have a perspective on that than I don't, but I still find this analysis confusing. Would the arguments be the same if this was about Harvey Mudd instead of Rose-Hulman? It belongs to the "minor league" category of Master's-only schools. I think it's name recognition is *roughly* the same as RHIT's. Could some of this be regional? I'm not sure where Banjo and Classic are from, but being from Oregon I know that RHIT isn't well-known on the west coast. Similarly, I doubt Mudd is known that well in the midwest. But that doesn't make Mudd some cupcake school.

I think some of this is due to the comparison to MIT. I think everyone agrees that there really isn't a whole lot to compare. As ClassicRockerDad said, MIT is the pinnacle of engineering schools. Rose isn't at that level. But, I don't think that means Rose should be thrown to the curb (ie, a "minor league" school).

A comparison between Mudd and MIT would be very valid - they are each elite schools with different focuses. If a MIT-Mudd comparison is valid, seeing as Mudd and RHIT are frequently compared, I have a hard time seeing RHIT comparisons as a "joke".

10.<<<JamesMadison>>>
I actually looked it up, and "Snooki" from Jersey shore holds a BSEE from Rose-Hulman.

11.<<<gobeavs>>>
That explains why she got paid $32,000 to speak at Rutgers. ;-)

That is indeed how I view it when I want to hire someone awesome.
[quote]You make Rose sound like a trade school for kids who need "nurturing".[/quote]

No it could be an excellent choice for those who after HS are less competitive for top schools but want to be good engineers anyway. Ask the many people who have changed majors from engineering if they would have preferred to have a nurturing environment. IMHO, the nurturing environment is a plus for many students.
[quote]I don't think it's a joke to compare RHIT to HMC when every year on CC there are numerous posts comparing the two, and every year many seniors make a tough college decision between the two.[/quote]

What you are comparing is high school seniors making a decision on the way in. I'm comparing how recruiters and graduates schools make a decision on the way out. Both are useful measures. Harvey Mudd is a top source of future PhDs. Rose Hulman is not. Harvey Mudd requires you to have shown more evidence of talent on the way in. Rose Hulman does not.

I've definitely heard of Harvey Mudd on the East Coast, and we've had interns from there.

I think you should compare the outcomes of RHIT grads not with MIT or HMC grads, but with those that have been "weeded out" from less nurturing programs. In that regard, I have no doubt that RHIT excels. It's nothing to sneeze at.

I mean no disrespect, I'm just giving you my frank opinion on the value of the USNews Rankings that places RHIT ahead of HMC and Cooper Union.

13.<<<gobeavs>>>

So, do recruiters and graduate schools view Georgia Tech, UIUC, Umich, etc. the same way? They don't require you to show more evidence of talent on the way in, and they produce PhD's at a similar lowly percentage as Rose-Hulman. Taking a random student from Rose and a random student from Georgia Tech, they will generally have demonstrated the same talent to get into their school, and will generally have the same likelihood of going onto get a PhD after graduation. Does Georgia Tech get evaluated the same way that Rose-Hulman does?

I'm not a grad school admissions dean or recruiter, but I doubt that most base their decisions off of undergrad admissions stats and PhD production results. The US News undergrad engineering ranking that placed Rose at #1 for Masters is based solely on deans and senior faculty assessments, so we know that at least the deans don't base their judgement on it... If that is all that grad schools based decisions off of, Stanford would have missed Sergey and Larry (UofMaryland and UofMichigan) as well as many other quality graduates.

I hope I don't sound argumentative. I'll plainly admit that I've never been in on any admissions or hiring decisions, so I've got much less to base my knowledge off of than you do. I'm just trying to reconcile the data that I *do* have: what you've said here as someone who knows the industry, and what I've heard about Rose-Hulman from others in industry and academia.

14.<<<BanjoHitter>>>
I think you have your facts wrong.

Georgia Tech had a 2102 average SAT and 3.94 GPA average this year, RHIT had an 1870 average SAT and didn't release the GPA. They are not the same "evidence of talent on the way in".

Georgia Tech has over 50% of its students go to grad school, so it's certainly not sending students to PhD programs at a "lowly percentage". According to their websites, HMC sends 47% to grad school and RHIT sends about 20%. So GT has both beat in that area.

15.<<<gobeavs>>>
I compared the incoming ACTs at GT and Rose. GT incoming 25/75 ACT range is 27-32, while Rose's median ACTs are 29 English, 32 Math, which means the composite median is somewhere around 30. That's right in the middle of GT's range. I only looked at ACTs because Rose is in the midwest, where ACTs are more predominant from what I've heard. Freshman admissions GPA considerations are pretty worthless, IMO....HS GPAs vary so much and don't really indicate much when you're talking about everyone being top 10% of the class.

So, I would say the admissions stats are pretty similar.

As for PhD production...where do you see 50% of its students going to grad school? If that's right, I'm definitely wrong. I just got my data from another thread...for the time span of 1994-2003: GT had 757 graduates receiving PhD out of a total 18,825. 4.0%. (<a href="http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/college-search-selection/532397-list-top-phd-producing-schools.html" rel="nofollow">data</a>). Now, that's total graduates, not just engineering....but assuming the trend <a href="http://www.swarthmore.edu/Documents/administration/ir/baccorsum1995-2004.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> for other schools holds for GT as well, the percentage of PhDs in engineering and science is less than the total for the whole school.

EDIT: I think I misinterpreted the science and engineering data in the 2nd document to be a percentage of total science and engineering students rather than a percentage of total graduates. So, that doesn't really tell us anything about GT...but I still don't know where Banjo's 50% comes from.

16.<<<gobeavs>>>
I just ran some quick numbers, and I still can't find 50%.

<a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/georgia-tech-1569" rel="nofollow">US News</a> says 57% of 2009 GT grads were engineering majors, 4% are biological and biomedical science majors, and 6% were computer science and support services majors. Making the rough assumption that that distribution holds for the timeframe I had above, ~67% of the 18,825 total GT grads were engineering or science majors (12,612 total). Even using this number for the total engineering and science graduates - which is a healthy underestimate (math, physics, chem, other hard sciences are not included) - the 757 GT grads that earned PhDs would only be 6% of total engineering and science graduates...pretty close to the 5.4% at Rose-Hulman. (and that 6% is an over-estimate, remember)

Now, this is making several assumptions that aren't completely accurate, but I think it's a reasonable estimate. I certainly don't see a significant percentage of that 50% going on to get PhDs, which is the number we're comparing. (not just going to grad school, but number obtaining a PhD)

17.<<<cosmicfish>>>
Just to check the math, can you give a reference for the 5.4% PhD rate for RHIT? Also, where did you get the "757 GT grads that earned PhDs" from? I am concerned that you are comparing two different figures here.

18.<<<ClassicRockerDad>>>
I'm not really sure what you're arguing. I think you're trying to argue that RHIT is as good as HMC. I think HMC would push one much further if they can handle it. They tend to have more raw talent to work with. Then you argue that RHIT is as good as Georgia Tech, UIUC and UMich. I certainly have a lot more experience with those schools, and I tend to doubt it. I think those schools would push you very far too, whether you can handle it or not. A lot of people can't. If you're not making it at GT, you probably would have been better off at RHIT. Don't forget how hard to get into a school does not indicate how hard it is to get through.

Actually, recruiters view Georgia Tech, UIUC, Umich as large schools where you can go to interview a LOT of talent. It costs me just as much to recruit at UIUC as at Rose-Hulman and I will meet many more students, including those getting a Masters and PhD. I have met outstanding undergrads from all of these schools, but I have met some real losers from Georgia Tech. Obviously the school does not matter as much as what you do there.

In the end, what matters is how much you have learned and what your capabilities are.

Your total is clearly off. First of all, in a 10 year period Tech has about 30,000 graduates, not 18,000. Second, Tech grants more PhD's than that to it's own undergraduates. The number I quoted was undergraduates to graduate school, and Tech is over 50%. The 2007 comprehensive survey is apparently not online, but you can see it referenced in the student paper <a href="http://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/27475/buzz_spring_09.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a> "More than 50 percent of Georgia Tech undergraduate students go on to graduate school after graduation and the numbers are projected to increase." The same survey has the number of students enrolled in doctorate programs at graduation at 22% (and remember that excludes the students going GT BS -> MS -> PhD).

With regards to your ACT comments, along similar lines, no one takes the ACT in Georgia unless they struggle with the SAT. GT stats for this year are here: <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/atlanta/georgia-tech-applicants-will-876073.html" rel="nofollow">Georgia Tech applicants will learn their fate | ajc.com</a> 2104 SAT is roughly a 32 ACT average.

[quote]Also, where did you get the "757 GT grads that earned PhDs" from? I am concerned that you are comparing two different figures here.[/quote]

Same thread, 4th post. I'm concerned that I'm comparing two different numbers as well - haha. I tried to find a raw number from GT or elsewhere, but I couldn't...so I had to do some calculations.

The 2nd post has percentages, the 4th post has raw numbers. GT doesn't show up in the first post because the number of GT grads obtaining science and engineering PhD's as a percentage of total grads isn't in the table - about 4%. So, my calculations were all trying to reorient GT's numbers to obtain the number of GT science and engineering PhDs as a percentage of total science and engineering grads, which would be much closer to the percentage at RHIT (because *all* of Rose grads are science and engineering).

Also: BanjoHitter said 50% of GT grads go to grad school. We were talking about PhD-bound graduates, so I assume that he was citing that 50% implying that a significant portion of those would be PhD-bound. If he wasn't implying that, then I have nothing wrong with his statistic....it's just not what I was comparing.

21.<<<gobeavs>>>
[quote]Your total is clearly off. First of all, in a 10 year period Tech has about 30,000 graduates, not 18,000.[/quote]

Well, I cited my source. I don't think it's wrong. Here's another source: 8-year graduating rate is 80% for GT students. <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=georgia+tech&amp;s=all&amp;id=139755#enrolmt" rel="nofollow">source</a>. GT had 2,650 freshman admits this past year <a href="http://admission.gatech.edu/quickfacts/" rel="nofollow">source</a> Assuming this holds fairly constant over time, 2,120 of those students will graduate. Assuming GT's enrollment is the same year over year, over the last 10 years that means GT graduated about 21,200 students. That makes sense - my data from before was from mid 90's to 2000's, so GT has probably gotten a little larger since then. Am I missing something in my analysis? I still don't see 30,000 students graduating in 10 years. Do you have any data for that? Sounds like you're closer to the school than I am, so you probably have better sources.

Again, I cited my sources, all publicly available, and "showed my work." Although that data I cited before is 10 years old, it shouldn't be drastically different from today.

I won't argue that 50% of GT students go to graduate school. What I was comparing with ClassicRockerDad was *PhD-pursuing* students. As I stated above, I assumed you were quoting the 50% implying that a significant portion of those are PhD-bound.

The only thing I was trying to state was that the percentage of engineering and science PhD-obtaining graduates from GT was roughly the same as the percentage of PhD-obtaining graduates from Rose-Hulman. That's what Classic was comparing with RHIT and Mudd, so that's what I was comparing with RHIT and Georgia Tech.

22.<<<Chardo>>>
So, Classic/Banjo, how would you rate the quality of GT recruits compared to schools like RIT, RPI, CMU, JHU, Lehigh, and the Ivies? Sorry if I'm hijacking the thread, but it's refreshing to hear the opinions of engineering employers, and I'm sure many of us would like your feedback on other schools.

23.<<<gobeavs>>>

I wasn't arguing that RHIT was as good as HMC, GT or UIUC. I just didn't understand your argument for *why* RHIT wasn't as good. (which is better is fairly subjective and neither one of us is going to sway the other's mind....I just wanted to understand where you were coming from)

You said that RHIT required less of its incoming students and had less PhD-bound grads, so it wasn't as good as HMC and was viewed less by recruiters. I didn't understand why that made sense, so I gave you a counterexample: GT has similar requirements of incoming students and similar percentages of PhD-bound grads. I was simply trying to apply your reasoning for why RHIT wasn't as good to other schools, to show where I thought your logic broke down.

I agree. A recruiter would much rather go to UIUC or GT than RHIT, top-notch graduates and lots of them. The resources and opportunities at UIUC or GT (not to mention the original thread topic, MIT) are the best in the county. College is what you make of it, wherever you go.

24.<<<cosmicfish>>>
gobeavs - you are comparing two different figures. The first is the percentage of PhD's originating from RHIT, the second is the ratio of PhD vs BS graduates from GT - which includes those who got their undergrads elsewhere and omits those who get their PhD's elsewhere. Considering that most PhD's attend multiple schools, any correlation between these numbers is a coincidence.

25.<<<gobeavs>>>
Ooops, good catch cosmicfish.

But, to show that I'm not a total goof, I did double-check that data with another place originally, and that mid-700s number checks out. <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08311/nsf08311.pdf" rel="nofollow">source, page 7</a>
"Top 50 baccalaureate-origin institutions of 19972006 S&amp;E doctorate recipients"

"Georgia Institute of Technology...758"

So, the numbers still hold. I think. Am I wrong somewhere? (I'm worried now!)

Assuming I'm not making another mistake, that's a pretty nifty coincidence. Haha.

26.<<<fermium>>>
@jamesMadison

"Being #1 among engineering schools whose highest degree is masters, is like being the castmember of Jersey Shore with the highest SAT score."

I find the statement made earlier by you puzzling. The engineering schools found on the list are well known universities such as Harvey Mudd, West Point, Naval Academy.

So are you implying that RHIT beating all these highly selective and prestigious universities signifies nothing because they only grant masters?

Or are you implying Harvey Mudd, West Point, and Naval Academy are all crap in your opinion?

27.<<<ClassicRockerDad>>>
[quote]So, Classic/Banjo, how would you rate the quality of GT recruits compared to schools like RIT, RPI, CMU, JHU, Lehigh, and the Ivies?[/quote]

My company recruits at all of those schools, although I think just Cornell in terms of Ivies.

RIT is in a lower echelon altogether, but with the others, all I can say is that I've met some really talented people from each of those schools. As for Ivies, Cornell produces a lot of really talented people. The other ivies have much smaller numbers.

All of these schools also produce students whose resumes never see the light of day. The school isn't going to make you a good engineer. It's only going to provide you the opportunity to make yourself one.

28.<<<Chardo>>>
Why do you feel RIT is in a lower echelon?

29.<<<JamesMadison>>>
[quote]So are you implying that RHIT beating all these highly selective and prestigious universities signifies nothing because they only grant masters?[/quote]

It doesn't imply *nothing*. I just view the bracket they are competing in, as the "junior" division. Most serious colleges have graduate programs.

30.<<<ClassicRockerDad>>>
[quote]Why do you feel RIT is in a lower echelon?[/quote]

1) Fewer if any top students
2) Very low representation in top graduate programs
3) Kodak is no longer the powerhouse that it once was

Honestly, why do you feel different?

31.<<<fermium>>>
@jamesmadison

Okay, so you are *stating*, and not implying, that Harvey Mudd, West Point, and Naval Academy are all junior division, and not "serious colleges" because they lack graduate programs.

That's an interesting and aberrant belief that you hold. You are the first person I have ever ran into that considers Harvey Mudd, Cooper Union, West Point and Naval Academy to be NOT "serious colleges".

I don't have a strong opinion on where RHIT stand per say, but I definitely know how Harvey Mudd, Cooper Union, and the Naval/Army/Air Force academies are viewed by the well informed, and "junior division" is definitely not the words they would choose.

I bet A LOT of students on this thread would kill to have a chance to go to Harvey, and Cooper Union, etc..

32.<<<cosmicfish>>>
There are a lot of good programs that do not offer a graduate course. However, lacking a graduate course makes it a lot harder to demonstrate greatness - most measures by which schools are measured (formally or informally) key to graduate-level research. Schools offering doctoral studies also give students the opportunity to learn directly from cutting-edge experts, to take some number of graduate-level classes, and to participate in leading research - opportunities that improve their education and prepare them for graduate study.

I do not think anyone would argue that schools like Cooper Union or West Point are not excellent schools - they are - but there is a pack of doctorate-offering schools that match them in just about every way and then offer a whole slew of graduate-related perks on top. For the majority of students they are probably similar in what you learn, but lack the general awareness and the opportunities that can be afforded to the best students at places like Berkeley, GT, and MIT.

There are of course exceptions - Harvey Mudd appears to do a fantastic job of prepping students for grad study, and the unique nature of the service academies appears to offset any penalties incurred by the lack of a grad program. For that matter, every school has a couple of Rhodes Scholars or such, but in my experience the vast majority of top engineers and grad students at top schools did their undergrad at doctorate-granting institutions.

33.<<<RacinReaver>>>
I think the other big advantage to going to a school with grad students is, well, being able to meet grad students. It really helped a lot in my applications to grad schools being able to talk to a person or two that had already been through it (within the last few years), and sometimes their guidance in lab was much more helpful than a professor's.

34.<<<Chardo>>>
I don't necessarily feel different about RIT. It's just that it has been high on my son's list since visiting last summer. He was impressed with the co-op program and liked the campus. RIT is his safety, but he really likes it. Should I be discouraging it?

The low representation in top grad schools could be due to the co-op program. I would suspect most RIT grads go straight to industry. As for Kodak, not sure how relevant that is. RIT claims to have 1,900 active employers around the country in their co-op program. Fewer top students might present perks or opportunities for those top students who are there. Is this misguided?

S has the goods to get into MIT or any school, but of course you never know. We have toured MIT, Harvard, Lehigh, Cornell, RIT, Dartmouth, Penn, and Princeton. Next up are Hopkins and Yale this week. GT is definitely on the list, but that involves a flight to visit (won't happen unless admitted, same with Caltech and Stanford). Any feedback on these schools would be much appreciated. Again, sorry if I'm hijacking the thread, but it's all relevant.

35.<<<RacinReaver>>>
Chardo, I had applied to RIT back when I was applying as an undergrad because I thought the school was pretty neat, they had fantastic facilities, and a whole bunch of other things, but I wanted to do research for a career and the feeling I got from talking with people at RIT was that they were much more workplace oriented. I also got turned off a little since it was such a huge school.

Looking at your schools I'm guessing you're northeast, so you definitely might want to expand your search to Worcester Polytech (WPI), Rensselaear Polytech (RPI), and Carnegie Mellon (where I wound up going), Case Western, Rice, and Purdue (I didn't apply to the last three, but I've heard a lot of good talk about them here on the forums).

If your son is MIT material then CMU is probably a high match and schools like RPI and a very likely match. I actually found my admission and great financial aid offer at RPI to be very nice to have while negotiating financial aid with CMU.

36.<<<ClassicRockerDad>>>
If he has the goods to get into MIT, I'd drop RIT for sure.

I'd definitely consider Harvey Mudd if your looking at CalTech and Stanford. It's very unique.

If you thinking northeast, pick RPI or Northeastern for a safety. If you are looking more nationwide, Georgia Tech is a good safety, so is Purdue. Other possible safeties are maybe Wisconsin, Toronto or Penn State.

Consider Michigan, Carnegie Mellon, Illinois, and Rice as good overall choices.
[quote]Fewer top students might present perks or opportunities for those top students who are there. Is this misguided?[/quote]

I do indeed think it is misguided. The pace will probably be faster and deeper at a top school, the problems will be more difficult, and the expectations will be that much higher. If he's got the goods for MIT, I don't think he'd reach his potential at RIT.

37.<<<gobeavs>>>
[quote]cosmicfish wrote: ...but in my experience the vast majority of top engineers and grad students at top schools did their undergrad at doctorate-granting institutions.[/quote]

I think this may be the heart of the issue. This is true for everyone. Of course it is....doctorate-granting institutions produce the vast majority of engineers, and consequently the vast majority of top engineers. Pages 6 and 7 of <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/infbrief/nsf08311/nsf08311.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> study are interesting. Page 7 shows the top 50 science and engineering schools ranked by number of graduates who go on to get a PhD. All but two are doctorate-granting research schools.

On the other hand, look at page 6. If you account for how large the school is and rank them by the percentage of students who go on to get a PhD, *over half* are non-doctorate-granting schools.

(if you read the study it actually talks about how this pattern is true for the sciences, but is actually reversed in engineering. Take that how you want, but I think it's just a factor of students studying engineering in larger proportions at larger schools than at small, liberal arts colleges...now, if you want to study engineering most people *don't* want to go to some small LAC because they won't have the resources for a top-notch engineering program...but I'm referencing this study to just show a broader point about bachelors-only programs preparing people for grad school in technical fields)
[quote]page 5 of the study linked to above wrote: After normalizing for number of bachelors awarded 9 years earlier, more than half of the top 50 baccalaureate-origin institutions of 19972006 S&amp;E doctorate recipients were baccalaureate colleges, and most of the rest were private research universities (table 2).[/quote]

People are going to meet more PhDs who did their undergrad at GT than at HMC or Reed. But, that doesn't mean that HMC and Reed don't prepare people for graduate school - both rank in the top four for PhD production.

EDIT: This isn't to say that I would rather go to some LAC than GT for my undergrad. Employers and grad schools will be more familiar with S&amp;E grads from GT than a small school and so you will have an advantage just by virtue of GT's numbers (and the other advantages that Racin and others have pointed out). But, just because bachelors-only schools don't have the numbers of doctoral institutions doesn't mean they should be relegated to some lower echelon IMO.

Yes, but I have trouble with this study because they have no granularity - the survey includes hard sciences and health professions as well as engineering. I think that one of the reasons that engineering is so dominated by the large universities is simply because of the resources required by an engineering program - I know a few graduates of small engineering programs, and their experiences were extremely restrictive. Little lab time, few electives, essentially no opportunity to specialize. This is a problem both for industry AND grad school.

[quote]RHIT is ranked #1 among engineering schools whose highest degree is a Masters

They're different leagues. Rose Hulman had to beat out a few solid competitors: like Cooper Union, Harvey Mudd, and West Point - so being the best of the masters schools isn't worth nothing. It's not like being the smartest castmember on Jersey Shore, as those schools are decent competition. Nonetheless, to be the best of the phD granting institutions, MIT had to beat out Stanford, Caltech, all of the state flagships, all of the Ivy League, Duke, JHU, Rice, and WashU. That's a much bigger feat than defeating one or two serious competitors.

Anyway, I've never really thought all that highly of the USNEWS engineering rankings.

40.<<<Salve!>>>
RHIT and MIT are schools that should not even really be compared. Not because one is that much better than the other, but because they each have different focuses. I do agree with most of the other people though that MIT is a more prestigious university that will provide more opportunities, but let's not just throw out RHIT right away. To speak about the caliber of the students and programs at RHIT would require a knowledge of them. Something that I think most people commenting here do not have (not all, but probably most). It's true, RHIT does not send as many people to "top graduate schools", but I really don't think that that's a measure of its capabilities as a university. I was strongly considering RHIT as a college when I was doing my search. Why? Not because it was "#1 engineering school in the nation among those without a PhD track", but because I liked what I saw when I visited. If a person feels a better fit at RHIT than at MIT, then by all means attend RHIT. It will (hopefully) only benefit you in the end.

MIT is a fantastic university that has long held the title of the best engineering university in the world... but that doesn't mean it's right for everyone. You'll find "smart" people at almost any university you attend.

[quote]@jamesmadison

Okay, so you are *stating*, and not implying, that Harvey Mudd, West Point, and Naval Academy are all junior division, and not "serious colleges" because they lack graduate programs.

That's an interesting and aberrant belief that you hold. You are the first person I have ever ran into that considers Harvey Mudd, Cooper Union, West Point and Naval Academy to be NOT "serious colleges".

I don't have a strong opinion on where RHIT stand per say, but I definitely know how Harvey Mudd, Cooper Union, and the Naval/Army/Air Force academies are viewed by the well informed, and "junior division" is definitely not the words they would choose.

I bet A LOT of students on this thread would kill to have a chance to go to Harvey, and Cooper Union, etc..[/quote]

I never said that they are not "serious colleges" because they lack graduate divisions. However, I did say that MOST serious colleges do offer graduate degrees, so RHIT being #1 on that list does not mean a whole lot to me. It means a little, but not a lot.

RHIT might be the equivalent of being #45 in the list of colleges who do offer graduate degrees.

42.<<<gobeavs>>>
I was considering throwing this out here earlier, but didn't for some reason. I'm not going to bring up the RHIT/MIT debate again, but just want to show another perspective on how bachelors-only schools are viewed by grad school admissions.

43.<<<FlMathMom>>>
Thanks to all of you for offering your thoughts. My son is in the home stretch of making his decision and I would love to hear your thoughts. I will give you some background so you understand what type of student he is, not to brag.

Will be receiving an IB diploma; GPA = 4.0 UW, 5.3 W; ACT = 35, 36 on Math; SAT = 2280, 800 on Math; SAT IIs - 800 Math, Physics, Chem; 12 APs to date of which 10 were 5s, 2 were 4s. He is a very serious student, nerdy, math team type. Very self-motivated.

Accepted to GA Tech, Rice, UFlorida, WPI, Harvey Mudd. Not accepted to Caltech or Olin. Currently wants to be an Engineer focusing on computers.

He has narrowed his choices to GA Tech &amp; Rice. I've read dozens of posts about both schools, we have visited both for two days each and son has sat in two or three classes at each. Money is approx the same at both schools. Please share your thoughts. Thank you.

44.<<<ClassicRockerDad>>>
Personally, I think Rice is a terrific school for undergrads. I'd pick it over GT in a heartbeat. That's just my opinion. Others may differ.

Rice has outstanding faculty and his peers will be tippy top also. I get the sense that Rice students are much happier than GT students, without sacrificing the rigor. Both are very rigorous schools, but I think the biggest difference is that GT admits a lot of student who can't handle the rigor, whereas Rice only admits really top students. That's why GT sounds so gloomy.

45.<<<texaspg>>>
Rice is a private school, really small with a lot of opportunity and probably far superior talent.

46.<<<genevas>>>
It's important to also look at the actual retention rates of the students in engineering.
Many of the well known schools with grad programs do a pretty poor job of actually retaining their students. often as many as 50 per cent change majors due to this Darwin approach to teaching,. further more the internal burn out and mental health issues are significant in these programs.


It is also important to many to consider class size, approach to teaching, ability to do internship durning undergraduate engineering.......often that leads to excellent career options where as doing research for a TA at t huge school where profs never even know you are a student in the program do not.

Rhit student have gotten top internships prior to graduation. ....and something closet to 90
Employed in positions of their choice even in a recession. I know of many mitt Eng grad still without job 2 years after graduation...despite all their research opportunities......so yes now they are applying to grad schools.

In looking at some ot the top ranked Cal Engineering programs......and the top Large univ.
Programs students are in lectures of up to 400-600 student for all their core req,s
Then labs taught by TA s of up to 35-40 students.......?

RHIT is a small and specialized curriculum........one does specialize, and it is rapidly becoming more well respected nation wide , especially even in Silicon Valley when Standford and Cal are next door.

Look also at how students themselves rate their satisfaction with their experience!

47.<<<LadyGoGo>>>
^^^^sorry, but nothing that you posted here proves that RHIT would be a better school to attend for undergraduate than MIT

there really is no comparison here

in fact, the stats that you refer to favor MIT completely:

Student/Faculty Ratio
7:1 -- MIT
12:1 - RHIT

Classes with fewer than 20 students
65% - MIT
38% - RHIT

6 year Graduation Rate
91% - MIT
80% - RHIT

Freshman Retention Rate

90% - RHIT

Alumni Giving Rate

I don't know the specific numbers, but I have no doubt this ought to be a serious concern to many students and should not be taken lightly. The fundamental notion is in fact true. Many people who start as engineering majors find it too difficult.

That is exactly why I think that the fundamental value proposition for a school like RHIT is in the support it provides to the student who would otherwise get weeded out. I'm not discounting the value of a school like that, not at all. There is not only one right way to become a successful engineer.

But from the point of view of an employer, going to a top school and not only surviving, but excelling in such a harsh environment is in fact a higher level of achievement.

49.<<<RacinReaver>>>
I think that washout rate is for all schools in general, and you'll find in "top" schools that fewer people wash out since they're much better prepared for an engineering curriculum. I know in my undergrad I only knew three people that switched out. One to business, one to physics, and the last to math. This is a bit different from my brother's friends at the state school down the street.

50.<<<GLOBALTRAVELER>>>
I do not understand how can folks who either work in or have to the ability to work in...can turn a discussion about an academic and employment area such as engineering turn into a p*ssing contest. We are talking about an employment field where (in most cases) there are more jobs than what the schools can produce.

Good thing that this isn't about the communications major or the business major or the sociology major.

It's not that serious folks.

51.<<<RHITAdmissions>>>
I agree that it isn't that serious. I also disagree with the idea that someone with close to zero experience with a school or its graduates should speak about it and/or them with any sort of authority.

It's the same reason I won't say anything about MIT or any other school in this forum. I have never been to MIT's campus, never spoken with an MIT student, never sat in on an MIT class, etc.

I have no place saying anything about MIT other than I highly respect the reputation that has taken 150 years of outstanding success for MIT to develop.

52.<<<ickglue>>>
I think comparing RHIT against MIT is a frivolous exercise.

One is undergraduate focused, the other post-graduate.

One is an engineering rising star with a small student population akin to a top LAC like Amherst, or Swarthmore. The other is essentially a world class research lab with education as an adjunct.

The contest here is same as asking is Harvard better than Amherst?

The parameters are too ill defined in the original question to be able to produce a satisfactory answer. Amherst is exclusively undergraduate focused, Harvard is not, so how can anyone compare the two.

And by the way, Amherst is a feeder college for Harvard graduate programs. So RHIT could be one day become a feeder college for MIT.

53.<<<RHITAdmissions>>>
Well said, ickglue.

54.<<<warrior5>>>
Ladies and Gentleman,

As both an alumni as RHIT and MIT, let me offer an inside perspective on the topic. First of all I would like to defend my alma mater RHIT. Do not consider RHIT a minor league college. On the US News and WOrld Report rankings which you are all referring to there is a very important stats. On the list of the rankings, US News gives each school a ranking out of 5. RHIT is given a 4.6/5 which would place it 5th on the list of schools that offer a doctorate degree. MIT, Stanford, Cal Tech, and GT are all above them. So do not consider RHIT a minor league school. It's undergrad is very impressive. They just don't like to keep their school quiet which I am not sure why. Secondly, you can't really compare the 2 schools. RHIT is a undergrad driven school. The curriculum is setup to where they want to send their alumni out into workforce right after graduation. Kids that go to Rose are focused on graduating in 4 years and never going to back to school again. The majority of the 15% of graduates that go to graduate school fall under 2 scenarios (myself being the miority in this group). The first being students that did not do as well in their undergrad work as they wanted and they want a second shot at grad school. The second scenario is for alumni that want to go on to be a college professor. So that is RHIT, do not look at as a minor league school. That is a horrible assumption. Now MIT is a graduate concentrated school. They focus on reserach and gradute and dorctoral thesis. That is their goal. That is why they are so well known. They publcize their research which means more grant money from big business. That is their goal as instution but their undergrad is still really good. It was given a 4.9/5. The key is that you can't comapre these schools. RHIT is a undergrad based school where the professores that are there on focused on teaching and not research where as MIT is the exact opposite.

55.<<<jrcsmom>>>
MIT is an AWESOME school. Toured there with my son and there was nothing we didn't like about it. He was deferred EA and then rejected during the regular round. If he'd been accepted, there's no doubt at all that's where he'd be attending school. There really is NO comparison.

However, since Rose is 'in my backyard', I know a lot about the school, know many graduates, and definitely don't understand many of the comments here, I guess I'll assume they belong to the uninformed.

Rose isn't by any means an easy school to get into. Easier than MIT, well of coures, other than Caltech what school isn't easier to get into than MIT? It's the school around here when you mention applying, you get responses like, "That's a GOOD school. Good luck." When you tell them you've been accepted, you get "Wow, you must be a REALLY good student. It's a really good school."

It's the engineering school of choice for most top midwestern students because statistics still show that the overwhelming majority of students still don't travel more than 200 miles from home to attend college...frankly midwestern students aren't going to MIT or GT or Caltech or any other school more than a couple hunded miles away in big numbers, but to say top students don't attend Rose is simply not a true statement. Top east coast students, top west coast students don't attend Rose in large numbers (although they do exist there), but top students most definitely do attend Rose. I know of several class valedictorians who have attended there or are currently attending. In my S's graduating class *2* students were admitted to Rose.

When touring colleges, my son and I met with a professor in a southern school who had attended a west coast school and although had no affiliation with Rose or Indiana that I know of, encouraged my son to attend there, telling us what a great school it was, in spite of the fact that we were touring the school where he worked. To say that Rose is not known within engineering circles is also simply not true.

For those that say they don't know any Rose grads, that's most likely becaues it's a small school and most grads stay fairly local. But even during the recession, the local TV stations would show the job fairs at Rose and say that employers left disappointed - not because there wasn't talent there, but not enough of it. Even with 100% of students seeking employment getting offers, there were more positions available. There simply aren't many people graduating from Rose moving back home to their parent's couch. I work at a location with many engineers and know MANY Rose grads and they are very gainfully employed and happy with their choice to live in rural Indiana, and don't want the 'rat race' of living in a big city...not to imply that Rose grads can't go that route if they choose, only to imply that maybe that's why some people haven't run across many Rose grads, they're very happy to stay here with the low cost of living.

The students attending Rose are the same ones that are applying to engineering at Purdue and UIUC, which may not be the caliber of MIT, but are by no means 'weak' engineering programs.

To use the statistic about how many students go on to PhD programs is a silly statistic to me. What does that statistic imply? How many engineering students care to get PhDs? Why do they need a PhD in industry? Most engineering students only go on to pursue an MS because that's all they will need for their career path. To say a school is a lower quality because it is not producing researchers and professors is silly....it's just not a career path the majority of students are pursuing, but that doesn't make them a lower quality student.

Agreed that Rose is not the quality of MIT, but frankly as is stated over and over again, getting into MIT is a crap shoot even for TOP students - even with perfect grades and test scores the odds are against you. But to make a comment such as "I actually looked it up, and "Snooki" from Jersey shore holds a BSEE from Rose-Hulman." really just shows the knowledge level of the poster and not of the students at Rose.

56.<<<GatorNuke82>>>
The purpose of the post didn't seem to be to bash Rose-Hulman, though. Rather, the title is literally RHiT vs MIT. A direct comparison. Which is better? If you get accepted into both, which wins? No question. MIT.

57.<<<fractalmstr>>>
The problem I have with this rather condescending thread is that there is an implication being made by some people that <u>every</u> prospective engineering student has a goal of becoming a top researcher and/or elite 'ivory tower' academic. It's as if <b>everyone</b> had the same goal and <b>everyone</b> was in the same sinking ship feverishly competing to see who was getting on the life raft...

The reality is that not every student wants to become a top researcher and/or elite academic. In fact, *most* just want to become great engineers and live a comfortable lifestyle with their dog and 2.5 kids. Therefore, the real question becomes, where does a person need to go to school in order to accomplish this modest goal? The answer is: there are many good engineering schools that will allow a person to accomplish his/her goals. You don't need to go to MIT to become a great engineer or researcher, and to those who think you do, get over yourselves.

58.<<<ClassicRockerDad>>>
RHIT is a perfectly good schools to become a great engineer and live a comfortable lifestyle with your dog, 2.5 kids, and maybe even a spouse and a mistress added to the mix.

Some people find cutting edge research pretty exciting though. Not every HS kid knows what they want. One of my favorite professors Amar Bose just died. Google him and read about his life.

59.<<<colorado_mom>>>
I'm a MechE myself and did tireless engineering school research along with DS (hs 2010). I was favorably impresses with R-H, but DS never warmed to the idea of college in Terre Haute. However he did evolve to a preference for small undergrad-centric colleges. Olin (his final choice) and Mudd were tops on his list.

College selection is all about fit. Even if MIT had accepted DS and offered to match the Olin half tuition scholarship (hypothetical example - MIT has only need based aid)... he would have probably still picked Olin.

60.<<<blue0058>>>
Rose-Hulman is in the EcoCar2 program

61.<<<CSENG1>>>
Most of these discussions are biased and subjective. It is clear that many contributors have a preference for one school or the other and base their arguments on subjective points. Lets look at the facts and then you could base your assumption on that. If we make the assumption that starting salaries are a pretty good indicator of how employers rate a particular school and hence how "good" a school is, then we would rank MIT slightly ahead of Rose according to payscale.com who gave the average starting salaries of MIT at $68,600 vs. RHIT at $65,100 for 2013.
Yet its not that easy, when we look at where the students work after graduation we see that the majority of the MIT grads work in Massachusetts or NY while the majority of the RHIT grads work in Indiana or Illinois. For argument sake lets say Chicago vs. Boston.
Now things take a slightly different perspective, $68k in Boston is the equivalent to $56k in Chicago according to the CNN cost of living calculator.
What that tells me is employers are actually paying a premium for RHIT students, they obviously know the costs of living is less in the Midwest but still pay up for these students, over 9k.
So MIT may have the international rep and the headlines but employers are telling us that some relatively small school in the Midwest is producing graduates they are willing to pay a premium over MIT grads for. Quite frankly I was not familiar with Rose but apparently Google, Microsoft and the NSA are. I spoke to admissions recently just for the heck of it, (I have a son looking at engineering schools in 2016 and was bent on him going to CM or MIT) and apparently CS majors last year were getting incredible offers and the avg was close to 80k...

62.<<<boneh3ad>>>
[quote]CSENG1 wrote: If we make the assumption that starting salaries are a pretty good indicator of how employers rate a particular school and hence how "good" a school is[/quote]

Let's stop you right there. This is not a good metric. The logic you use to draw your conclusions almost makes sense until you look at the geographic distributions of salaries for graduates of a single school and realize that, when adjusted for cost of living, those graduates often make more in the Midwest.

This isn't to say RHIT is bad. Salary just is not just not really a good way to measure school quality. RHIT is still a fantastic school. It is so different than MIT though that I don't see a really good way to compared the two. Suffice it to say you will have plenty of opportunity for success coming from either program.

63.<<<cosmicfish>>>
[quote]So MIT may have the international rep and the headlines but employers are telling us that some relatively small school in the Midwest is producing graduates they are willing to pay a premium over MIT grads for.[/quote]
There are a few problems with this analysis.

First, the geographic distribution of graduates is not identical (as you noted) nor homogenous (as you approximated). While it is indeed likely that RHIT grads are on average going to areas with lower costs of living, putting a number on that difference is quite complex. Your number is not much better than a stab in the dark.

Second, the employment outcomes from these schools may well be quite different. Salary surveys do a poor job of addressing those students who go into grad school (as so many MIT grads do), or who gamble a bit by entering or creating a start-up company. On the first point alone, an MIT student is about twice as likely to go to grad school as an RHIT student (39% vs 20%), and payscale.com <i>specifically omits those with grad degrees</i>!

Third, <i>none</i> of this data comes from scientific surveys, they are all through opt-in reporting of salary data. It is a bit risky to place too much reliance on this kind of information.

64.<<<turbo93>>>
No Kendall Square at Terre Haute. 'nuff said :)

65.<<<colorado_mom>>>
MIT is a great school, IF it is the right fit for a student. But for most students comparisons are a moot point since more than 90% of applicants are rejected.

The accepted students should by all means visit during the school year - MIT was at the top of DS's list until he returned for a February visit. He just didn't like the vibe. He far preferred schools with undergrad, project emphasis - like Olin and Mudd. (He never warmed to the location of RH / Terre Haute). It's all about fit.

Note that students who are accepted at MIT (or are almost good enough to be accepted) will have terrific merit scholarship opportunities elsewhere.

66.<<<HPuck35>>>
MIT does have a great undergraduate research opportunities program (UROP). It is not required but I would highly recommend it. When I was there (many moons ago), I took part in a UROP project that was funded by NASA. It was a small group and we got a lot of face time with one of the senior profs who was heading the project. It was cutting edge research and a couple of guys turned it into their MS and PhD research. I got credit for it during the school year and it became, basically, a paid internship over the summer.

MIT, IMHO, places more emphasis on research than teaching. To go their and not participate in a research project of some kind is really wasting a good opportunity.

67.<<<NextElement>>>
I'll agree that the location of RHIT leaves a lot to be desired. Here in Indiana it's known as "Terrible Haute"

68.<<<CSENG1>>>
Once again lets try and stay objective. The labor markets are efficient and a excellent measure of a schools quality in spite of bone heads' statement, "This is not a good metric." I would argue it is the most important metric. Certainly better than ACT scores or subjective opinions. After al,l it is what employers are saying graduates are worth after they graduate and if it is not a "schools quality" call it "marketable skills", in either case it is meaningful and key measure.
The facts are employers are consistently paying a market premium for Rose grads especially when you weigh in the regional cost of living statistics. WHY?
They obviously agree with bone heads brilliant deduction, "that does not mean RHIT is bad."

69.<<<cosmicfish>>>
[quote]I would argue it is the most important metric.[/quote]
I do not disagree that it is a good metric, I just disagree with putting much value behind what is really a pretty minimal attempt to sample it. What is the confidence in those unscientifically obtained, geographically blind, graduate-degree-excluding numbers you noted? It is like saying "speed is an important measure of a car" and then judging cars by the morning commute times people post on your facebook page.

70.<<<boneh3ad>>>
The only way it's a good metric is if you restrict the scope to the desirability of each school's graduates in single industries in single geographic areas. Otherwise you have the influence of geography playing a much larger role than the quality of the school. You have to restrict it by industry, too, because obviously you could compare all the investment bankers from MIT to the traditional engineers from RHIT and come up with a wildly skewed result.

This is why I say it is a bad metric. There are too many other forces at work here that affect a graduate's salary besides the school he or she attended, and you have to account for that. Blind salary comparisons, especially from self-reported website surveys like Payscale, do not account for any of that and so are not a good metric for determining school quality.

Furthermore, I never said ACT/SAT scores or subjective opinion were better measures or even in any way valid. In fact, if you really want to know my take on what is a valid and objective measure, I'd say that I'm not aware of one that exists. This is why, and you can fact-check this, I always advocate that students select a school by matching it to their career goals and not based on an arbitrary ranking system.
