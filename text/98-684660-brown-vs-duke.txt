1.<<<knat>>>
I'm torn between the 2. I know they're completely different, and that I should just visit them to see which one fits me best, but I don't know if I'll be able to visit. So, fellow Brown fans, any opinions?

2.<<<hitsbigshot>>>
i actually have the same choice, and i also don't know what i want to study but am traditionally a sciencey person. however, i am leaning toward brown for the social scene, because really i think the academics at the two schools are comparable. plus im from new york so the new england environment will be more comfortable to me than durham's.

3.<<<beignet>>>
durham is not a hangout place. providence is.
theyre definitely comparable on academics, no question.
duke is more elitist, more frat oriented, more southern.

and then the big question: do you like duke basketball? for me as a UNC fan and acceptee, the answer is no ******* way

4.<<<dcircle>>>
neither school has a significant academic edge. if you're from the south you might find that people preference duke. however, if you're from the NE or west coast brown is considered the better school hands down. it's all fairly subjective.

my suggestion would be to choose based on fit. congrats!

5.<<<redsoxgirl>>>
I've heard a lot of people talk about how they like the social scene at Brown. What is the social scene at Brown like? Could anyone elaborate? Thanks

I should add that Brown has a lot of quirky departments (Egyptology, Portuguese Studies, etc.) that many schools don't have. The open curriculum is a great thing, as is the A/B/C grading system (+/- system at Duke) and option of pass/fail courses.

Brown also has the GISP option, which is pretty cool.

Ahh! I'm in the exact same boat as you. I went to visit Duke this past weekend and it was much more beautiful than Brown, but come on. Brown has the social life and I think I would just be happier there overall. Its a tough decision tho.

8.<<<MyOpinion>>>
Duke is more beautiful than Brown?? It all comes down to personal taste. Colonial vs neo gothic.

Duke- Only Duke Chapel, the Allen Building and Page and West Campus Buildings- that's it. If you happen to be at any of the two other campuses- nothing nice to see.

Brown- The Main Green, Van Wickle Gates and University Hall, Wayland Tower, The John Carter Brown Library, John Nicholas Brown Gates in winter, Marcus Aurelius statue and Sayles Hall....and I could go on, and on.

But anyway, I understand. It is New England vs the South (although neo gothic in the South seems completely out of place to me...) :)

I am a HUGE Brown fan (see my post above), but I would definitely give Duke a significant edge in campus beauty. Brown's campus is somewhat eclectic and, while reasonably attractive, definitely does not make it onto my beautiful list. Brown's campus always feels very crowded/cluttered to me.

Neo-Gothic anywhere in the US seems out of place to most people. :p None of the universities here are old enough to really pull it off.

10.<<<BrownBelle>>>
and I absolutely hated Duke, and currently attend Brown.

All my life the plan was to attend Duke, but I had a chance to study there for a summer (for college credit with undergrads), and it was nothing to call home about.

At Duke I would have had a great education but that would be about it. The community was highly homogenous, competitive (in a neg way) and only interested in drinking and basketball. The surrounding community is a whole 'nother world, incidents of crime are high and filter onto campus. Let's not even talk about the in your face racism. Professors seem really detached from the student body, and there really isnt a personal feeling to the education.

These last 3 years at Brown have been amazing! The education is comparable to Duke with the added advantage of being an Ivy. More importantly, most professors are accessible, care about their students and are genuinely interested in your success. There isn't an atmosphere of competition but rather of collaboration and learning. Ppeople are so diverse here which enriches the social scene. Regardless of who you are, I feel like at Brown you will find your niche. Want to drink yourself into oblivion every weekend - done. Prefer to stay home or hang out with a small group of friends - done. Want to dress up like a pirate and sing sea shanties at 2am? -DONE!

I am so thankful I had the opportunity to test drive Duke, it really just wasnt for me.

Crappy sports and no merit scholarships? ;)


I really love Brown (I do study Egyptology, after all), but most of your post is pure nonsense. I know both Duke and UNC very well, and they're great schools with warm, dynamic, and friendly student bodies.

12.<<<ring_of_fire>>>
Duke has a much better social life than Brown unless we differ on what exactly a social life entails. It is also just as diverse as Brown. The difference is that Brown students are weird(ahem *quirky*) while Duke students are more normal college kids.

Brown is also extremely, extremely liberal. Would you be comfortable in that sort of environment?

13.<<<MyOpinion>>>
[quote]Brown is also extremely, extremely liberal. Would you be comfortable in that sort of environment?[/quote]

I am always amused at comments that are just based on old stereotypes. Brown is no MORE liberal than Columbia or Cornell or even the University of Miami for that matter.

My sister always attended all girl catholic schools. We really cracked up when she told us that she found herself being more liberal than most of her friends at Brown.

14.<<<wolfmanjack>>>
yeah Brown isn't THAT liberal. but we do get worried about silly things like changing Columbus Day to "Fall Weekend", with one idea being "Indigenous People's Week" LMAO

16.<<<N21116>>>
I'm in the same boat as all of you guys, and am having a LOT of trouble deciding. I went to duke's blue devil days thing, and i liked it, and im going to adoch this week.

Im mostly undecided academically, but I'm leaning bio and maybe premed. I've heard that duke bio/premed is pretty competitive and very good, but I have no idea how good/competitive brown's is.

Help?

Duke has the stronger biology program, but I highly doubt there would be a significant difference at the undergraduate level (unless you want to study biological anthropology/anatomy). Reports of competition at Duke are highly exaggerated, from what I know of the school. The main difference academically would be the grading scale -- Brown grades on the A/B/C/NC scale, whereas Duke grades on the +/- system.

I'm sure you'll be able to make a decision fairly easily after ADOCH. Visiting really is the best way to decide.

19.<<<admitone>>>
Both are great schools. I personally prefer the Brown environment but I don't think anyone would fault you for choosing Duke.

20.<<<SeaShepherd2009>>>
So I've been to both. I went to Duke for a year and then transferred to Brown. Best decision in my life.

21.<<<vincentvega>>>
Honestly, if you're truly undecided, the easy choice is Brown. The Open Curriculum is perfect for exploring around.

22.<<<modestmelody>>>
So basically, knat chose Duke because he didn't bargain his financial aid package when he had a comparable one from another school and was convinced by some kids on the internet that grad schools look down upon the open curriculum despite all of the evidence to the contrary?

Then he took three visits to Duke (and none to Brown) to figure out that he liked it there.

I really hate these school X versus school Y threads, but I just want to make it clear that while I hope knat is really happy one year later, doesn't sound like he really wanted to go to Brown after all since he was swayed but pretty much nonsense information/lack of information. Of course, he states straight up that he was looking for pre-professionalism and I'd send someone away from Brown most of the time if that's the case.

23.<<<jonri>>>
OK, I'm a parent-though not of a Brown student. I am obviously very biased in favor of Brown and admit that. Still...this is my op of the difference FWIW.

There's no one social scene at Brown. There's no pecking order. Sure, there are some outstanding students whom everyone knows, but there isn't an "in" or and "out" <b><i>group. </i></b> There are lots of different social scenes going on at the same time. There really isn't a single typical Brown "social experience."

Duke has the "400." I THINK that's the number. The Greek system is strong --MUCH stronger than at Brown.There's a pecking order for frats and sororities. While, of course, there are tons of students who have no desire to join a frat or sorority and just don't care, there is an "in crowd."

One of the ramifications of this--at least I THINK it's a result of the Greek scene--is that Duke women dress up a LOT more than Brown women for day to day life, like going to classes. Roll out of bed, grab jeans from floor, race to class is fine at Brown but would make a female a little "odd" at Duke. On the flip side, if you like wearing mascara and lipstick to your 8 am classes, you'd probably seem a little "odd" at Brown. ( I just googled trying to find a link to the 400 thing and found this: <a href="http://web.duke.edu/womens_initiative/report_report.htm" rel="nofollow">Duke's Women's Initiative -Duke University</a> See the part under the heading Undergraduate students. It's good to know Duke is aware of the situation and maybe I'm way out of date, but I don't think so. )

Brown's strong in the arts. The theatre program is excellent. A capella is popular. Visual arts are really, really strong--especially due to the RISD connection. Spectator sports matter a bit, but not that much. Athletes don't get an automatic "pass," academically or socially.

Duke's pretty weak in the arts--at least in the sense of other students paying any attention to them. (My kid couldn't find a single tour guide who had ever attended an undergrad theatre production at Duke.) Duke basketball is, of course, very strong. The strength of the team leads to a RAH-RAH sense of communitythat Brown lacks--and frankly most Brown students are GLAD it lacks-- but many undergrads really enjoy. Jocks rule. It's sort of like a lot of American high schools where jocks are at the top of the social ladder automatically.

Supposedly, <i>I Am Charlotte Simmons</i> by Tom Wolfe is based more on Duke than any other college. (His daughter was a student there.) The book doesn't describe Brown. Oh Brown has just as much booze and drugs and sex as Duke does, I'm sure. But the role of the frats and the sports teams and the newspaper staff in the book is just not at all like Brown.

Again, I'm biased and admit that. I just think the social scenes are very very different. If you like RAH-RAH and think joining a frat or sorority would be great--and lots of people do--then Duke's the school for you.

We're not any better or worse on this issue than most other top schools, but for some reason people freak out about it more.

Being the poorest ivy, Brown is more solicitous and desperate to admit unqualified rich celebrities (and their offspring) than the other ivies:


"Brown raised its profile by enrolling children or stepchildren of politicians and celebrities, including two presidents, three Democratic presidential nominees, two Beatles and seven Academy Award winners. A particularly controversial case was the son of Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz, whose application sparked a debate within Brown.

Celebrity students generally lag their classmates in academic honors. But their prominence -- and that of their parents -- helped transform Brown into a top destination for students with a creative or artistic bent...Its endowment has risen from 29th nationwide in 1980 ($123 million) to 26th last year ($1.6 billion), although it remains the lowest in the Ivy League."

For the record, Brown is not the 'poorest Ivy' if one analyzes wealth in any sensible way.

29.<<<iamtbh>>>
An unintended consequence of the "Open Curriculum" is its appeal to rich and spoiled academically unqualified slackers whose parents are (for lack of a better word) "obligated" to contribute to Brown's needy endowment in return for their children's desired *wink, wink* admissions outcomes:


"In 1969, Brown eliminated requirements compelling students to take classes across the academic spectrum, part of a broad revision of its undergraduate education. The "New Curriculum" had an unintended side effect: <b>expanding Brown's appeal to Hollywood celebrities whose children hoped never to open another math or science text</b>.

Brown's lack of requirements was "a huge part of what made me want to go there," says Tess Curtin Lynch, 23, daughter of comedian Jane Curtin. As a student at Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, her grades were "brought down by math," she says. The first time she took the math SAT, she says she scored 550 out of 800. Her college counselor at Harvard-Westlake told her she would need at least 600 to be competitive at Brown. Her family hired a tutor, who helped lift her score to 660 (along with a 700 verbal mark).

Not only is Lynch's mother well-known, but her father is a Brown alumnus, giving her "legacy" preference. Brown alumna Nancy Josephson, an influential Hollywood agent, wrote her a letter of recommendation.

"I'm willing to admit I had the best possible set of circumstances," says Lynch, who graduated from Brown last year with a degree in art history. "I was very lucky. I don't know what my situation would have been without these steps up.""

An unintended consequence of the non-Open curricula at most other schools in the country is a glut of cookie-cutter kids who don't feel responsible enough to design their own educations.

Brown's endowment is in the middle of the Ivy League on a per-student basis. Making Brown out to be poor is completely disingenuous.

Ever wonder why you students of the "Open Curriculum" are not very "open" to self-inquiry and criticism?

33.<<<modestmelody>>>
I've spent years writing on curriculum issues at Brown. In fact, I've met with the external accreditation committee when Brown was up for re-accreditation, officials from other US institutions and three international universities that came to Brown to learn about the open curriculum (Kings College, Warwick, and Seoul National U), etc.

I have written several feature articles in the BDH/Post on the curriculum, often being critical.

You're a ****, plain and simple. This whole celebutante belief about Brown is tremendously over blown (even when it was describing the mid-90s when it was SLIGHTLY more true than it is today).

Plain and simple, this is just not something super unique about Brown.

34.<<<mgcsinc>>>
I'm not entirely sure what an article in the ProJo alleging favoritism on the part of the Admissions office has to do with my own self-inquiry or criticism. And it is not a rejection of self-criticism to point out that Brown's not poor. It's not.

35.<<<mgcsinc>>>
Like modest, I have also openly written critical words about Brown. I have at least 6 such letters in the BDH over the years. Would be happy to reveal them if you PM me and agree not to publicize my name.

36.<<<iamtbh>>>
LOL @ BDH. According to this article (paragraph 3, last sentence) in the BDH, Brown is an "academically rigorous institution." This is an odd description of a university which allows its students to take anything and everything pass/fail, not to mention does not have any +/- grades or distribution requirements of any kind. The "Open Curriculum" is a lot of things, but it is not exactly known for its "rigor."

Jonri,

That is patently untrue. Duke is fairly weak in the visual arts, but the performing arts are quite strong. Documentary studies and film production have long been popular, and Duke's dance program (particularly ballet) is one of the best anywhere and annually home to the American Dance Festival. Theatre is also very strong, and honestly, I'm pretty surprised you couldn't find someone who attended a show - I was associated with musical theatre at Duke, and performances are nearly always completely sold out. On the academic side of things, I had multiple theatre major friends (one of whom is now studying dramaturgy at Harvard) who raved about the department. There are numerous clubs and organizations devoted to the arts, and things like salsa on the steps [of the chapel], the annual step show, the Pitchforks (*great* a cappella group), Awaaz, etc. get A LOT of attention on campus (they seemingly took up about 1/5 of my yearbook).

I've never heard of this "400" thing. Perhaps you're confusing it with the so-called "Hopkins 500," where supposedly only 500 of the 4800 students go out on a regular basis. :confused:

Any post that mentions <i>Charlotte Simmons</i> makes me snort in derision - it bears as much resemblance to Duke as Harry Potter does to Oxford. Claiming there is an "in" crowd at Duke or "one social scene" shows rather limited knowledge of the school. (I don't mean this as an attack. I typically admire your posts and would be equally ignorant about, say, Grinnell or Lehigh.) Duke's social scene is remarkably diverse, and I think you'd have to work VERY hard to not fit in. In fact, I recently wrote about this very thing.

Brown is great school, and I thought it was ok when I visited, but I definitely did not get the impression that its social scene was in any way superior to or more inclusive than Duke's. I'm very jealous of the GCB, though; Duke could definitely use one.

yeah...the thing about duke is that it's not a cute little village atmosphere like brown is, with thayer street right next to campus. duke is pretty much in the middle of dense (but beautiful!) forest, and durham (i heard from quite a few current and former undergrads) kind of sucks for a college town.

46.<<<ava1992>>>
news flash: EVERY elite college admits unqualified (although I'm not saying that they all are) kids of celebrities/politicians. my sister goes to harvard, and she can list off a bunch, including students whose parents are just incredibly wealthy or well-connected.
and btw, those who take it seriously are supposed to use the open curriculum to take advantage of all of their courses, not to scrape by in college with classes that are easier for them. iamtbh, i don't know why you care so much about this--do you have a vested interest in putting down brown or something?

Why would you dig that far back to bring up this thread again? And where are you getting this information? I have nothing against Brown, but do you really feel so insecure about your school as to criticize others for turning it down?

What "evidence to the contrary" are you talking about? Yes, I wanted a pre-professional school. What's wrong with that? I wanted a college that will <b>get me employed</b>. I wanted <b>on-campus recruiting</b>. I wanted <b>my GPA to count for something</b>. Now, before the attacks start, let me say that of course, Open Curriculum, Providence, and Ivy League were all very appealing. But in the end, I chose Duke. Am I sorry I didn't choose Brown? <b>No.</b> Would I have been sorry if I had chosen Brown? Probably not. But in the end, between Duke and Brown, there's really not that much difference in terms of how you'll end up.

I know these X vs. Y colleges are very sensitive topics at this time of year. Current students are putting their own doubts about the school aside in hopes of convincing prospectives to choose their school. Pre-frosh who have made their decision are suppressing their doubts to reduce any cognitive dissonance caused by their decision (you'll notice that the Class of 2014 will typically be the most fervent and bigoted of posters at this time of year). But prospectives: in the end, your anxiety won't be worth it. Unless two schools are radically different (which Duke and Brown are not), then the only things that will prevent you from enjoying your college experience are your own personal inadequacies. And don't give me any bull about anyone not having any doubts about their school. Regardless of how much we love our schools, we can all name 10 things that we'd change. But we could also name 100 things that we wouldn't change, and that's what makes us love it. So I apologize from creating this thread one year ago, but I too fell victim to the flood of anxiety that comes with choosing a school.

Modestmelody, you too are a "kid on the internet." And after more than 4,000 posts, I'm sure you don't think your posts are as worthless as you're suggesting. Your posts were one of the reasons I started liking Brown when I began applying. Would it be fair to discredit posts that are no different from yours, aside from their sentiment?

51.<<<modestmelody>>>
Knat I didn't bring it up, someone else did. And I meant no disrespect to you at all, you probably made the right choice for you personally, though I disagree with some of your characterizations. My tone is largely a reaction to how other posters were spinning things here and it was my attempt to tell the "other story" in the same fashion, pretty much tongue-in-cheek so that students on here DON'T read more into things than they should.

I'm sorry this was not more clear from my posts but o largely agree with your sentiment.

Duke:
Affectations: Pressed oxford; Goldman Sachs summer-internship tote; always ending the party by taking your shirt off and wrestling a guy named Schmitty.

A peek inside: They're probably number one. But we'd rather not rank Duke number one at anything.
In ten years, will be: Still trying to re-create the golden age of banking while wearing driving mocs and no socks.


Brown:
Home of: The "Peace Sign on My Mom's 7 Series" ******

Affectations: A belief that grades, majors, and course requirements are just another form of cultural hegemony; using the word hegemony.

In ten years, will be: Living with your family in an old house that you quit your job to refurbish yourself (by overseeing a contractor) with painstaking historical accuracy in a formerly decaying section of the city that's recently been reclaimed by a small population of white guys in hand-painted T-shirts who are helping you put together a health care fund-raiser for MoveOn.org.

Douchiest course offering: English 200: On Vampires and Violent Vixens: Making the Monster Through Discourses of Gender and Sexuality.

Honorable-mention limousine-liberal institutions: Duke, Reed, Oberlin, Wesleyan, Bard, RISD.

One of the unique things about Duke is that it doesn't have an anthropology department. Biological, cultural, and linguistic anthropology are separated into separate departments.

Duke is hands down the better option for biological anthropology; Brown has virtually no offerings in that area. Brown is likewise the obvious choice for archaeology, as Duke has no anthropological archaeologists.

It's a toss-up between the two for cultural anthropology and linguistics. I think most would give an edge to Duke in the former and Brown in the latter, but I doubt you'd see a significant difference at the undergraduate level.

Have you visited either university? Duke was a university I didn't like on paper but loved after a visit; Brown was a university I loved on paper but hated after a visit.

Haha, On the opposite, I visited Duke several years ago, it didn't bring me any enthusiasm or passion, Why, i don't know, it's just a strange feeling, maybe the school culture's influence - i didn't see the diversity of the student body, nor visitor friendliness.

But while i visited many other schools (like Harvard, Yale..) i didn't hate them, this is another feeling.
