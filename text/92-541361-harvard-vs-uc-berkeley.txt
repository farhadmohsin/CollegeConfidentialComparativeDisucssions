i know its common sense that harvard is better....but what do you think?

2.<<<Phead128>>>
I can ask my friend who have taken math classes both at Harvard and Berkeley to get some opinion.

This is a dumb thread btw. Duke wins. :)

3.<<<Brown man1987>>>
Yes Duke is better.

4.<<<dark ninja>>>
no...c'mon people...lets debate this

5.<<<coolman123>>>
dark ninja, do you go to harvard?

6.<<<Phead128>>>
UCB graduate program wise probably beats Harvard or is on par with Harvard on a lot of levels. Both located in ultra liberal cities, infamous Berkeley, and the People's Republic of Cambridge (PRC). erghhh, I'd still pick UMichigan over Duke anyday of the week though.haha

7.<<<dark ninja>>>
hhaha...and i'd pick emory over johns hopkins any day of the week as well.

8.<<<coolman123>>>
^ I would too. So, do you go to Harvard??

9.<<<dark ninja>>>
and harvard is much better than berkeley...no question...when i was in london...i told a guy that i went to harvard...he was like "wow"...then my friend next to me told him he went to ucb...and the guy was like...hmm never heard of that place....well...i'm sure its okay...but its no harvard hahah...

10.<<<20LEGEND>>>
You might want to read post 13 again. :)

11.<<<DunninLA>>>
Ph.D. programs? Berkeley is much stronger.

Undergrad? The actual instruction is probably on par, but the reputation of H trumps all.

Berkeley Engineering

17.<<<Saxonthebeach6>>>
Harvard's got the $ and the student body. Both have the faculty. Berkeley's got the tree sitters =P

18.<<<Begoner>>>
Personally, I'm more partial to Berkeley's student body than Harvard's; alongside the geographic location, that pushes Berkeley over the top for me when compared to Harvard.

20.<<<rftd>>>
I go to Berkeley, so I'm probably biased. That being said, here's how I see it:

- Harvard's reputation definitely trumps Berkeley, hands-down. This is not to say that Berkeley doesn't have a good reputation (because it does), but, for lack of a better way of putting it, Harvard is Harvard. If you tell any person you went to Harvard, they'll know what you're talking about. Most people will know Berkeley, but still not as famous or well-reputed as Harvard.

- Harvard also wins in terms of prestige.

-As far as the level of instruction goes at the undergraduate level, I would say both are more or less the same. But, to be more specific, you have to break it down be program. I would say Berkeley has much better programs in Engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry, Biology, and Physics (if you look at Berkeley's track record on these, you'd agree with me). I would say Harvard is a lot better for English, History, Economics, Languages, Law, and other non-science subjects.

- For graduate education, you also have to break it down by program. I think Harvard easily takes the cake for professional degrees such as Law and Business (Although, it can be argued that the Haas School of Business is on par with Harvard). For Science-related graduate programs, it is generally no contest: Berkeley wins (once again, look at Berkeley's track record. Especially for chemistry and physics). As far as other graduate programs, I'd say its a bit of a toss up.

- Another way to look at is Nobel Prizes: Harvard has 75 affiliated Nobel Laureates Compared to Berkeley's 61.

Overall, I'd say Harvard does have the edge, but that is mostly thanks to its reputation. I think were the Harvard degree really helps is in networking. However, Berkeley is beginning to catch-up in that respect. Also, I wouldn't pay too much attention to University Rankings because those are mostly ********.

So, that my opinion. Even though I'm at Berkeley I think i've been pretty fair to both sides.

21.<<<rftd>>>
Also, Harvard has a lot more money. Which is a HUGE deal regardless of what others may tell you. (e.g. more money for research grants, etc.)

22.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
Harvard is the most prestigious university in this country. End of discussion.

23.<<<rftd>>>
agreed, it is the most prestigious... BY FAR. But there are other factors to consider

24.<<<DunninLA>>>
rjkofnovi -- OP did not ask which is more prestigious. OP asked which is better.

Regarding prestige, I believe this link says Berkeley is more prestigious at the Ph.D. level in 4 of the 5 main areas (which are comprised of 41 disciplines). The ranking is based on "faculty quality and effectiveness of program".

<a href="http://www.stat.tamu.edu/~jnewton/nrc_rankings/nrc1.html#RANKBYAREA" rel="nofollow">NRC Rankings</a>

Harvard takes the lead in the professional schools of Medicine, Law and Business, though in these areas Berkeley is behind Harvard about as far as Harvard is behind Berkeley in the 41 Ph.D. areas. In the popular culture, professional school superiority will have a much higher weighting than will have the 41 non professional Ph.D. areas.

25.<<<rjkofnovi>>>
OK DunninLA, Harvard is better. ;-)

26.<<<dark ninja>>>
yep harvard is better than little puny ucb...

27.<<<danielhstennis08>>>
wow, people WAYYYY overrate berkeley undergrad which really IS NOT that good... harvard is (arguably) the BEST OVERALL undergraduate institution in the country.... yes, in engineering, berkeley would be better though cause harvard engineering is a joke...

in terms of grad school, they are MUCH closer with Harvard still having an edge over UCB OVERALL....

28.<<<DunninLA>>>
danielstennis08 --

how is Harvard at the graduate level better than Berkeley? Per the link I posted in #26 above, Berkeley is the #1 Ph.D. university. It is ranked #1, and Harvard #4 (by simply aggregating the ranking number in the 5 main areas, lowest number wins -- with a slight bonus for having a ranking in all 5 areas). In the three professional schools, Harvard on average is #1 and Berkeley #4 or #5.

I assume you are making a qualitative judgement that the three professional schools together have more weight than the 41 Ph.D. disciplines? i.e. that vocational training trumps research. Is that correct?

29.<<<Bourne>>>
Why is UCSF considered Berkeley's Med school. Is there a literal affiliation?

30.<<<DunninLA>>>
When there was only one UC -- Berkeley, which was the lone UC until 1919 with the founding of the Southern Branch (UCLA), the Regents established a health Sciences graduate school.

It didn't fit at Berkeley for practical reasons, so they put it in San Francisco where the patients were. So, in the ensuing years, while some of the other UC campuses established medical colleges as part of their mission (most notably UCLA), UC Berkeley did not add a second medical school, since UCSF functioned as the "UC medical school" just as Berkeley functioned as "the UC" until 1919. They operated on opposite sides of the Bay from each other for almost 50 years before UCLA was founded.

I have always said UCSF is Berkeley's "de facto" med school, as this was the situation from its founding.

31.<<<Bourne>>>
So Berk has two top professional schools -- Boalt and Haas.

32.<<<DunninLA>>>
Bourne -- different take : The University of California until 1919 had two schools: Berkeley for everything except health sciences grad school, and UCSF, the health sciences grad school.

As UCSF does not have undergrad, it conceptually was and is the Med school for UC Berkeley.

33.<<<hampster>>>
In addition to having top notch ph.d programs, the quality of Stanford's professional schools and undergraduate student body are alot closer to Harvard's than Berkeley's.

For undergrad. it seems Berkeley's more on par with the other top publics.

34.<<<DunninLA>>>
Bourne -- I found a formal link between the two campuses:

The MD/MS Joint Medical Program

The UC Berkeley-UC San Francisco Joint Medical Program (JMP) is a unique five-year medical education program dedicated to training physician-leaders in the human, sociocultural, and bioethical contexts of health and disease. The first three years of study take place on the UC Berkeley campus, a short distance away across the San Francisco Bay, blending an innovative preclinical medical curriculum with rigorous research training. Students may take their graduate work in a wide array of subject areas well represented on the UC Berkeley campus  selecting thesis topics in the historical, social, ethical, epidemiological, or policy aspects of human health and disease. JMP students then transfer to UCSF for their last two years of study in the clinical core, joining the traditional track UCSF medical students. The JMP combines graduate and medical curricula leading to both MD and MS degrees. For detailed information, visit the UCB-UCSF Joint Medical Program site.

Applicants to the UCB-UCSF Joint Medical Program must meet all of the requirements of the UCSF School of Medicine and should apply through the regular admissions process. Applicants who pass a preliminary review will be approved for a secondary application from UCSF that will provide information on application to the Joint Medical Program. Each year 12 highly qualified students are accepted on the basis of motivation, background, and aptitude for an in-depth research experience and suitability for case-based, problem-oriented small group learning. While prior research experience is not mandatory, most applicants have had experience in the development of an independent or creative project. We highly recommend that students have completed an introductory course in statistics.

Keep in mind that I'm a UCB student:

I know my classmates wouldn't like me to say this, but Harvard is better overall (remember, this is coming from a Berkeley student). The only universities in the entire world that really rival Harvard are Oxford, Cambridge, and (maybe) Yale. Other than those three, there aren't any other fair comparisons to Harvard.

That being said, you have to remember that Berkeley is no joke (and far from it). Berkeley gets a lot of **** b/c its the poorest of the 'elite' schools in the country. However, I do feel that Berkeley does deserve to be put into the 'elite' class. I argue this for a number of reasons:

1) Berkeley's graduate and doctorate programs are as good as any available in the world.
2) Berkeley is top notch for various academic disciplines: it is the undoubted world leader in chemistry, and tied for the best in physics, engineering, computer science, mathematics.
3) Berkeley is a far better public school than some of the other top public schools (e.g. UCLA, UM: Ann Arbor). As such, it attracts some of the best and the brightest students from across the country and around the world
4) Though, not that same as that of Harvard, Berkeley has a terrific reputation.

As I said earlier, my argument here is not to establish Berkeley's superiority over Harvard because HARVARD IS BETTER. However, I feel as though some people in this thread are discounting Berkeley as being less than it is.

[quote]Rice/Baylor College of Medicine Medical Scholars Program
The Medical Scholars Program (MSP) promotes the education of students who are scientifically competent, compassionate, and socially conscious. It is the hope of Rice University and Baylor College of Medicine that these students will apply insight from the extensive study of liberal arts and other disciplines to the study of modern medical science.

The MSP students explore the entire range of Rice University undergraduate programs to the extent that their interests allow. After graduation, they begin their medical education at Baylor College of Medicine.

Each year, Rice and Baylor admit up to 14 incoming undergraduates into the program. The scholars complete the traditional four years at Rice followed by four years at Baylor for a medical degree.

Berkeley is harder to graduate from, the grading scale is much more severe, and you're forced to be more independent. Harvard has a bigger name at the undergrad level, but Berkeley is slightly stronger at the grad level. But this is a pretty stupid argument, esp. on this site, bc those who attend elite private schools are going to say Harvard bc the classes are smaller, it's more "prestigious," etc., while those who attend elite public schools will argue that Cal is just as good because you aren't held by the hand and are forced to find your own way, thus becoming a more independent thinker. So, to each his own I suppose. There are valid arguments on both sides.

I was only ranking Berkeley vs. Ivies

I'm not gonna sit down and do the calculations for every university in the US, but I think this is a fair ranking 1/2 international + national selectivity/prestige, 1/2 inter + national research ouput/impact :) I might do a few more later tonight.

I added Rice and Emory. I should stress though it's not the most accurate methodology and there's an emphasis on scientific research. Some schools, like Princeton, might have just not performed as well as they usually do, in the year 2007, it's a ranking that would greatly fluctuate from year to year.
+ There will no doubt be many (top 25 USNews) schools below Rice, don't pay too close attention to the numbers.

I think that Oxford and Yale don't rival Harvard...maybe I feel this way because I place more emphasis on scientific research...who knows. Stanford and Cambridge seem like comparable schools to Harvard (though still a half-notch below).

59.<<<flyzeggs>>>
CWalker, As much as I hate to admit it no university in the world rivals Harvard in terms of scientific research, I'd say the one that comes the closest is Columbia. In IF, Oxford and Cambridge place only in the 15-20th category internationally.

This is a silly argument. There is no university in the world that carries greater recognition than Harvard with the possible exception of Oxbridge. This Cal grad says, between Berkeley and Harvard, there is no competition for OVERALL prestige: it's the big H, hands down.

(Now ask me where I would go if I could do it all over again. I'd still choose Cal. Because there is more to life than prestige. And Cal has way better weather &amp; better looking people ;) )

65.<<<juillet>>>
Ugh, why is the OP so obsessed with this question of prestige? It's getting really old.

There's no question that Harvard has more prestige than Berkeley. It's the most prestigious university in the world; it's more well-known than Berkeley and most other schools, even Oxford and Cambridge. (And I don't know WHERE flyzeggs got the idea that those two British schools only place 15-20 internationally -- that is NOT true. Oxbridge routinely places in the top 5.)

However, as already been pointed out that prestige doesn't mean everything. At the graduate level, hiring committees are not concerned about what the general public thinks about schools -- they are concerned about in-field rankings. Harvard's name may get you far if you are planning to teach law school, but a Berkeley graduate degree is better for someone looking to be a professor in the natural sciences and engineering. Also, it depends a lot on geographical area, as well. Besides, the most important aspect about a school for undergrad is fit!

Also, darkninja, no one really cares that you go to Harvard, so you can stop making threads about it.

better ... in what?

Leaving all issue of "fit" aside (weather, size, geography, etc.)

- In the three professional schools? Yes, Harvard is "better" per most rankings.
- In the 41 Ph.D. disciplines? No, at least not in 32 of 41 of them, where Berkeley is ranked higher by peer faculties.

So you've got Berkeley "better" in the great majority of Ph.D. disciplines, and Harvard better in the three professional schools. You've got Harvard ranked higher as an overall undergraduate school (how is this relevant unless you are planning to complete all 50+ majors?), but behind Berkeley is many undergraduate majors.

So you see, it depends.

76.<<<flyzeggs>>>
juillet: The keyword is RESEARCH -> IF = impact factor. Go look @ the last HEEACT rankings/data from 2007. In terms of research impact yes they place very frequently in the 15-20 category (in terms of peer rankings they often make it in the top 5, which seems a bit contradictory (like THES), but I assure you that will change dramatically in less than 10 years). Ask any person who has moved on to either one of the schools from any top tier American univ. and they will tell you how overrated these two schools, and even more so most top UK universities are (in terms of research).

There are plenty of threads on this subject in this forum, just look around. They're known for their academic rigour (- engineering programs) much more than for their research. Oxbridge are still top research universities, definitely not top 5 though, sorry.

77.<<<flyzeggs>>>
"- In the 41 Ph.D. disciplines? No, at least not in 32 of 41 of them, where Berkeley is ranked higher by peer faculties."

78.<<<CWalker>>>
flyzeggs,

I moved on to one of those school from a top tier American university and I'd say that Oxbridge is on par. They may not have the money of Harvard, but neither does Berkeley and they get by just fine...actually better than Harvard as many have been arguing in this thread. As much as you would like to believe it, Harvard is not in a world of its own. I agree that THES is seriously flawed, but Oxbridge performs well in the Shanghai rankings too (which are RESEARCH based)

<url>http://www.arwu.org/rank/2007/ARWU2007_Top100.htm</url>

I can certainly live with Cambridge behind Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley

79.<<<CWalker>>>
I just looked over the HEEACT rankings and they are no better than any other ranking system...maybe worse. First of all, scientific research and publishing isn't everything. Secondly, do you really think that Caltech is the 32nd best university based on scientific research? The reason they are is because the HEEAT awards larger universities with larger faculties which in turn churn out more papers. It would take me a while to sort out what faculty # the HEEAT uses for each university, but I would bet that Harvard has a larger faculty than Cambridge which in turn is larger than Caltech.

The Shanghai rankings are a joke, 50% of the score is for Nobel Prizes and publications in Nature and Science, and it's barely corrected for size.

THES > Shanghai. I consider peer assesment scores, recruiter scores, alumni success etc... a much better indicator of a university's performance, and prestige, even though the process ia a bit mysterious and it's very hard to use the same method for every country. I'm not denying Oxbridge are great, I think 15-20 in research (which as you mentioned isn't everything) seems pretty right considering how many great American research universities there are...

Your right though, at least 6 of the categories used by the HEEACT are related to size and that can possibly account for why there are so many public American univ.s in the top 25 (And the University of Toronto -> 74000+ students)

I would also think Harvard has a much larger faculty.

But I should add those categories only account for 20%.

"research productivity (accounts for 20%), research impact (30%), and research excellence (50%)"

80% impact and "excellence" vs. 50% nobel prizes and publications in two (albeit the most important) journals in the natural sciences. Shanghai looks much more flawed.

[quote]80% impact and "excellence" vs. 50% nobel prizes and publications in two (albeit the most important) journals in the natural sciences. Shanghai looks much more flawed.[/quote]

I think it's more accurate to say that the Shanghai ranking has left itself open for the <i>possibility</i> for flaws; in other words, there's more opportunity for error to pop up in their rankings. However, you'd be surprised how highly correlated Nobel Prizes/publications and impact/excellence are. Thus, the rankings will be similar.

85.<<<flyzeggs>>>
Also the numbers don't add up correctly...

86.<<<flyzeggs>>>
Also the very stupid thing about Shanghai's Nobel Prize ranking is that it awards points to an institution if the laureate is a member of the faculty in the univ. at the time of winning the prize, rather than rewarding universities where the Nobel prize winning research took place. Pulications in N and S are also closely related to the size of the university.

UVA, UMich, and UCLA are all considered peer schools of Cal. And in my opinion I would attend UMich then UCLA over Cal, and I would guess a lot of people share my sentiment.

Just some perspective to keep in mind.

89.<<<danielhstennis08>>>
yea, bottom line... all you Cal undergrads OVERRATE it so much... if you're are an OOS Cal undergrad, you were definitely an accomplished high schooler... good job on getting there...

Cal is known for its grad school while Harvard is just all around great...

90.<<<kyledavid80>>>
^^ I too am from Illinois, and while even there I wouldn't consider Cal better than Harvard, I could see arguments made about Cal being better than Duke, JHU, or ND. This is purely from its reputation; I honestly wouldn't see much point in arguing about that, since each has its strengths and none is better than the other.
[quote]UVA, UMich, and UCLA are all considered peer schools of Cal. And in my opinion I would attend UMich then UCLA over Cal, and I would guess a lot of people share my sentiment.[/quote]

And a lot more wouldn't. Cal, I believe, is generally preferred over UMich and UCLA, if you look at the revealed preference rankings, which are flawed, though.
[quote]all you Cal undergrads OVERRATE it so much... if you're are an OOS Cal undergrad, you were definitely an accomplished high schooler... good job on getting there...[/quote]

I'm not even a Cal undergrad and I don't think that those here are "overrating" it. Harvard, while being an amazing school, doesn't have that much of an advantage over schools like Columbia, Berkeley, etc. at the undergrad level. I would say that Harvard overall is better than Berkeley overall (with Berkeley being stronger for grad school, Harvard for undergrad).

Either way, why would you say "good job" to those who get in OOS? Getting into Berkeley period--in-state, too--is pretty amazing. The acceptance rate is very very low, roughly 1 in 5, for in-state.
[quote]Cal is known for its grad school while Harvard is just all around great...[/quote]

Some would say that Harvard also suffers from the same problem Cal does: a lack of undergrad focus. Of course, it would be to a much lesser extent, but you get my point.

91.<<<danielhstennis08>>>
ok, UCBChemEGrad..... obviously you are biased... but anyways, berkeley is NOT a better graduate school overall than harvard... let's be serious... it may very well be top 5 in the nation though which IS amazing... the students in state that get accepted to UCB are "pretty amazing" according to you?!? i mean... that's a matter of opinion i suppose, but considering that the average SAT score of UCB is barely over 1300, and it is known to be MUCH easier to get into in state, one would think that the in state students aren't all that great on average... then again, i'm sure many are....

Harvard does focus more on grad school, for that is where the prestige lies... but it is still consistently ranked as one of the top undergraduate schools in the world...

and i don't consider UCB undergrad a peer to Duke and JHU (maybe ND)... those two are overall better undergraduate institutions, while UCB is an overall better graduate institution...

i really don't think this is all that complicated...

92.<<<Bourne>>>

93.<<<DunninLA>>>
danielstennis08 -- again, it depends on the discipline.

For the 3 professional schools (which I gather is all that most posters here care about), H is #1, Berkeley is #4.

For the 41 Ph.D. disciplines grouped into 5 major areas, Berkeley is #1 and H is #4.

There are two answers to which is better for grad school.

94.<<<kyledavid80>>>
[quote]but anyways, berkeley is NOT a better graduate school overall than harvard[/quote]

Uh, I'd say it is. Berkeley was ranked in the top 10 in 35 disciplines, compared to Harvard's 25. In the US News rankings, Berkeley was ranked in the top 10 in all of them.
[quote]that the in state students aren't all that great on average[/quote]

I'm sorry that CC has corrupted your mind so much that you consider top students like those at Berkeley to be "not all that great."
[quote]those two are overall better undergraduate institutions, while UCB is an overall better graduate institution...[/quote]

I can see why you think that. FWIW, I'd easily choose Cal over JHU and Duke even if they are "better" for undergrad (because, in my opinion, there are more important things than the % classes under 20 and the alumni giving rates).

It's hard to say that they "kick Cal's ass" in BME when Berkeley is also ranked in the top 10. Please tell me what other ("many many") areas that Duke and JHU beat Cal in. Then I can tell you all the areas that Cal beats Duke and JHU in. :)

(All of Berkeley's programs are consistently ranked in the top 10. Duke/JHU can only claim a handful. In fact, in the five main areas, no other university has the breadth and depth that Cal has, but a few come close. In world rankings of the main areas of study, Harvard and Berkeley ranked at the top. Duke and JHU didn't even come close.)

There's something to be said for attending school at the worlds second largest non-profit organization (behind only the Bill and Melina Gates Foundation).

There's also a certain something to be said for being able to say, "I went to Harvard," and ANYONE ANYWHERE will know the exact school you're talking about.

Let me just say they're both fine schools in academics, and probably little difference exists. So you must turn to what's different between the two. I've just given fine examples of two.

Berkelely's only ranked a few spots behind JHU. Considering that there are some 4,200 colleges, you're talking about the difference between being better than 99.8% of colleges and being better than 99.5% of colleges. It's petty to see such incremental differences.

Or, if you like parallelism, in quality of programs and faculty, Duke and JHU don't even come close to Berkeley... deal with it. :]

I'm sorry but one BS USNews ranking (which I can tell it really is just by looking at the neuroscience rankings) is not enough justification to say that Berkeley grad is better than Harvard. Berkeley's star is fading, in many areas it has been eclipsed by UCLA (overall Cal >>>>>>>>>>>>UCLA). And don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Cal but it's foolish to deny certain realities and I'm not saying that other public research oriented universities don't have their share of problems.

Cal students from California are (for the most part) in the top 10% of their class, which isn't exactly Harvard, but it's not at all as bad as some of you make it. My suggestion though to anyone who has studied or worked in Berkeley is to check other "top" dept.'s facilities because it is not at all well funded for a university of its size (UMich has a much higher endowment and spends nearly twice as much annually on research, 15,000 vs. 10,000 postgrads). But one thing is for sure, at the grad level Berkeley attracts some of the best students in the country and I really like the fact that they look for people who are into their fields and doing research more than anything (this is the impression I got while working there during the summer) it gives a person like me (who doesn't have the greatest marks in the world) hope that all his "passion" and research experience might actually amount to something.

You mean Duke student body on average has higher SAT scores, smaller class sizes, and larger endowment per undergraduate student. Advising, grants/stipends for study abroad/civic engagement and alumni satisfaction...I need to see more proof.

^See, that's a valid reason for going to a place like Cal over a top 10 school. If it doesn't have the major you're interested in...

Alumni satisfaction can be seen by extremely high alumni giving rate that Duke has yearly. This year it is #2 I believe behind Princeton.

Also, Duke has launched the most ambitious service-learning program of any college in the country recently: <a href="http://dukeengage.duke.edu/" rel="nofollow">DukeEngage | Home</a>

I daresay Berkeley has maintained its dominance in its quality of programs. It goes out of its way to maintain themwhether in top faculty, top facilities, broad library holdings, etc. In the last NRC ranking, UCLA beat Cal in only a small handful of disciplines, and in those Cal was also ranked in the top 10 (so not much difference). And in all the rest? Cal eclipsed UCLA.
[quote]Berkeley is to check other "top" dept.'s facilities because it is not at all well funded for a university of its size[/quote]

Do you want to substantiate that claim? Berkeley spends over $500 million on non-medical research; if you count UCSFs spending on research (to make comparisons more equal), it spends more on research than any other university, including JHU. And thats not even counting the research funding at the labs that Berkeley manages.

Believe me: Berkeleys facilities are constantly being added to and upgraded. Theyre probably on par with other top departments facilities, more likely than not. (In some cases, betterBerkeleys phonology lab leaves most top ones in the dust, etc.) These facilities, by the way, are often, if not usually, available to undergrads.

Here is the Duke syndrome again. Yet another Duke alum that needs to try to bolster the rep of his school by claiming it's better than it actually is and proceeding to belittle other schools to feel better about himself and his school.

Guys, if Duke is so great then why do you need to convince us? I don't see MIT alums parading around this forum stating "MIT is arguably a top five institution, whereas Caltech is a solid top 10 school, and Berkeley isn't even close. MIT is better than your school" or "MIT kills Berkeley in every conceivable measure of undergraduate quality."

Why? Because it is obviously understood that MIT is great. Duke on the other hand... I always see Duke alums playing up their school and putting down others. If you guys are secure about your school's status as an elite institution, and really think Duke is as great as you all make it out to be, putting down other schools is not necessary.

Ok I have no affiliation with Duke or interest in attending. Yet, you people continually deride anyone who says anything complimentary toward Duke and then in the height of hypocrisy make Berkeley out to be a top 5/10 undergrad university.

I could say the same about Berkeley?

Berkeley is a great school, but it is not nearly as good as Harvard or Duke. Is it comparable to JHU....maybe, but anywhere outside the west coast Berkeley is just considered a top state school.....not a top top university (like HYPSM or even the next tier).

It's okay to say Duke is an awesome school and be proud of your school if you are a Duke alum. But if Duke students are really secure about their schools reputation as a top university, it's not necessary to parade these forums and say Duke is better than schools X, Y, and Z. It should just be obvious. Students from other elite schools don't go around doing this so there has to be something wrong with the select Duke students that do this. For instance, everyone knows Harvard is a great school, but do you see its alums parading these forums stating "Harvard is better than Berkeley in every conceivable measure of undergraduate quality?"

Berkeley students don't parade these forums and claim that their school is better than other people's schools. Duke students do, and Berkeley students are just defending their own school.

I have no affiliation with either school but I am sick and tired of Duke kids/alums going around and stating things like "Duke kills Berkeley in every conceivable measure of undergraduate quality." If you all really think your school is so great, its reputation should speak for itself. Otherwise, all I see is insecurity.

I daresay Stanford's is more established, elaborate, and significant, and will probably continue to be so. Stanford emphasizes service learning in all its descriptions of the education it gives. (In fact, Stanford requires its undergrads to take ethics courses, in following Leland Stanford's idea that undergrads should be trained to be helpful citizens--again alluding to service learning.)

Duke and Berkeley are peers. Duke students want to think otherwise because they are spending up to 4 times more than the average Berk student, ofcourse they'll want to think that Duke is better. I am from FL and Duke is respected but so is Berkeley but also alot of ppl around where I am from think Duke is just a bunch of rich kids who payed their way into the school. Berkeley is also seen by alot as just a hippie school. Neither rep is really acurate. I will be the first to admit Berkeley is not on the level of HYSPM, in general public opinion in the US, but neither is Duke. Berkeley is making significant efforts to increase alumni participation and giving. Its a public school and does not have the tradition of giving...yet. This year the student call center surpassed last year's net total in donations by over 33%, and thats during a rough economic period. Also this year athletics raised over ten million.... less than five years ago it was only around 4 million. And isn't this thread about Harvard vs Berkeley. UG rep Harvard>>Berkeley Grad rep Harvard=Berkeley UG quality probably Harvard but I have talked to a couple grad students at Berk who did UG at Harvard and said it was unsupportive and cold.......jeez I wonder what they would think of Berkeley...and we don't complain.

Berkeley's not even ranked in the top 20 in USNews and trails in essentially every measure of undergraduate quality in comparison to the top 10 schools(HYPS, MIT, Penn, Duke, Caltech, Chicago and Columbia).

At the graduate level, people are only focusing on one area of study so I don't even see the point of considering "overall" graduate and professional strength. If Wisconsin is ranked higher than Berkeley in one thing and Berkeley is better than Wisco in every other area of study, then the person who is interested in that one thing should still go to Wisconsin. If I'm interested in attending law school, then why do I care what the top medical schools are or which universities are ranked higher in art history at the graduate level? People just focus on ONE THING after undergrad.

[quote]I don't believe there's any evidence to suggest Cal professors are any better than profs at any top private schools or LACs.[/quote]

You're right, there isn't. But there's no way to measure teaching quality. If there were, US News would be using it. So, what do you look at when you look at professors? Curriculum vitae, essentially. And most of Berkeley's professors are very accomplished, leaders in their field, who publish influential books and articles highly cited in journals and such. That's why Berkeley is known for its academic quality. Teaching? Hit or miss. The same as at any school.

By the way, for class sizes:

Berkeley: 62% under 20, 14% over 50
Harvard: 69% under 20, 11% over 50

Not very different.
[quote]When it comes to job placement in say Wall Street though, schools that don't have a lot of "academic cachet" like Dartmouth and Duke solidly destroy Berkeley in recruitment because of their overall prestige.[/quote]

I won't criticize your thought process there because you're a new poster, but the reason that Dartmouth and Duke "destroy" Berkeley is not because of their prestige (to recruiters, they hold no more prestige than Berkeley); it's because of their location. Wall Street is on the East Coast, as are Dartmouth and Duke.

Now let's look at Dartmouth's and Duke's placement into top companies in Silicon Valley. Guess what? Berkeley destroys them. And it probably does in LA, SF, and all over the West Coast. (One thing to note about Berkeley: it has maintained high-quality academics while also educating many people, a relation which is often negative correlated. Because of this, Berkeley's grads stretch its prestige, as they populate--if not dominate--academia, and high-paying companies as well. Berkeley's grads are everywhere in esteem.)

And recruiters don't favor MIT and Duke (for Wall Street, for example) over Berkeley grads. It's just that they apply less for positions in that region. Why go to the East Coast when there are plenty of opportunities where they are?
[quote]However, recruiters actively favor grads from HYPSM, Duke, Dartmouth, etc. over Berkeley grads.[/quote]

Want to give a source for that? In all my time on CC and many explorations of such recruiting, never have I heard such a claim made seriously. The general wisdom is that they do not "actively favor" those grads. And if they do, then companies in SV will favor Berkeley over grads from Duke, Dartmouth, HYP, etc.

Really, it's commonly known that it isn't your alma mater that gets you the job. In some cases, it might help you get an interview. However, it's the applicant qualifications--his experience, his knowledge, his skills--that get him the job.

That's true, but I don't think that's terribly common. I know quite a few who made about 100k and Harvard required them to pay more (this past year). Of course, finaid is a complicated business, so I'm willing to bet that it can vary a considerable amount for cases like these.

Notably, Harvard's initiatives have expanded the most for families making up to $180k. Even Stanford, even with its expanded financial aid, typically gives free tuition to those making up to $100k, meaning they have to pay for room/board, etc. (effectively making it cheaper than a UC).

The academic quality of undergraduate programs is typically close to their graduate programs. I haven't seen too many published undergraduate program rankings, but this is one of them (for Michigan engineering):

<a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/about/rankings.html" rel="nofollow">Michigan Engineering | Rankings</a>

Undergraduates are not taught by a separate faculty but by the same people (including graduate students for discussion sessions) who do the award-winning research that makes the graduate school of, e.g. Berkeley, so successful. As far as academics are concerned, Berkeley is ranked up there. What brings its overall undergrad ranking down a bit are things like class size, average SAT scores (it's a public university), and alumni giving.

Well, since UCB brilliantly recently concluded that SAT scores are NOT an accurate projection of future college success (honestly, what took us so long to see that??), your rant about higher SAT scores is pretty unfounded and ridiculous. Do you honestly think the top 25% of students (assuming that the top 25% are the most motivated, driven students at the school) at Hopkins, Chicago, Dartmouth, etc., are *that* much smarter than the top 25% at UCB, UCLA, Michigan, UNC, UVA, etc?

171.<<<S Luka Lawrence>>>
ya, harvard is maybe more known worldwide but berkeley offers much more

172.<<<Brown man1987>>>
[quote]That's correct, but that's not the very reason why I believe Stanford is superior to Berkeley as a whole, and Harvard is superior to Stanford, in general.

I agree to most of the posters here that undergrad is different from postgrad. However, since there's no specific data available that clearly separates the two academic levels, it is therefore imprudent to base our conclusion on mere assumption.

In other words, undergrad students at Berkeley are using the same facilities that the graduate students use. The undergads are handled by the same faculty that handle grad students. The teaching instructions are still rigid. The level of research is still top-class, and so on. The same can be said for the rest of great universities in American such as Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Caltech, Princeton, Columbia, Cornell, Chicago, Michigan, Northwestern and the like.

According to USNews, Berkeley's graduate engineering education is a solid top 3. When the same ranking institution assessed the undergrad, they came up with very similar finding  top 3. I, too, believe that there is little difference between postgrad school and undergrad school at Berkeley. In the same manner that I do believe that there is very little difference that separates undergrad quality from postgrad quality in other great universities such as at Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Caltech, Yale and Princeton.

Again, when it comes to academic quality, the HSMPY (or HYPSM) are the kings. Behind them are Caltech, UPenn, Berkeley, Columbia, Chicago, Cornell, JHU, Michigan and Northwestern. However, some of these schools (probably Berkeley, Cornell and Michigan) may not offer a convenient college environment as some of the schools in the top 25 (of the USNews Ranking) do. To some high school students, especially those who come from elite private high schools, schools that offer the better college environment is more desirable to choose than the schools that are more academic quality-oriented.

Thus, if youd ask me which between Berkeley and Duke would rank higher in USNews, I would answer Duke because USNews is a measure of convenience. In the same manner that Chicago would rank higher than Northwestern or WUSL would rank higher than Vanderbilt or Princeton would rank higher than MIT. But as to whether Duke has higher academic standards than Berkeley has, thats not likely going to be a yes. In the same manner that Princeton does not have a higher academic standard as MIT has or WUSL has got a higher academic standard than Vanderbilt has.[/quote]

I agree with you 110%.

173.<<<Brown man1987>>>
[quote]This is why strength of student body, class sizes, financial resources per student, faculty resources, advising and alumni giving. These are the best data points available to measure undergraduate focus.[/quote]

Counterexample:

Harvard has an incredibly strong student body, immense amount of resources per student, the best faculty resources in the world, and a high alumni giving rate. Many would say they have no undergraduate focus. Hence these characteristics don't necessarily measure undergraduate focus.

174.<<<Bescraze>>>
Yes, but Brownman most would argue that they are still the best undergraduate school in the nation. Thus is it really that relevant that the top professors may be predominantly taken up by grad students? Also Butchoky I agree with a lot of what you said, except I do not think a simple "academic quality" assessment is sufficient in determining, which schools are better than others. It is important, but not absolute. There is no question that Berkeley has contributed greatly through its research to our society, but as a prospective college student that really is not much of an incentive to attend a school. It is nice, but it in no way will change a college experience unless it translates into better job opportunities. I think you also make a good point about USNWR measuring convenience, but I also think you need to realize that this point only extends so far. I doubt you can argue that WUSTL is of a lesser academic quality than Vanderbilt, or that Princeton is less than MIT.....it is really a mix of everything that goes into the rankings. Thats why when rating colleges, much more than simply the strength of their academics have to be considered. Since, I think a lot of people would agree that in any of the top 50 schools the education you receive is nearly identical---the same things being taught in the same classes. So as a result other measurements come into play, such as the strength of the student body, financial resources of the school, prestige ect...

Most college students don't go on to pursue academic graduate study and instead go on to law, med and biz school or get a job right from graduation. Very few college students are intent on getting a PhD in a subject. So, it doesn't matter if a school like Berkeley has a better Chemistry, English, History, Cultural Anthropology or whatever than another top school because most kids who major in these subjects go on to pursue careers that have nothing to do with what they majored in content wise. Engineering is the exception to this. However, I doubt Berkeley engineering attracts more recruiters than Cornell Engineering. Companies will recruit from schools that have high-quality student bodies. They could care less or might not even know about how high the departments at these schools are ranked. Harvard Engineering might be bad but Google, Microsoft, Cisco, etc. will still pick up the Harvard kids because they know they are the cream of the crop and will adapt to the workplace challenges and excel in no time.

I'm not implying that the only thing that matters is a college's prestige though. The learning environment that colleges create for students is the biggest influence on their development and success during the college years. This is why strength of student body, class sizes, financial resources per student, faculty resources, advising and alumni giving. These are the best data points available to measure undergraduate focus. On a more secondary level, prestige and job placement are important as well. The higher recruitment of students from the top 10 schools into top financial firms and grad schools are a clear indication of the undergraduate prestige and prowess of these places. Connections are the most important factor in getting a job. The Ivies, Chicago, Duke, etc. provide these connections.

There is no objective measure that shows Berkeley to be better than any top 10 school.[/quote]

175.<<<rd31>>>
Harvard may not have a good "undergraduate focus" because it is so powerful in graduate departments (I know it sounds weird). The professors are so distinguished and absorbed in their research, that they perhaps don't have time to devote to undergrads. I've experienced the same thing with a noble laureate as one of my molecular biology professors (although I'm at a different institution).

[quote]Yes, but Brownman most would argue that they are still the best undergraduate school in the nation.[/quote]

Most prestigious? Yes. Best undergraduate school in the nation? Probably not.

Notice that proconsul claimed that a medium to measure undergraduate focus was measuring strength of student body, class sizes, financial resources per student, faculty resources, advising and alumni giving. I was simply refuting his claim, and I'm pretty sure I succeeded in doing so.

I would argue the best undergraduate school in the nation depends on fit. For me, it would have been either Yale or Princeton, because I would simply fit better there. For you, it may be Harvard because you are obsessed with prestige and selectivity. When you get to HYPSM level, they're all about equally good. There is no point drawing distinctions between them.

[quote]It has no impact on your experience there, your education, your job recruitment[/quote]

That alone shows how very little you know.

When there's lots of research going on, you can get involved in the research. That directly affects your experience--you surround yourself with elite intellectuals, creating new knowledge, in a new environment (often an expensive one, at that). Your education is obviously affected as well; you must master the subject of inquiry in order to find the answers to the questions still remaining in said subject. It may or may not affect job recruitment. It would help in grad school admissions.

I simply meant research is not that important, every school has it and has those opportunities. No one says you cannot have great professors, if you don't have a tremendous output of research (LACs anyone?), which is more focused on the math and sciences usually anyway. In other words, Michigan is not a better school than Williams or any other xyz school just because it has more research. This is mostly because its a gigantic state school like Berkeley. Its not all that important.....some kids want to do research, but overall it does not have the same effect as many other objective measurements. O and btw college is fun, the education is great and I think you grow as a person....yet I also think its impact on your future is extremely important.

193.<<<Bourne>>>
^^ Not so much.

194.<<<kyledavid80>>>
^^ I would say that Berkeley has many more resources. Its biggest problem is connecting the students to these resources; this inevitably happens with a university of its size. One way--the best one, probably--to help connect them is through advising, but it's exorbitantly expensive to staff a university so large in the way that, say, Dartmouth would be staffed. Because of that, students often aren't aware of the resources available to them, or they don't have the help to succeed in getting to them. That's why they always say that Berkeley doesn't "hold your hand"--you have to seek most things out on your own.

In short, the biggest problem that Berkeley's undergrad has (there are others, but they're minor) is guidance. Some, though, prefer that there not be too much "hand-holding."

195.<<<Bourne>>>
Haha, I don't think Berkeley has a proportionate amount of resources to accommodate much of its student body -- when compared to schools like Dartmouth. Advising is obviously a problem; I'd also assume that Berks students are more tiered achievement wise -- yet the fact remains that they can't proportionally match the opportunities available at schools like Dartmouth or Columbia.

To cover up the former with the latter explanation seems irresponsible.

197.<<<kyledavid80>>>
[quote]Otherwise, the "incredible resources" that Berkeley has to offer are for naught.[/quote]

No, they aren't. For one, Berkeley does manage to staff the university better than most universities--just not to the point where students are assigned ten different advisers. However, it is not mandatory for students to utilize their services; students can, however, seek them out to get a hold of the resources they want and need. For another, many other students are able to guide themselves to the resources without the help of a person--either through departmental literature, online resources, etc.
[quote]I don't think Berkeley has a proportionate amount of resources to accommodate much of its student body[/quote]

I don't think either you or I can really measure the resources available. Or anyone, for that matter.

Oh you meant, UG and grad?

Still makes little sense.

Of course it's anecdotal. I'm being a bit presumptuous by asserting the common "large public school" stereotypes... I still think most would agree with me.
[quote]"Tiered"? You could say the same of students at Stanford, even.[/quote]

Of course I could. I could say it about any school. The use here though, seems appropriate -- probably because the tiers would be a bit larger than the ones that would exist at the top privates.

Resources are spread thin at Columbia as well, similar to Berk. There are 20,000 grads at C, 5,000 UG at C. Opportunities at C are probably similar to opportunities at Berk, in terms of resources- unlike what you claimed. Dartmouth? Yes. Columbia? no. Columbia is the largest Ivy in terms of total population, and is very grad focused- similar to Berk in this manner.

I was just giving examples of Privates with big endowments + less students vs Berkeley.

And btw, Stanford has 20k UG + Grad. Harvard too -- Approx. Where the hell is the magic number?

Don't you think Columbia's grad programs are far better known than it's ugrad program? Columbia business school, Columbia Law, are a few that come to mind. If a school's graduate programs are reputed better than it's ugrad programs, it's probably safe to say it's a grad focused school.

Of course. While I'm sure you've never made an assertion without having a comprehensive factual understanding of the situation to support your views... I have. Educated guesses. I make them all the time -- in subjective matters where the prevalent opinion is prevalent for a reason...


No one is doubting Berkeley's excellence -- I'm just curious as to why you saw fit to equate the amount of resources per capita to a top Private -- i.e Dartmouth. And since you've so humbly agreed that neither of is well equipped to make a call like that...

So shall we always assume nothing until it can be proved through factual means? Especially topics like these where it's rather difficult to quantify "opportunities/resources available"? Or shall we make an "educated" guess based on a number of factors -- Large public, decent endowment(Compared to top privates)... -- and the "common stereotypes" that trail -- in this specific case -- Berkeley.

I'm sure you have an opinion. I'm also just as sure your opinion is based on your own anecdotal gatherings. Because you choose not to share it is no less noble than what I've done.

ok, i think that its common for people to take what comes easy for granted. yes, cal is much easier to get into than HYPSM. that's a given. therefore, the avg. sat's will be lower because more diverse (academically) people get in. but berkeley shouldn't be criticized for giving more students a chance to study at an internationally-recognized school. sure harvard is harvard, that'll continue for a long time to come. but harvard is also like 200-300 years older than berkeley, harvard has more opportunities for grads because of the amazing contacts an undergrad can get. give cal a break. as for trashing cal, calling it a school for losers or whatever it was, that's just pretty lame. i mean if those are the type of people who go to the so-called "elite schools" then i'm happy with my decision to go to cal. you'd be surprised to learn about some of the students that go there and their potential, i was. there are some amazing people that go to cal, people that are comparable to ivy-leaguers. its just that cal has more people than just these "ivy-leaguers". as for being in-state, i consider myself lucky for having such a solid public university system. even though i had the choice of going to some other, more "prestigious" institutions (for a whole lot more $$), i didn't just rule out cal because it was cheaper or it was easy for me to get in. is that such a bad thing? i wouldn't say so.

as for not getting as much in donations as these other school, none of the uc's give such a noticeable preference to legacies as other schools (where you can have upto 2x a better chance of getting in). wow, well thanks cal for giving me a fair shot

217.<<<cookiemon90>>>
i think the other thing is that at cal, you have to work really, really hard for something you want unlike harvard or other privates that will spoonfeed you the whole way (i concur with butchokoy). i would think that it prepares you better for whatever you might choose to pursue because the best students have to be truly amazing to be the best. academically, i would think that Harvard and Cal are comparable, but i can't say that for sure since i haven't attended both institutions. Cal's atmosphere weeds a whole lot of people out (such as the people who didn't get in anywhere more selective than Berkeley) and i think that whole experience is an education in itself

Brown Man if your going to assess Penn and Harvard as a total university (20k students)...then its only fair if you do that with Berkeley as well. Its not really fair or relevant for either, since the schools are fairly segregated and have independent resources.

235.<<<Phead128>>>
"Faculty caliber, research quality and facilities matter a LOT, LOT more at the graduate level."

It matters at the undergraduate levels too. At certain universities, and especially among the top 15, undergrads conduct a lot of research, and a significant portion have research experience. Most of the time, say if you are a premed, and you are associated with a respectable med school, its much easier for undergrads to get research positions at their medical school and get access to their top notch equipment and facult and staff than at their respective home campuses (which is no where near the quality of the graduate school facilities and etc, ie. equipement no where as new and cutting edge, equipment sometimes outdated, lab space not world class, etc..)

Therefore the link between graduate and undegraduate research quality and facilities cannot be cut. They are in fact very highly linked and intertwined.

You don't have to be a graduate student to take advantages of research jobs and research facilities, labs, and faculty researchers.

You have tons of chances to do that an undergrad as well. In fact, having a graduate program is definitely a plus since undergrads depending on the field they are in have an opportunity to connect and get exclusive research jobs that only undergrads at their respective school can only get.

Conclusion, Faculty Caliber, resaerch quality and facilities matter a lot at both the graduate and undergraudate levels.

I was just trying to refute Proconsul's point that Penn and Harvard can do a lot of "hand-holding" with their undergrads. They really can't because they're big. After you get past a certain size, it doesn't matter whether you have 20,000 students or 40,000 students- your university is big regardless and there won't be "hand-holding" as Proconsul claims.

237.<<<hawkette>>>
butch,
You do realize that the Payscale data does not adjust for the Cost of Living in various regions of the country, right? Obviously, this has large implications for the reported salary levels and unquestionably understates the "real earnings level" of colleges in the South and the Midwest.

I think any reasonable observer would agree that students from both Duke and UC Berkeley will have a wide variety of job options after graduation and that large numbers graduates of each go on to highly successful careers.

Carry on...:)

238.<<<hawkette>>>
butch,
My impression is that the schools with a large engineering component have an outsized benefit in the numbers for starting salaries and several schools that you wouldn't normally associate with the top ranks score very well (Worcester, Stevens Institute, etc). This effect moderates over time.

As for Duke, they do well at the beginning even with about a third of their students coming from the South. I think it is commonly accepted that Duke grads place well in high income areas like NYC, but it's not like the whole class is going to NYC. LOL. I would expect a meaningful percentage to stay in the lower wage South (25%?) or return to the Midwest (10%?), not to mention the mid-Atlantic area (20%?) and even the West (10%?). Statistically, this would likely lower their average starting salaries and their mid-career numbers.

And Dartmouth's wages are easy to understand. Virtually none of their grads stay in low-salary New Hampshire after graduation. I would expect a large majority (60%+?) to stay in the Northeast, mostly in NYC and Boston.

Finally, Notre Dame. Hey, I have long claimed that the school is hugely underappreciated on CC and much appreciated by employers. Despite having nearly 65% of their students coming from lower wage areas like the Midwest, South and Southwest, ND competes very well in this national comparison. Sort of makes that 3.9 PA score look pretty irrelevant and pretty out of touch with reality.

239.<<<DunninLA>>>
Hawkette -- I disagreee with your take on Notre Dame. High salaries are not evidence of a great undergraduate education.

I view these salaries as being correlated to the degree of "pre-professional" focus of the institution, combine with the % of engineering graduates.

Now, a person who *is* more interested in choosing a college more as a feeder to the interview room for business/engineering jobs right out of college would probably find a lot of value in that salary survey.

It seems in reading this board that a majority of the posters view the college experience to be primarily focused on acquiring skills and connections appropriate to getting interviewing slots for high paying jobs (a means to an end), and less as a time to shape critical thinking that prepares a person to make a difference in various life pursuits (academic, public service, business, etc.).

For the first question, yes without a doubt.
For the second question if you factor out engineering Penn is probably a better place for you, but since you really can't MIT would probably be superior. It is hard to tell, since MIT is a very focused school.

Also to answer your question, I do think these schools undeniably make up the top top schools in the nation.

241.<<<hawkette>>>
dunnin,
I agree with your characterization of ND and that goes to the value sets of the students. I also agree with your assessment of how many on CC, and probably most in the college application process, view positively the value of a survey like Payscale (while hopefully understanding the pitfalls therein). I know that this also probably pains you. And sorry as well to add to your pain as you surely know that I sympathize with the views of those who have a strong interest in the financial outcomes for students of various schools.

As for the relationship between the post-graduate financial outcome and a great undergraduate education, I don't automatically dismiss pre-professional programs as being lousy undergrad educations nor do I automatically assign a higher quality to the path you support. Just because someone is very interested in their post-graduate employment prospects does not have to translate into someone who can't also develop strong critical thinking skills and/or an interest in areas beyond the for profit world. I can see value in each, depending on the individual and his/her interests and needs. However, I think that those in either camp frequently don't assign equal value to the perspectives of their opposites. This is most evident in the USNWR rankings and their PA scores which certainly don't attempt to reflect the views and values of those interested in the for profit world.

Does that answer your question? You can't deliberate based on a single years worth of data. Stretch out your mind and broaden your senses.

243.<<<rocketDA>>>
You are obviously not a scientist/engineer. Just because you base your argument on the accruement of data from USNWR does not mean that any of it has any validity.

Nice thread resurrection. Care to explain your reasoning? I'm a prospective student for Cal and I've only heard that the academics there (at least for some subjects) are intensely challenging, with only a certain % of people allowed to get As in some classes.

Harvard and UC Berkeley are worlds apart, in my opinion. It's almost impossible to argue about any two colleges being better than the other (unless you solely count objective factors such as ranking or number of Nobel-winning alumnis), but simply because one college is objectively determined to be better than another (in this case probably Harvard, at least for certain undergraduate programs--but maybe Harvard is only 'better' because they're more selective and accept less students--who knows), that does not mean the college is more recommended for people to attend. One may wow employers with a Harvard degree over a Cal degree, but in a case where one would have been happier--and therefore a better learner--at Cal than Harvard (not because it's a better school, but the location, people, etc.), one would be more equipped to deal with what job he or she eventually lands (assuming that the job is related to his/her major).

Another thing is financial aid (then again, I skipped the last 17 pages, so maybe someone's already brought this up). If I got accepted into both Harvard and Cal, I'd go against everything I said in my last paragraph (even though I admire the proximity of Cambridge to Boston and other things about Harvard over Cal) because, given my family income, I wouldn't have to worry about undergraduate-school debts if I somehow magically got into HYP....very magically, as I'm not even applying to those schools. But that would be phenomenal.

Anyone from California? I don't know about east coast people, but talk to any high school student--random people in California, and they won't really put Berkeley up on a pedestal. So many countless people in our family and friends I'm acquainted with have gotten into Berkeley and many have turned it down to go elsewhere (As a subjective note, I don't recall seeing a lot of Facebook statuses saying "OMG I got Berkeley!" as opposed to "OMG I GOT HARVARD B!**CH").
Up in California, Berkeley doesn't seem to have the "prestige" and "high class look" as Stanford carries. Berkeley is kinda seen as the place to get drugs and "hippie-liberal sitters" or w/e.

My grandpa was the Dean of Veterinary Medicine at UC Davis for 29 years and was apart of other UC related things like the committee to pick the first chancellor of UC San Diego. Anyway, he actually said he didn't like Berkeley's undergraduate system and didn't recommend me to go there. Maybe he's a little bit biased, but take it for what it is. I'M NOT SAYING BERKELEY IS BAD, but it's just a person's opinion. We can sit here and argue prestige all day long, but it doesn't matter. Harvard will always win. But I will say to east coast people that on the west coast, places like Johns Hopkins aren't as well known, so just something to point out. What some random people you hang out with think of a university never seems to hurt or strengthen their programs too much. Since I haven't attended classes at either Harvard or Berkeley, I can't say which one is better. All I can do is go on a college rankings website and find that Harvard is better.

257.<<<Ambrosiana>>>
I look into academic and research rankings a lot about Top universities. Seriously, Berkeley's research is Absolutely Top 5 in this world. The only true competition Berkeley might have when it comes to the international rankings is Harvard. Not only ARWU ranks Berkeley Top 3 internationally, Times higher also ranks Berkeley's Academic and Research Top 5 almost in every field among different subjects.

In the USA universities like Duke and Dart could be a little more famous, but like I said, Berkeley is internationally much more famous than Duke in other countries and research institutions all over the world. Say, in China we all know Berkeley is ranked just 21 in the USA but when we look into its research and Nobel prize plus Turing and Fields Medal, which accounts to its real academic level, Berkeley beats every university in this world.

From an international perspective, Berkeley is always regarded a Top 10 all over the world while Duke and Dart are not. I must admit Duke is harder to get into and probably much better in undergraduate education, but most Top scholars like academy of science and engineering would go to Berkeley since there is where Real Academic is.

Finally I give my suggestion: for undergrad, pick Duke and Harvard. for grad, Berkeley is home to Top scholars in every field.
