[quote]I suspect RML's condescending contention is based on your refusal to ignore the objective facts placed before you that engineering students at Berkeley and MIT are statistically similar and insisting on continuing to apply subjective opinion (to which you are entitled) that Berkeley students are "much" weaker based on 'desirability' and personal observation.[/quote]

"Similar" and "much weaker" are both subjective, and I'm not sure if you're using "statistically" rigorously. Objectively, MIT students' scores are higher. Whether you consider the difference to be similar enough or rather large is up to you.
[quote]I find it interesting the need to compare MIT to Stanford despite the fact that according to the dubious US News rankings, they are one notch lower (#2) than MIT in undergraduate engineering program - nevermind that Berkeley is rated #3. By your reasoning, does Stanford students merit only 'lower' rather than 'much lower' assessment based on this ranking?[/quote]

US News is not my primary source for determining what I think of schools.
[quote]I shudder to think what you must think of Caltech students from the #4 ranked school.[/quote]

Compared to MIT, I think they are probably stronger in physics, chemistry, and maybe math, where I think MIT is stronger in engineering disciplines, biology, and humanities.

2.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
If we estimate the median SAT score of both schools by summing the averages of the 25th and 75th percentiles for each section: MIT's median is 2260 while Berkeley's is 2035. Given that the SAT is out of 2400 these hardly seem "statistically similar".

3.<<<lidusha>>>
Mmmmm but...I don't think that is how medians work.

@gravitas2 If a student were to get accepted to Berkeley's EECS program, they would NOT be choosing MIT over Cal, at least not if he were smart.

5.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
@lidusha I'm aware that it's only a estimate but I think it's a pretty reasonable one and to the extent it's systematically biased it should be biased for both schools. Why do you think it's a poor estimate?

6.<<<cadave>>>
@UMTYMP student Couple of things for you to consider in regard to your SAT scores.
1) They're for all undergraduate students and not Engineering students. I don't have the stats but Berkeley's engineering program is universally recognized as one of the top programs in the world and their students reflect this.
2) MIT has less than 4,500 students while Berkeley has 26,000. Which do you think is easier to boast higher average SAT scores?
3) MIT superscores SATs while Berkeley does not. Do you suppose that this may have some impact on the final numbers when one school cherry picks the best numbers while the other does not?
4) I suspect Berkeley students aren't losing any sleep if couple of MIT students think they're more than all that what's merited. They might get a good chuckle out of it though..
5) I think we can all agree that US News is not a good indicator. I mentioned it as a reference of 'objective' reasoning since there seems to be a void here. Of course what you bring up as your source of indicator is a mere popularity contest which seem to be perpetuated by your favorite news rag - which you claim to be not a fan of. Or was that @PiperXP?

7.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
1) Many of Berkeley's program are recognized as very good in terms of research yet the level of undergrads at Berkeley is not as high as other schools. I'm willing to believe engineering students at Berkeley are better than the average students at Berkeley but not by a huge margin unless someone has evidence showing this.
2)The claim is that the average student at Berkeley is much weaker which is perhaps largely to Berkeley admitting so many students.
3)I'm not sure that would affect individual SAT sections although I admit it's possible. I think the effects of superscoring are small compared to the difference in SAT scores between MIT and Berkeley though.
5)In what way are US News rankings 'objective'? I don't think US News is perpetrating the revealed preference rankings if that's what you're referring to. I'm aware that some people don't give much weight to revealed preferences although I think it does a good job of aggregating large amounts of information about schools weighted by what students actually making decisions deem important.

This is actually not what the data shows -- very few students choose UCB over MIT each year.

The year for which I have data, the number is actually 4. This is despite the very large number of California residents who are accepted to MIT each year -- I think it's safe to assume that many more than four students were accepted both to MIT and to UCB EECS. More students chose Michigan and Georgia Tech over MIT that year than chose UCB, and I have no reason to suspect that year's data was unusual.

"If a student were to get accepted to Berkeley's EECS program, they would NOT be choosing MIT over Cal, at least not if he were smart."

Cadave: why do you say this? My son got into Berkeley's EECS and is planning on turning it down for either MIT or Stanford. And we are in-state. (This is not a rhetorical question; I'm truly interested in why you think so.) Although I'm confident that the curriculum and employment recruitment is probably comparable at both schools, we think that the educational experience, enrichment opportunities, and ease of access to faculty/research, etc. will differ greatly due to the public vs. private nature of the schools.

12.<<<moshot>>>
@UMTYMP student ,
If sat is your yardstick,
at mit 25% score is = 670+740+680=2090
Ucb 75% score is = 720+770+750=2240
Mit students at 25% = 800*.75=600
Ucb stduent @ 75% = 4000 * .25 = 1000
So ucb has 1000 students having more than 2240 sat score
And mit has 600 students more than 2090
So, do your math and figure which has high sat score students

13.<<<moshot>>>
Calbearsmom, ucb and mit are both great universities but it all depends on how rich one is or how much aid one gets.

14.<<<PiperXP>>>
@moshot - Where on earth are you getting your stats from? I'm using the actual webpages for UCB and MIT.

<url>http://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats</url>
<url>http://admissions.berkeley.edu/studentprofile</url>

MIT 25% - 750+690+700 = 2140
UCB 25% - 660+630+640 = 1930

"So, do your math and figure which has high sat score students"

Also need to look at 25% of mit and 75% of ucb

16.<<<collegealum314>>>
^@moshot is comparing the bottom quartile of MIT (25%) with the top quartile of Berkeley (75%). I'm not sure what point he is trying to make.

Berkeley has more students overall (apparently 5X as many), so this is why they may have more students above a certain SAT score thresshold.

It's like saying China has better living conditions than the U.S. because they have more people making $50,000 a year. Well, China has more than a billiion people and the U.S. has 250 million, so that skews the results.

17.<<<PiperXP>>>
@moshot - Yeah, I don't see the point in comparing the bottom of MIT with the top of Berkeley. There's obviously overlap in SAT scores, but MIT SATs as a whole is still clearly well above Berkeley.

18.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
Another major fallacy in moshot's post is that the 25th/75th percentiles for composite scores is not the sum of the 25th/75th percentiles for each section. The 75th percentile of SAT scores at MIT is almost certainly less than 2380 and similarly I would expect the 25th percentile to be more than 2140 (using the more recent MIT admissions data). MIT also has considerably more than 800 students in each class.

The perhaps more serious problem with moshot's analysis is that given the revealed preference data it is pretty clear that there is something very different between MIT students with ~2100 SAT scores and Berkeley students with ~2100 SAT scores. MIT students with low SAT scores for MIT will have some distinguishing feature or they wouldn't be admitted.

19.<<<CalBearsMom>>>
"Calbearsmom, ucb and mit are both great universities but it all depends on how rich one is or how much aid one gets." Yes, I totally get this.

But cadave doesn't mention $$ at all in his/her assertion that "if a student were to get accepted to Berkeley's EECS program, they would NOT be choosing MIT over Cal, at least not if he were smart" -- so I assumed that he was referring to other non-financial reasons (especially since in-state vs. OOS wasn't addressed either).

20.<<<moshot>>>
@collegealum314, The idea is to compare the top 75% of MIT to top 25% of UCB. (not the bottom 25% as you mentioned)

@UMTYMP student.

Yes, you are 100% correct . For this purpose, 25 percentile (R+W+M) is usually lower than 25 percentile SAT score (vice versa at 75%) (I didn't mention it because not that many understand it). Also as you know CDS doesn't have total SAT 25 percentile.

Yes, I was wrong to say MIT has 800. I think it is more like 1000~1100. (Don't know why I remembered it as 800 but that is not the point).

1. The point is, by number (not percentage) UCB has more high caliber students when compared to MIT as measured by SAT yardstick. (1000 vs less than 750)

and majority of these high caliber students students go into UCB's College of Engineering which has about 850 students. As you know, UCB doesn't need to balance the student mix at each college level.

2. So, if you compare the caliber of the students in UCB's COE to MIT (which is primarily technology) UCB COE is similar to MIT, if not better. So, when you say "these hardly seem "statistically similar", it is very misleading at the best. (Actually I'll not be surprised if UCB COE is packed with more high caliber students than MIT but I don't have detailed statistics to support it).

Note: OPs question was about chemical engineering.

Yes but your argument that there are more students at Berkeley with SAT score >x than at MIT critically relies on this or some unspecified mapping of SAT section scores into composite scores. It strikes me as reasonably plausible that MIT's 25th percentile of composite SAT scores is higher than Berkeley's 75th percentile although there is a lack of actual data on this. Do you think that Caltech is a bad school because >250 students have good SAT scores simply by virtue of it being a small school? Why is the raw number of students with a given SAT score a good metric when (1) the percentage of such students is almost certainly more relevant and (2) it seems very likely that conditional on a given SAT score students at more selective universities will tend to be better.

I've already outlined some reasons why I think reasoning is suspect at best but I think the revealed preference enrollment data is even more conclusive. Almost no one admitted to one of HYPSM goes to Berkeley so for Berkeley's CoE to have better students would require an extremely large number of the best students to be shut out at the top schools. I hardly think admissions officers at top schools are infallible but this would require implausible levels of staggering incompetence among admissions officers at HYPSM.

Lastly, I've already mentioned this many times but I think general strength of the student body is more important that the strength of students in a major at the undergraduate level.

I have no problem believing that engineering students have higher math SAT scores, but they usually don't have higher verbal or writing scores. And I think their math/verbal scores tend to be more lopsided at state schools. USMTYP is correct that you can't add up the 25% of the subscores to get the 25% of the composite.

It is hard to find data to confirm or disprove this. But here are two data points:

VANDERBILT

At Vanderbilt for the class entering in 2013, the 25th percentiles were 700 for CR and 710 for M. The 75th percentiles were 780 and 790.

<url>https://virg.vanderbilt.edu/virgweb/CDSC.aspx?year=2013</url>

For the same Vandy entering class in engineering, the combined CR + M was 1470 at the 25th percentile, and 1600 at the 75th percentile. So at the 75th percentile, the engineers beat the rest of the students on both CR and M. Since the overall numbers also include the engineers, the overall numbers are greater than the scores of the non-engineers -- thus, the actual "superiority" of the engineers is greater than it appears from these numbers.

<url>http://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/about/statistics.php</url>

At a chat at the Vandy Engineering Open House several weeks, a faculty member commented that this year's (2014) entering engineering class had higher CR than M scores.


UCLA

Average SAT CR for admitted students in 2013 was 666.

<url>http://www.admissions.ucla.edu/Prospect/Adm_fr/Frosh_Prof13.htm</url>

For engineers, it was 680.

Assuming these data are correct so much for moshot's claims..

26.<<<geomom>>>
Here are MIT's mean math and verbal scores for enrolling freshman:

"Todays enrolling freshmen have the highest mean Math (769) and Verbal (723) SAT scores of any previous class."
from <url>http://web.mit.edu/future-report/TaskForceOnFutureOfMITEducation_PrelimReport.pdf</url>

However, the SAT scores of the entering freshman don't reflect on the rigor of the program, which was the original question. Average SATs just tell you about where students start, not where they finish. Nor do the preferences of the students reflect on rigor, as most students seek prestige and shy away from rigor.

Readers truly interested in the content of the actual majors should look at the vast amount of information about that online -- video lectures, syllabi, required courses, elective courses available, etc. -- for both schools.

(1) I reject your assertion that MIT emphasizes SATs more than UCB, and welcome you to try to back your assertion. The fact that UCB rejects many people with good scores means nothing when MIT does the same. You can read here about MIT's process:

29.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
[quote]However, the SAT scores of the entering freshman don't reflect on the rigor of the program, which was the original question.[/quote]

This is just ridiculous. Clearly the rigor of a program is not solely determined by SAT scores but I think there is a strong correlation between the strength of students at a school and the rigor of a curriculum. SAT scores are also a crude but still very meaningful proxy for the strength of students. Imagine we designed some measurement of the rigor of various colleges and regressed it against the college's average SAT scores. Does anyone think we would not find the coefficient on the average SAT scores to be large and positive?
[quote]Readers truly interested in the content of the actual majors should look at the vast amount of information about that online -- video lectures, syllabi, required courses, elective courses available, etc. -- for both schools.[/quote]

This is not a bad idea particularly for MIT where there is a lot of information on OCW and publicly available Stellar sites but it's also very hard for most high school students who lack the expertise to determine what is truly difficult and advanced. Is someone currently taking Calc BC really able to differentiate between a relatively difficult and relatively easy functional analysis class for example?

That being said from talking with one of my good friends at UC Berkeley I think the undergrad math classes there tend to be less advanced than the corresponding ones at MIT.

30.<<<moshot>>>
@LoveFrenchFood, Thank you for the info.

It looks the citation (Hout report) format has changed (now based on 'Read Score' ?), so not able to find the SAT score anymore. Assuming the scores are cited are correct (no reason to doubt it ) CAL COE against 2009 MIT scores (<url>http://web.mit.edu/ir/cds/2009/c.html</url>) are as follows:

25%	MIT	650	660	720	2030
CAL	620	630	710	1960

75%	MIT	760	760	800	2320
CAL	740	730	780	2250

Both at 25% and 75% CAL scores are less than MIT by 70 points.
It looks like even though significant portion of the CAL's top scorers flock to COE (when compared to non COE) it was not good enough to make COE SAT scores beat MIT scores.

So, I still think that
1) UCB COE is "similar" to MIT unlike UMTYMP's assertion (....2260 vs. 2035 (225) - "hardly seem "statistically similar")
2) By number (not percentage) more high caliber students are in CAL than MIT (going by SAT score)

31.<<<lidusha>>>
Why does it matter how MIT compares to UC Berkley? Both are excellent schools, and both will give you an excellent college education that will prepare you as best as you can be prepared for solving the many problems our generation is now facing. There's no shortage of problems to go around. We need as many educated people as possible with as wide a variety of perspectives and talents as possible. If that means any one school loses prestige, that's fine, so long as more people are getting educations that can help them approach their potential to do good in the world. If you are not satisfied with the academic rigor at either school (either because it is too much or because it is not enough), there are resources and opportunities to make your education your own. The important thing is that you are getting an education.

32.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
@moshot I think that is a reasonable argument although I'm not sure that 2009 MIT SAT scores are a better comparison than 2013 MIT SAT scores which are considerably higher (for each section the 25th/75th each increased by 30+ points other than math 75th percentile which was already 800). I don't think there is a good reason to expect that Berkeley's COE SAT scores increased by a similar amount over the last 4 years although there is obviously a lack of data. MIT's 75th percentiles have also reached a point where they basically can't get any higher so it's not clear what similar means in this context (is 2310/2400 similar to 2380/2400 when dealing with averages?) I also question whether the SAT scores of the COE as opposed to the general college are the relevant metric when examining the selectivity/prestige of a school but others may reasonably disagree. I also think there are strong arguments based on revealed preferences that the best students are almost entirely absent from Berkeley.
[quote]By number (not percentage) more high caliber students are in CAL than MIT (going by SAT score)[/quote]

Can you explain how you reached this conclusion? This does not immediately follow from any data you have presented so it seems it relies on some argument that maps SAT 25th/75th percentiles into composite schools and perhaps deals with both the averages for the entire school and the COE?

33.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
Stepping back a little bit from the details of this discussion I think it's important to remember that rigor is not the most important factor in choosing a college. I think MIT engineering is probably somewhat more rigorous than Berkeley engineering but I'm not sure this leads to more learning for most MIT students. I would guess that the best 20% of MIT students are significantly better than the best 20% at Berkeley and benefit from the additional rigor but it's not at all clear that a student who would be at the 50th percentile at MIT and the 75th percentile at Berkeley benefits from the added rigor. So unless you expect to be one of the better students at MIT I don't think the difference in rigor should be an important factor.

However, outside of the classroom I think MIT undergrad clearly dominates Berkeley undergrad. There are far more opportunities for MIT undergrads in terms of research and funding for all sorts of things is much easier to get at MIT than cash-strapped Berkeley. The signaling value of an MIT degree is also far greater. You can find a more extensive discussion of these issues elsewhere but I don't think anyone really disputes this although some emphasis that Berkeley has a more diverse undergrad population in many respects.

In the MIT admissions' experience, SATs aren't much of a differentiator after people have hit 700 or so. The vast majority of MIT students are past this point. This is not true of UCB.

36.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Hi all, I have edited and deleted a bunch of posts with personal attacks and discussion. Let's keep it to the argument at hand, please.

37.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
There are two main issues with using GPAs as a proxy for student body strength. The first is that high schools are heterogeneous and as such many colleges don't use GPA statistics (although I believe the UCs do). The second is that most top students and many non top students will have near perfect GPAs so it doesn't serve particularly well to separate out the best students.

38.<<<PiperXP>>>
SATs prove a very basic level of intelligence. MIT doesn't use SATs <i>beyond a certain point</i>, because past that point the SATs do not meaningfully predict how well a candidate will do. A large percentage of UCB students do not qualify.

You still haven't directly compared MIT students and UCB students in a meaningful way.

39.<<<GrudeMonk>>>
This thread is embarrassing. Piper, in general I love what you do on CC. You have helped many, including myself, in the MIT discussions. I hope you continue with that for a long time. But you've got to realize that you messed up this time.

I know that @molliebatmit has edited this discussion and it looks like she has removed the post that originally ignited the fire under @RML. When I first read that post about how you believe that UCB students are "much weaker" than MIT students I felt a jolt, a shock. I genuinely could not understand where that was coming from. It's so much at odds with how MIT Admissions people talk and how others from MIT here on CC give help to those seeking admission to MIT. From that point on I wanted this thread to die. Every time I noticed there were more posts on this discussion I felt a tinge of discomfort. I hoped the defense of the "much weaker" position would just go away.

I understood what @RML was trying to do by posting some shocking words about physical characteristics. I think it worked because it gave me a jolt or shock that was similar to what the "much weaker" post did initially. Still the defense of that embarrassing "much weaker" position did not go away.

My son won the lottery a few years ago and was accepted into MIT. MIT was his first choice and he would have been very disappointed not getting in. But if he hadn't he would have gone to UCB with his head held high. He got into other great schools, but for him UCB would have been the second best match. He is absolutely killing it at MIT and I am very proud of him. I know if he was at UCB he would be killing it there too and I would be just as proud of him. There are so many others like him who did not win the lottery and did end up going to UCB and the like. These are not "much weaker" students who deserve to be lumped into some category with your
generalization.

I remember reading another post of yours where you talked about your time applying to undergrad schools. You stated that you had always thought you would end up at a UC that you were definitely overqualified for. I can't psychoanalyze over the internet or otherwise, but there appears to be some sort of "thing" you have about the UCs. I don't get that feeling from any of your other posts. You show humility and helpfulness about everything else and I expect that to continue once this thread thankfully dies.

40.<<<molliebatmit>>>
It's not entirely clear to me why arguments on CC about properties of one group of students vis a vis another group tend to become about individual posters. This isn't the first time it's happened -- there was a thread several months ago (maybe a year ago now, by this point) about female applicants to MIT where a poster accused me, Piper, and Lydia of thinking that we were better than all sorts of people, because we said that many female applicants to MIT were stronger than male applicants.

I think it's a serious mistake to assume that when Piper says that MIT students, on average, are stronger academically than UCB students, that Piper means that she thinks she is academically stronger than every UCB student, or whatever thing people are assuming. I doubt, although I don't want to put words into her mouth, that Piper intends to talk about herself one way or another, nor does UMTMYP student, who has been making similar arguments.

Personally, I didn't find the original assertion -- that MIT students are, on average, academically stronger than UCB students as a whole (not limited to the college of engineering) -- particularly controversial. I'm perfectly happy to quibble about the meaning of the word "much", but I read it as a statement of statistical confidence, as in, "these two groups can be shown to be different at the statistical level." That also doesn't seem particularly controversial to me, but I wish we had better descriptive statistics of the populations in question.

EDIT: And, I should say, if I've affected the sense of the thread with my edits, I apologize, and I can try to reconstruct it a little better. I was trying to keep the flow of the argument while cutting out the personal attacks.

41.<<<nvruseaim>>>
@GrudeMonk - The post is on the first page, and it originated from UMTYMP student:
[quote]I think the amount of grade deflation at MIT is wildly overstated (the same is true of Caltech which has seen rapid grade inflation in recent years). Popular opinion seems to be that the average MIT GPA is ~4.2 but this is never supported with any sources. I think a reasonable estimate for the average GPA at MIT is between 4.3 and 4.4 based on the FSILG average (4.38 <url>http://tech.mit.edu/V134/N8/fsilg.html</url>), and this report <url>https://web.mit.edu/committees/cup/mit-only/P-NRandExp.pdf</url> (requires MIT certificates sorry) that gives the average MIT sophomore GPA as between 4.2 and 4.3 ~7 years ago so adjusting for inflation since then (observed in the FSILG GPA average and national trends) and the tendency of grades to increase as class year increases produces another estimate of 4.3-4.4. My guess is that grading at MIT is similar to grading at Princeton. Average GPAs at Berkeley are much lower but students are also much weaker so it's hard to compare MIT's grading with Berkeley's grading.[/quote]

That post was made to answer the original poster's question. That last statement could be perceived as an insult (unintended or not); I'm sure RML thought so as we see here:

<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">
<div class="QuoteText">Average GPAs at Berkeley are much lower but students are also much weaker so it's hard to compare MIT's grading with Berkeley's grading.[/quote]

OUCH!!! I think this a rather very condescending post.

Just how smart are the MIT students/alumni that they think so lowly of the Berkeley engineering students/alumni!!!</div>

Nobody likes to be belittled, so fine, that post is okay.

Piper's response:
[quote]^ It was a statement of fact. How would you say it in a less condescending way? Or, if you do not believe it is factually correct, what evidence do you have?[/quote]

I see what Piper is saying, but it could have been more sensitive I guess. As RML also stated previously:
[quote]I would admit that, in general, Berkeley students are weaker than MIT students. But much weaker??? Oh, come on![/quote]

However, RML proceeds to being insensitive despite his previous post.
[quote]That's a rather poor argument, dear. I thought everyone at MIT is a genius!!! lol...[/quote]

There are other instances that could be brought up, but that would just prolong my post. My point being this: neither side is blameless. I apologize if this post was a headache to read; I had no idea how else to format it.

42.<<<GrudeMonk>>>
@nvruseaim - Thanks for that correction. I apologize to Piper for crediting her with saying something that had come from UMTYMP student originally.

43.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
To be perfectly clear my statement was not intended as an insult nor do I think it should be reasonably taken as one. What it the set of schools whose students you would consider much weaker than MIT students? Unless the set is empty which seems absurd to me are you insulting the students at those schools?

44.<<<nvruseaim>>>
Sorry about that @UMTYMP student. I didn't mean to throw you under the bus like that with the previous post. It was an unintended consequence as I was responding to GrudeMonk.

45.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
I don't think it was throwing my under the bus by any stretch of the imagination as I think my initial comments on the strength of the Berkeley student body are correct.

46.<<<nvruseaim>>>
Okay. I believe we are all in consensus that, as RML stated, "in general, Berkeley students are weaker than MIT students." And this is not in a condescending manner.

[quote]Berkeley does not admit students on the basis of SATs alone.[/quote]

Neither does MIT. The SATs are still an initial higher bar.
[quote]Do you seriously think Berkeley is looking for geeks?[/quote]

Well, they accepted me, so ;)
[quote]You stated that you had always thought you would end up at a UC that you were definitely overqualified for. I can't psychoanalyze over the internet or otherwise, but there appears to be some sort of "thing" you have about the UCs.[/quote]

The UC system has guaranteed admission for top students in California, which I easily qualified for:
<url>http://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/freshman/california-residents/admissions-index/</url>

I'll be explicit: Berkeley was <i>not</i> the school I was referring to. You can probably find which school I was talking about in my history, but that's neither here nor there at this point. I did get into Berkeley (and all the UCs I applied to), and I think getting into Berkeley was much more likely for me than getting into MIT. MIT and UCB have different admissions processes and standards, and I do think MIT has the opportunity to select a student body that averages higher quality than UCB.

I don't think my points were invalid -- if you still think I messed up, I'd like to hear more. (PM is fine if you want to see this thread die :P)

I do think I was less polite than usual. I don't think I crossed a line - I was straightforward, I did not mince my words. It seems you saw the mix of theoretical and actual personal attacks before Mollie cleaned up the thread, and I'm surprised that what I said warrants criticism but those do not.
[quote]I think it's a serious mistake to assume that when Piper says that MIT students, on average, are stronger academically than UCB students, that Piper means that she thinks she is academically stronger than every UCB student, or whatever thing people are assuming. I doubt, although I don't want to put words into her mouth, that Piper intends to talk about herself one way or another, nor does UMTMYP student, who has been making similar arguments.[/quote]

Mollie's interpretation of what I mean is correct.
[quote]I see what Piper is saying, but it could have been more sensitive I guess.[/quote]

A fairly straightforward opinion was called condescending without any comment on substance. I'm confused why you thought my response was rude but RML's was "okay". I do not think UMTYMP student's statement was an insult.

I'm sorry, but is this referring to me? Regardless of who the target was, at least @RML please try to be respectful with your future posts? Your posts have not been very friendly.
[quote]Agreed. But I'd rather that it would have been phrased this way:

MIT students/grads, in general, are extremely talented people, based on some metrics related to logic, abstract thought, and even perhaps, memory. Berkeley eng'g students/grads, in general, are a little less so.[/quote]
I like the new wording at least. I believe it's a good alternative if it makes everyone here happy.

49.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
So imagine as a thought experiment that half of the undergrads at Berkeley's COE was transferred to MIT and half of the engineering undergrads at MIT were transferred to Berkeley's COE (I think these groups are of roughly equal size). Do you think there would be a difference in academic performance between the two groups at each school? I think SAT scores and revealed preferences suggest that on average MIT students would significantly outperform the Berkeley students in this thought experiment and on that basis I think it is fair to say that MIT students are much stronger academically. You may disagree that MIT students would significantly outperform Berkeley students in the thought experiment or you may think that this thought experiment does not justify my conclusion which is fine but I think this thought experiment is a reasonable definition of academically much stronger/weaker. RML, I'm curious as to your thoughts on this.

The point you are missing here, I think deliberately, is that nobody in this thread is talking about him/herself. Absolutely no one is saying that he or she is better than all, or most, or any Berkeley students -- just that MIT students, on average, are stronger.

52.<<<geomom>>>
I think you miss the point here, Molly. UMTYMP student and Piper would not be going on and on about being superior after being told that it was offensive unless they felt quite strongly about it personally. I agree with GrudeMonk, above; it is embarrassing.

53.<<<PiperXP>>>
@geomom - I think it's silly to not respond to someone's counterclaim merely because they say they find the original claim offensive. This thread has nothing to do with my own intelligence, just the average intelligence of MIT students vs. Berkeley students.

54.<<<PiperXP>>>
@RML - You misread. I'm saying that I am not comparing my intelligence to the UCB student body as a whole. I am comparing the MIT student body to the UCB student body as a whole.

Chatting on CC doesn't really qualify as fighting tooth-and-nail to me.

55.<<<PiperXP>>>
@RML - You cannot randomly take one person in a group and act as though they are representative of that group as a whole. That's just bad statistics.

56.<<<geomom>>>
Hmmm, you think it is "silly" to drop an unwinnable argument when it is clear that you are offending others. And indeed, I think the casual reader would find your tone in this thread off-putting, as well as the general p***ing match over who has the highest SAT scores.

Smart is as smart does, and MIT students are not representing themselves well in this thread.

57.<<<PiperXP>>>
Define "unwinnable"? I think RML never really had a leg to stand on, and I'm just rolling with the ****.

But yes, I'll stand by the idea that offending people, in itself, is not reason to change your actions.

Here is another data point. Take it for what it is worth. From my child's school this year, 10 kids were accepted to MIT and they are all going there. All 10 and 54 others (for a total of 64) from the school were accepted to UCB.

59.<<<lidusha>>>
That is quite a school you have there.

60.<<<moshot>>>
@Lidhusha

"Both are excellent schools". That is my whole point. BTW, You seem to be an exception in MIT :)

@CollegeAlum314

CAL COE has about 750 per year. That is why it is good to compare COE with MIT. It is obvious that the SAT score will get diluted when the school is large. For e.g. there is no meaning in comparing Caltech with UT Austin. If MIT has to choose 4500 students I am sure SAT score will get diluted. And that is the reason why Caltech scores are usually higher than MIT in spite of other disadvantages of being a very small school .

My first point was about CAL COE but the second point was about CAL as a whole.

@UMTYMP student

I am using 2009 CDS since CAL COE data available was for 2009.
"By number (not percentage) more high caliber students are in CAL than MIT (going by SAT score)" .

Yes, that is based on comparing the numbers derived from percentile. This can be done using ACT comp score also with the same result. BTW, the second point holds good not just for MIT for many other smaller universities like Stanford, Harvard etc.,.

Here is another point of view using the number of students who scored in the range 700~800 in SAT (from CDS data). I just chose 2009 CDS for no specific reason. Harvard didn't publish that info in 2009.

700~800
Cal MIT Stanford
................%.....no...... %....no....%....no.
Reading	33%	1320	57%	627	57%	912
Math	51%	2040	87%	957	67%	1072
Writing	38%	1520	57%	627	61%	976

If you look at %, yes MIT being a Technology school has an edge on MATH but Stanford has a slight edge on writing which is understandable. But if you look at the numbers CAL has a big advantage.

My point is private universities are mostly affordable for poor and rich students but there a lot of smart cost conscious middle class students who decide to go to public universities like CAL. (some get admissions to private universities and decide not to go, others are simply not 'special' for the private universities.

Note:
1. It'll be interesting to find how many MIT, Stanford, Caltech and CAL graduates go to each other for post graduate studies.
2. Hope prospective students don't get wrong impression about MIT based on some of the comments here. MIT is truly special JUST like other elite universities. . Hope it will stay the same.

61.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
If your point is that there exists some x such that Berkeley has more students with SAT scores > x than MIT had students that is (a) obvious and (b) proves nothing.

Elite private universities have generous enough financial aid to be cheaper than Berkeley for most families. Cross admit data also show that virtually no one is turning down Stanford or MIT for Berkeley contradicting your claim unless "some" means like 5 per year.

There isn't complete data on where people go to graduate school although individual schools may collect such data. For example according to MIT's graduating senior survey which got 788 responses (84% response rate) (so adjust by accordingly) 188 graduates were staying at MIT (presumably most for fifth year masters), 29 were going to Stanford, 26 to Harvard, 19 to Berkeley and less than 6 for every other school.

62.<<<mike011x>>>
I think that if you are going to argue that Berkeley students are on average "much weaker" than MIT students than you should clarify what you think the world "much" means.

According to Webster, much means a "large in amount or extent : not little" with synonyms including monumental and substantial. I think that if we do use SAT scores as a measuring stick (despite Collegeboard's revisions of it due to it's poor ability to measure college readiness) I don't think that we can say that the difference is substantial. If we compare it with the COE it is even more true. I think that it is ridiculous or even laughable for someone to think otherwise. Furthermore, preferences are also not a good measuring stick because it is in essence a popularity contest. Are some popular colleges good? Yes, and vice versa. I'm sure that if we wanted, we could come up with multiple subjective measurements of each school.

However, if we actually try to answer OP's question and compare to academic rigor of both schools, you'll find that they are virtually identical. Meaning that the difference between one or even three places when ranking several hundred schools is likely to be very small. If you look at ARWU, QS, or the Higher Times Ranking (all academic rankings) you'll see that this is the case. Sometimes each school is ranker higher than the other in different rankings and depending on whether you are looking at it overall or by subject.

Case in point: OP, the academic rigor of each school is so close that you won't find much of a difference. I don't think it should be the deciding factor of where you (or anyone reading this) should go to school. What should be is how you like the campus, the culture, and the student's there.

These rankings are generally based on the production of the graduate schools, and Berkeley's are comparable to MIT's. I see this mistake conflating the graduate school with the undergraduate school throughout this thread.

The academic rigor at MIT is likely to be higher than Berkeley just because of the nature of MIT's pedagogical philosophy. Caltech is the only undergrad school which may have even more than MIT. The rigor at Berkeley is probably top 5 in the country, and it's reputation is that the classes there are harder than Stanford's. So for some people, the rigor at MIT may be overkill. I have taken undergrad classes at other top 10 institutions (though not Berkeley); and there are noticeable differences in rigor. There are even noticeable differences in rigor between Harvard and MIT.

The absolute numbers are basically meaningless because Cal is a gigantic school. If you are going to make comments on the COE at Berkeley, you should use numbers from the COE.

Also 700 is a pretty low bar to use as the criterion for being a "top student."

65.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
Revealed preference rankings are almost certainly most the most theoretically justified rankings because they are based on actual decisions by people who have large incentives to get the decision right (the current state of data on this leaves something to be desired though). There is a reason why revealed preference rankings are published in top 5 economics journals (The Avery et al paper in QJE) while other rankings are done by for-profit magazines.

I'm pretty sure if you have trouble with any one of these you will fail at MIT and fail hard. Every single one of them is essential. I am certain that MIT admissions knows that, especially since some of the admissions officers went to school here.

Revealed preferences sometimes say something about the talent of the student body, but not always. Sometimes preferences are driven by a lack of rigor and relative grade inflation among other things. For people choosing between Caltech and Harvard, the grade deflation at Caltech as well as the extreme rigor may dissuade people from going to Caltech.

I'm not from California so I don't have a good feel for the people in the COE at Berkeley. I am aware that it does have a reputation for academic rigor. And certainly, it is a top destination for grad students or postdocs, on the level of MIT.
In the past, my impression that at a top engineering school like Berkeley, being a top student (top 5-10%) and having excellent scores (700+) would be necessary and sufficient to get in. For MIT, such stats would be necessary but not sufficient. However, in the past decade, Berkeley as well as most other schools have become harder to get into, but again, I would expect admissions results to become more difficult at both schools by an equal degree.

Someone described upthread how their high school had 10 people get into MIT with like 60 get into Berkeley. That was my experience with my own state flagship, which is not quite as renowned as Berkeley but has an extremely strong engineering department.

California does have a lot of talented people, but Berkeley draw from primarily one state with a minority from surrounding states. In comparison, MIT draws from a larger geographic pool. So I would expect the talent pool to be stronger as a result.

One thing I would be interested in would be the number of AIME qualifiers going to Berkeley COE vs. MIT and the number of people who took the AMC exam. Yes, I know not everybody takes it, but the exam has gotten big enough that a lot of the top math/science oriented people do take the exam. However, the brainpower needed to qualify for AIME is much more than is needed to get 800 on the math SAT.

Also, it sounds like @RML is foreign from his description of applying to "American" schools. It's quite clear that the standards for internationals are much higher than for the domestic pool. So the average international at Berkeley would have to be an extremely strong student.

69.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
It is true that revealed preference rankings reflect factors other than rigor. However, they serve as a proxy for the strength of the student body (it is theoretically possible that the stronger cross-admits would prefer college A to college B while among all cross-admits B is preferred to A but there seems to be little evidence for this). Certainly my impression is that as of 2014 most Caltech students are academically strong but didn't get other offers from top 5 schools as opposed to be really strong students who got offers from top 5 schools and choose Caltech*. Also side point Caltech has experienced rapid grade inflation in the past 5-10 years.

I don't think data on AIME qualifiers by school exists by a couple of years ago I looked at where class of 2012 high school students who got 7+ on the 2012 ARML (n=35) went to college and found about half go to MIT. From the MIT class of 2016 facebook group I estimated MIT got about ~25% of class of 2012 seniors who qualified for USAMO in their senior year (n=102). Putnam scores are also in line with these results. Obviously these thresholds are much higher than AIME qualification but they show that at the highest levels of mathematical ability there are many more such students at MIT than Berkeley.

*Caltech is a confusing case for revealed preferences. The Avery et al study conducted 10+ years put Caltech second while more recent data shows it losing cross-admits badly to MIT, not taking many students from Stanford, and ranked outside the top 5 in Parchment's rankings. I think the most likely explanation for this is (i) noise in the Avery study (n~3,000) and (ii) Caltech decreasing in desirability in the past ten years (also seen in admissions rate which used to be lower than MIT's and is now somewhat higher). I admit this is still a puzzling case as the rest of the data points points to a clear and consistent top 5 (HYPSM) in terms of revealed preferences.

70.<<<mike011x>>>
@UMTYMP student I don't think you're understanding why it is not a proper measuring stick for academic rigor. In your theoretical example, you state that "all" of the stronger candidates would choose the stronger school and not the weaker school. That does not reflect reality at all, the admitted applicant pool would never act in unison like that. But let's be frank, there are numerous reasons why a student would choose school A over school B, and vice versa. It is not uncommon (I can point to numerous instances on this board) where an individual would be deciding between a stronger and weaker school due to factors such as location, culture, etc and not automatically choose the weaker school.

Preferences are important for economic publishings because consumer preferences are VERY important to economics. However, it is well known and accepted that preference is not always indicative of superior quality. By saying that they have a large incentive to get the decision "right", what you are saying is that the right decision for them is based off of academic rigor, and little else. That does not reflect reality at all. If you truly think that cross-admit data is a indicator of academic rigor, I would suggest that you read up on how Princeton is reevaluating it's grade deflation policy (which produces a highly rigorous environment) due to decreasing yield rates, most notably to Yale.

Let's get to the point, can you provide clear evidence that shows that MIT students are substantially (much) stronger than Berkeley students? We've already agreed that they are on average stronger than their west coast peers. I think you keep on trying to prove what numerous people in this thread have already agreed to while spewing data that is irrelevant that you truly don't understand.

@collegealum314 Agreed. But I would like to note that state schools being what they are, tend to admit an overwhelming amount of students from their state. I think that this can explain why some schools have a large amount of students that admit Berkeley students compared to MIT. These schools are most likely CA schools, while schools outside CA probably have a very small number (if any) amount of admitted students at their individual schools. The undergraduate student body at Berkeley is also much large, more than 5 times the size.

71.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
I said nothing about all students acting in unison. If a group prefers college A to college B then most but not all students from the group will choose A over B. I agree there is substantial heterogeneity in individual preferences. That is why the dominance of MIT over Berkeley in getting cross-admits is so striking. The vast majority of students whose idiosyncratic preferences would favor Berkeley are choosing MIT. You also neglect the mechanism that more desirable to students leads to a stronger student body which leads to increased rigor. I don't think cross-admit data is a perfect indicator of academic rigor but I think it's (a) a decent proxy and (b) shows at the undergrad level MIT and Berkeley are not peer schools.

I think (i) the difference in SAT scores and (ii) that almost all students who get into a top 5 school don't choose Berkeley is pretty clear evidence that Berkeley students are substantially weaker. The math competition data I posted earlier also shows that in terms of math competition ability MIT has far more top students than Berkeley. Math competitions obviously aren't everything but they are a decent proxy for math ability.

72.<<<mike011x>>>
You did. When you referred to "strong cross-admits" you did not say "some" which means that you referred to them as a group. Now you're just saying non-sense for the sake of doing so. Please tell me how you took into account that Berkeley is a state school and how it heavily skews yield. The "analysis" (if you can even call it that) you presented from a one-sided point of view (does not taken into account Berkeley) is laughable to anyone who has taken a basic statistics course. Please present your analysis and demonstrate that a Facebook group meets a criteria for a statistically viable sample. If you truly think that that mechanism is so strong, please look at the grade deflation policy for Princeton that I have already mentioned and the controversial grade inflation at Harvard which even their own faculty members says is an indicator of insufficient academic rigor. I would think that Harvard has a highly desirable applicant pool and student body. Have you looked up any rankings by subjects for both schools? Or have you ignored them?

You think wrong. There is a difference in SAT scores but is it substantial? Please quantify what you believe is substantial. Even the Collegeboard agrees that SAT scores are an insufficient indicator of college readiness, yet you choose to ignore this repeatedly. No. And again, cross-admit data is a poor indicator of academic rigor for reasons that numerous people in this thread have stated time and time again. If you want to look at awards, you'll see that Berkeley alumni (alumni being degree holding) have won 30 Nobel prizes while MIT has won 30. I think that my data above is not only more accurate than data from a FB group, it is much more telling of capability than a math competition.

Using your logic, that cross-admit data is an indicator or sorts of academic rigor, according to Parchment, Pomona College and Harvey Mudd are more academic rigorous than U Chicago and Columbia.

73.<<<PiperXP>>>
[quote]When you referred to "strong cross-admits" you did not say "some" which means that you referred to them as a group.[/quote]

I think a reasonable human being can parse this as a statement about a group's trend rather than every single individual in a group.

Why don't you present evidence for your side?

74.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
Why does Berkeley being a state school heavily influence yield? I wasn't taking a sample from the Facebook group; I counted the number of such people in the Facebook group. This is an estimate because not all MIT students would be in the Facebook group and some admits who did not go to MIT may still have been in the group (I did this well after May 1st). I don't think rigor is just defined in difficult of earning grades. Harvard is not particularly grade inflated compared to peer schools despite popular conceptions.

There is a difference between comparing SAT scores of individuals and SAT scores of large groups. I think 100+ points is certainly a substantial difference when looking at groups and a difference of like 50-100 is borderline substantial when looking at groups. There is obviously much more noise when looking at individuals.

The Nobel data includes holders of graduate degrees. It is also based on people who attended those schools 30+ years ago. There is no reason to expect rankings to remain static over such long periods.

Regarding the Parchment data, I don't think the Parchment college rankings are executed particularly well even if they have a sound theoretical basis. The rankings are incredibly noisy year-to-year outside the very top (HYPSM have always been in the top 6 and composed the top 4) so it seems best to take a multi-year sample and to give little weight to small differences. Lastly, indicator does not mean draw large conclusions from small differences. Berkeley gets less than 5% of cross-admits from MIT while these schools seem roughly similar in terms of cross-admits. Also Harvery Mudd being more rigorous than Columbia or Chicago isn't that unreasonable.

75.<<<mike011x>>>
@PiperXP I think that it is reasonable to assume that when some says "that the stronger cross-admits would" that they are stating that if you are a stronger cross admit you will do X.

I have presented evidence and refuted your side. I think it is reasonable to assume that someone read someone else's posts in it's entirety before responding. No only have I shown evidence that shows why cross-admit data is not a good indicator (see my reference to Parchment), why SAT scores are not a good indicator of college readiness (as the College board themselves has said), evidence of preference and academic rigor with respect to the applicant pool by citing Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. You have failed to show that the difference is substantial or even to answer the simple question of what you believe is substantial.

The evidence that your side has shown is poor. If you are going to use cross-admit data to justify that an institution is substantially stronger, then you are saying that Harvey Mudd and Pomona College are much stronger than Columbia and U Chicago. Laughable. If you are going to use SAT data, you are going to have to go against the policy revision of the Collegeboard and how it is not a good indication of college readiness or future college performance. Additionally, you failed to quantify or show that the difference between the two with respect to SAT scores is substantial. Furthermore, the data that the poster I was responding to presented is laughable and statistically questionable. It is a "factual statement" as you say, that Noble prizes are are a substantially more rigorous test of the student body than a math competition.

This is all a repeat of what I've already posted. Try reading it first before responding. I am asking for evidence from your side because what you have presented so far is weak and questionable. So let me ask this of you, why don't you present evidence for your side that holds water?

I think that just looking from your post history you have a dislike of the UCs. However, regardless of your feelings I think you should look at the facts. This is not an attack on your character, but a legitimate observation and concern that has been brought up by other posters.

[quote]If you are going to use cross-admit data to justify that an institution is substantially stronger, then you are saying that Harvey Mudd and Pomona College are much stronger than Columbia and U Chicago. Laughable.[/quote]

It's not laughable. U. of Chicago is one of the schools I'd put up there as being in the top 5 in terms of rigor, but in my opinion Harvey Mudd is on par. My guess is that Harvey Mudd is more rigorous than Columbia. If I was to guess which two liberal arts colleges had the most difficult curriculum, it would be Swarthmore and Harvey Mudd.

Pomona is a pretty elite liberal arts college, and I know they get some pretty smart people, well beyond what is typical for Claremont Colleges, but I wouldn't say it is more rigorous than U. of Chicago.

I do think the liberal arts college element may throw off the interpretation of cross-admit preference.

If you look at the rankings and exclude LACs, you'll still see questionable findings if you use it as a measure of academic rigor. BYU would be more academically rigorous than Cornell or UCLA using that logic. Additionally, CMU is ranked below many other schools at #115, even a community college at #95. I don't think that the logic holds.

78.<<<PiperXP>>>
@mike011x - Claiming to have refuted something does not mean you successfully have done so, and you have not presented any positive evidence for your side. Unfortunately, we cannot get every application that's crossed MIT and UCB for the past few decades, so we make approximations based on available evidence. Show me something concrete that you believe is better than what we've offered.

Theories often have holes in them--in particular, there may be specific cases for which they aren't accurate because confounding factors may dominate. One of your examples is BYU, which someone doesn't apply to unless they are Mormon. Clearly, this may make the school preferred over some ivy leagues to those who apply.

You can't figure out what is going on simply through number crunching.

80.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
So let's be perfectly clear just because something (revealed preferences rankings) are an indicator of something else (academic rigor) does not mean that in all cases if college A is ranked higher than college B according it to the indicator it is more academically rigorous. Given that there are many indicators one would think this hardly needs explaining but clearly it does. This is particularly the case when the indicator is noisy like the Parchment rankings. For whatever reason the Parchment rankings are not particularly stable year-to-year and obviously we shouldn't draw too many conclusions from such noisy data. However, what is perfectly clear in the Parchment rankings, the Avery rankings, and looking at MIT and Stanford's internal data is that Berkeley gets almost no cross-admits against them. Because Berkeley loses so badly by this metric even if it is a decidedly imperfect one it is clear evidence on the strength of the student bodies. This is not absolutely conclusive evidence but gives it fits with other evidence we can be reasonably confident in our conclusions.

81.<<<mike011x>>>
@PiperXP I commend your ability to be so evasive. If you read my previous post, just a little bit you'll see what evidence I have presented and where I have shown evidence that supports my side and shows flaws in it. I will include it verbatim at the bottom of this post. Instead of avoiding my posts and constantly asking me to present evidence (which I have) which you ignore, why don't you try and defend yourself? Additionally, it would be useful if you could actually respond to the criticisms that I have.

@umtymp I'll let you ponder this, how would a cheaper large public university with policies that favor students from that state effect yield? You're using them as a sample, as a smaller group to reflect the larger student body of MIT. I think you need to review your statistics. Your data is weak and using it to make an estimate for such a certain claim makes me question your credibility. Furthermore, you say that MIT students have X amount of Y, while you do not specify Berkeley's. How can you measure something against something else without data for the other side? Again, refer to the reevaluation of the deflation polices of Princeton and how they have been lossing cross-admits to Yale in a substantial way. Is Princeton not a peer of Harvard?

If you look at percentile rankings for SAT scores you'll see that the difference is not significant, especially when you go higher. Even the difference between a score of 800 and 720 is a percentile difference of 4 points. I think that the average person would agree that the person in the 99th and 95th percentile are not significantly different in capability. Keep in mind that I'm using these numbers as an example, I am not saying that these percentile represent each school. But the logic is the same.

The scores and standards of a Berkeley student (like colleges overall) have increased in the past 30 years. If anything, this example would be even stronger due to the higher caliber of students today. But the point is, that we can look at many prestigious awards and see the same thing.

Now you're just refuting your own evidence. The cross-admit data is calculated to be statistically significant to 95%, you can refer to their website to verify. Their data is sound and I don't think that you can now turn around and say that cross-admit data is now flawed. I don't think you understand that how a debate works. The data is not only valid if it benefits you, especially when it is mathematically sound. They did not use theoretical data, they simply used cross-admit data. They are not saying that the have a theory that it is indicative of academic rigor like you are. And if you want to talk about "noise in the data" and how it changes from year to year, you should consider that you were just against any measurements that takes into account extended periods of time, such as Nobel prizes. It's as if you're arguing against yourself. The parchment data uses the most recent data. And the key word is substantial or "much".

"@PiperXP I think that it is reasonable to assume that when some says "that the stronger cross-admits would" that they are stating that if you are a stronger cross admit you will do X.

I have presented evidence and refuted your side. I think it is reasonable to assume that someone read someone else's posts in it's entirety before responding. No only have I shown evidence that shows why cross-admit data is not a good indicator (see my reference to Parchment), why SAT scores are not a good indicator of college readiness (as the College board themselves has said), evidence of preference and academic rigor with respect to the applicant pool by citing Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. You have failed to show that the difference is substantial or even to answer the simple question of what you believe is substantial.

The evidence that your side has shown is poor. If you are going to use cross-admit data to justify that an institution is substantially stronger, then you are saying that Harvey Mudd and Pomona College are much stronger than Columbia and U Chicago. Laughable. If you are going to use SAT data, you are going to have to go against the policy revision of the Collegeboard and how it is not a good indication of college readiness or future college performance. Additionally, you failed to quantify or show that the difference between the two with respect to SAT scores is substantial. Furthermore, the data that the poster I was responding to presented is laughable and statistically questionable. It is a "factual statement" as you say, that Noble prizes are are a substantially more rigorous test of the student body than a math competition.

This is all a repeat of what I've already posted. Try reading it first before responding. I am asking for evidence from your side because what you have presented so far is weak and questionable. So let me ask this of you, why don't you present evidence for your side that holds water?

I think that just looking from your post history you have a dislike of the UCs. However, regardless of your feelings I think you should look at the facts. This is not an attack on your character, but a legitimate observation and concern that has been brought up by other posters."

82.<<<mike011x>>>
@UMTYMP student That is obvious, and I think that you should read the portion of your post that I quoted where you clearly state so. If you didn't mean to say it, then don't. According to you, using any measurement that involves extended periods of time, such as Nobel prizes, are not valid and thus measurements with the most recent data should be used instead. Then you say that parchments data is not valid because it changes over the years due to it being updated every year with the most recent data. You are contradicting yourself and doing do only when it is in your favor. How is this reasonable? Then you go on to use parchments data after criticizing it. Wow.

However if you are going to say that the logic of using it holds because of the comparison of MIT to Berkeley in the ranking due to one being lower and one being higher, you would also be arguing that that assumption would hold for other examples. Otherwise your logic would not be valid. Using your logic, explain to me how Villanova U at #90 is more rigorous academically than CMU which is ranked at #115. Keep in mind that your argument that cross-admit data is that if school X has a higher cross-admit ranking, it is more academically rigorous.

83.<<<PiperXP>>>
@mike011x - You still don't have positive evidence for your side. This is a very simple request, but you are the one being evasive about it :)

85.<<<QuantMech>>>
I think that the cross-admit studies of preferences are not reliable, because a student must have applied to both X and Y in order have any possibility to contribute to the apparent preference for X or Y, via the cross-admit data.

Suppose for example that school H is hard to get into, and that it attracts a certain type of person. A person who prefers school H over any other school will almost certainly apply there, if the person has qualifications in the general range for admission. The person is likely to apply to a few other "top-level" schools as well (A, B, C . . . ). If the person is admitted by H, that person will probably pick H, which thus "wins" over A, B, C . . .

Then suppose that another student prefers A over H, and has H-level qualifications. Will that student apply to H? Perhaps on the East Coast, the answer is "yes," but in my area of the country, there is a reasonable chance that the student will not apply to H. So the student's preference for A over H is at least as strong as the H-preference of the hypothetical person in the previous paragraph (and probably stronger), but this person will never show up in a study of preferences by cross-admits.

I think that the reason that Caltech is not doing as well in the cross-admit standings (relying on a poster above for the validity of that) is this: At one time, it was the case that many Caltech applicants really, really wanted to go to Caltech. Recently, Caltech has gained a wider reputation as a school that will admit students with truly outstanding academic qualifications, with reasonable reliability. This contrasts with the admissions practices at many other "top" schools (for good or ill, depending on your point of view). So a student with outstanding academic qualifications who would consider Caltech, but would actually prefer H (or A, B, C . . . ) is probably more likely to apply to Caltech now than he/she would have been in the past.

86.<<<QuantMech>>>
With regard to the rigor of UC Berkeley vs. MIT, I think that it is essential to consider the curricular choices made by the students--and not simply the choice of major, but the specific course choices. In the natural sciences, there tends to be a very wide range of possible choices of courses in the undergrad program, as well as the option of taking grad courses. The level of rigor that a student encounters depends on the level of the other students in the classes that the student has chosen, and on the expectations of the professors teaching those classes. My university offers about 6,000 courses. There are some very easy routes to a degree, even within the physical sciences. There are also some very challenging routes to a degree. There might be less curricular flexibility in engineering, but I would guess that even there, some options are available that would make the degree more or less challenging. The minimal bar at MIT is probably higher than the minimal bar for the same curriculum at Berkeley. That doesn't say much about the choices of a really strong student, though.

87.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
So what QuantMech says is at least potentially a problem but (i) it seems unlikely to dramatically change the conclusion in the case of MIT v. Berkeley where Berkeley currently gets &lt;5% of cross-admits although it may make things somewhat less lopsided. (ii) In the Avery et al paper they asked students to list preferences for the colleges they were considering and constructed a ranking based on these preferences. The results didn't change that much. I think this increases our confidence that the revealed preference analysis is not extremely sensitive to these factors

88.<<<QuantMech>>>
@UMTYMP student, I think that the utility of the cross-admit data between any two universities depends a lot on which two universities are being compared, and the factors that go into the choices.

For some pairs of universities, I think that the "revealed preference" analysis is dominated by other factors than rigor, or quality, or prestige. For others, the "revealed preference" analysis is probably valid as an indicator of rigor, or quality, or prestige.

I recall the surprise of the Harvard authors of the original cross-admit study when they discovered that Caltech was #2 in cross-admit preferences--an outcome that was totally inexplicable to them. It was no surprise to me that Harvard "won." I think that the nature of the cross-admit study itself, coupled with the nature of Harvard and its applicants, pretty much guaranteed that. Oh, yeah, did I mention that the authors were affiliated with Harvard?

I wasn't commenting specifically on the cross-admit data for UC Berkeley vs. MIT. However, I am not at all surprised to learn that MIT swamps Berkeley in the cross-admit study, as you have mentioned. MIT has a lot of prestige among the general population, while Berkeley has less among the general population. That has got to sway a lot of the cross-admits. Financial aid at the two schools may factor into the choices.

My Berkeley/MIT comparison comments really address the relative rigor of the two schools. Some routes through Berkeley are more rigorous than some routes through MIT, and some are less. You can't really tell about the rigor of any given student's coursework without looking at the transcript, to see the choice of courses.

89.<<<Torveaux>>>
Stop trying to be so analytical (Hard for me to even say that based on my own tendencies..)

Choice of college among top schools is most often one of finances and personal preference, not rigor.

90.<<<QuantMech>>>
It does not change the scenario with regard to the H-preference student and the A-preference student, in my post above, if one adds comparisons of colleges that the applicants were "considering." The H-preference student is still considering A, while the A-preference student is not considering H. So the A-preference student still doesn't show up in cross-preference analysis. In other regions of the country, there may not be many student who act like the A-preference student I mentioned, but there are plenty around here.

I actually am quite surprised -- in the MIT data (at least for the year I did the data analysis), UMich and Georgia Tech get many more (~4x) MIT admits than Berkeley. Given that a greater percentage of the admit pool is from California than either Georgia or Michigan, I would expect Berkeley to peel off more students than it does, particularly among in-staters. Berkeley (25k undergrads) is about the same size as UMich (28k undergrads), but bigger than GT (15k undergrads).

Perhaps GT and UMich offer better financial aid for out-of-state students than UCB is offering? In terms of public universities with great engineering programs, my estimate would be that Berkeley has the "name" edge, which is why I find it puzzling.

92.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
I think GT and UMich might be cheaper for in-state students than Berkeley is for in-state for students. It seems plausible that Berkeley at 20k/year cheaper may get many fewer students than GT or UMich at 30-50k/year cheaper. Granted these would be different pools of students as well. There is also a fairly small number of students (like 12 v 3?) so noise may play a part too.

I will respond to the other posts when I get more time.

93.<<<PiperXP>>>
UCB is both cheaper tuition-wise and offers better financial aid (partially because, well, they do offer merit aid).

94.<<<QuantMech>>>
Fear of earthquakes? (which would not influence the UMich nor GT cross-admit results)
Incidentally, since you are here, molliebatmit, congratulations on completing your doctorate, and also on the NIH grant!

95.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Thanks, QM. The grant's from some time ago, though -- that post about it was very old! :) I'm now applying (and applying, and applying) for grants and postdoc fellowships in my new lab.

96.<<<QuantMech>>>
Good lucky with the new grant application, molliebatmit!

On a more serious note than the earthquakes comment, both UMich and GT have a very high level of prestige in their respective states. UMich, for example, seems to me to be more highly regarded within Michigan than Ohio State is in Ohio, or UW Madison in Wisconsin, or UIUC in Illinois--based on my observations in those states, anyway. Similarly for GT, from what I've heard. I don't know whether Berkeley enjoys the edge with the in-state high-school group that UMich and GT do.

Another factor that is somewhat different between the cases: UMich has an exceptionally strong engineering school, which outranks many of its other programs--e.g., the programs in the physical sciences are strong, but they are not nationally ranked as highly as the engineering programs. (I exclude the law school and medical school from this consideration.) GT is engineering focused. UC Berkeley has a strong College of Engineering, but I think that it has very comparably ranked programs in other areas. This might influence whether people think about any particular school as a "good school for engineers."

Then there are regional characteristics. Are "top" students in California somewhat more likely to go to the East Coast for college than are "top" students in Michigan or Georgia? I don't know, but this seems at least possible to me.

97.<<<QuantMech>>>
Aside to molliebatmit: I meant "good luck" with the new grant proposal. It's too late to edit the post. We have a dog named "Lucky" so I suppose I just went along a well-worn neural groove.

People have pointed to objective data that you haven't refuted, you claim to refute them, and you claim to have brought new objective data to light to prove your point when you have not.

As I said from the very beginning, "much" is subjective. Having a different opinion from yours is not the same as being condescending.

And now - until you actually bring up new data - I'll ignore you :)

99.<<<molliebatmit>>>
Thanks, QM. :) It's pretty ugly out there in the sciences right now, and I feel like we're throwing applications all over and not getting much in the way of money. At this rate, we're going to publish a paper on our project without ever having been able to convince funding agencies that the thing is possible in principle.

As for in-state prestige of UCB vs. UMich/GT, I totally agree. But given the sheer number of California residents who apply to (and are admitted to) MIT, relative to other states, I am still surprised. I guess the numbers might even out a bit if you consider much of the Midwest to be "in-state" for UMich (not based on cost of attendance, obviously, but based on something more like regional identity) and much of the South to be "in-state" for GT.

I'm from Ohio, and certainly it was a badge of pride for students from my high school to study engineering at Michigan, even if it was in Michigan, our ancient and deadly enemy.

To be fair, the word "significantly" doesn't say anything about the magnitude of a difference, just that the difference is statistically likely to be real.

Statistical significance is definitely too weak a standard in this case. With N approximately 1,000 a 10 point difference might be statistically significant yet I don't think a 10 or 20 point difference in average SAT scores could reasonably be considered significant.

Guyssss why do we need to have a pissing contest about this.

You can go to any school (any school!) and end up a happy, successful person who makes a big positive impact on the world. You can totally go to UC Berkeley and find yourself kicking ass and taking naps after (and even before!) you graduate, and you can totally do that if you go to MIT, too. You can even do that if you go to a school that is neither MIT nor UC Berkeley. It's way more important to find a place where you can fit in and be happy and have a support network so that you can take full advantage of the opportunities around you. That's why top schools care about "match."

And really, UC Berkeley and MIT are both top schools. Once you get to the top something or other, your future is as golden as can get, especially if you major in a technical field. You're probably not going to be hungry unless you are hungry on purpose, and you'll probably get to live in your very own house or apartment and send your offspring to nice schools and have a fulfilling and intellectually stimulating job.

104.<<<lidusha>>>
*kicking ass and taking names, not naps

I'm not even going to edit that out.

105.<<<PiperXP>>>
I agree with most of lidusha's post -- but I don't think that's a reason to not discuss rigor.

106.<<<QuantMech>>>
An opinion from a distance, but based on a reasonably good knowledge of academia:

It really depends on the course sequences that the student selects.

Average rigor of course work at Berkeley &lt; average rigor of course work at MIT (I'm pretty sure about this one.)
Average rigor of course work in engineering at Berkeley (probably) &lt; average rigor of course work at MIT, but by a significantly smaller margin than the average across all majors at UCB
Rigor of many possible course selections at Berkeley > rigor of possible course selections at MIT
Rigor of the most rigorous set of course selections at Berkeley (more or less) = rigor of the most rigorous set of course selections at MIT

The difference in the last category is that a student opting for the most rigorous set of course selections at Berkeley will rarely be in classes with his/her own age cohort--more likely, he/she will be with students 2-4 or more years older.

Then there is the question: What is the point of rigor in course work? If it's for bragging rights only, there is really no point in it. If it is sought to impress future employers, it makes some sense, but that's still a relatively weak justification.

I think that the point of rigor is to change how one's brain works. I believe that this really happens, if a student selects courses that are at the right level of challenge for the student: hard, but not overwhelmingly hard. That could be done either place. It probably takes better advising and more selectivity about the courses at UCB than at MIT, but it's certainly possible.

108.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
QuantMech, I don't think the option of taking grad classes solves the rigor difference. As I'm sure you know grad classes aren't just harder versions of undergraduate classes; they typically have a fundamentally different purpose. Undergrad classes typically provide considerably more motivation while grad classes often focus on being comprehensive and give little motivation. From both my own experience and talking with other people it's reasonably common for undergrads to take graduate classes and being able to follow all the technical details perfectly well but lose sight of the big picture. This may be better than taking technically very easy undergraduate classes but is certainly less preferable than taking a very technically rigorous undergraduate class on the subject that may be somewhat less comprehensive because it focuses on the motivation. I think you are much more likely to find technically rigorous undergrad classes at a place like MIT where many undergrads are very good and the student:faculty ratio is low enough to accommodate many such specialized classes.

If the above seems vague let me give a concrete example. This spring I took a graduate EECS class in convex optimization. The class required some real analysis and a decent amount of mathematical maturity as many homework problems were proofs. I think this is considerably beyond the technical level of most EECS undergrads at MIT although perhaps not of most math majors. I didn't know much optimization before but was interested in optimization so I took the class. The other students were graduate students who needed to use convex optimization in their research. As such the class spent a lot of time on very specific convex optimization algorithms and very little time on motivation for the subject. For the graduate students this made sense; they knew why convex optimization was important and cared about learning the best algorithms for whatever class of problem they were working on. For someone like me this is not ideal. I still don't really know why convex optimization is useful other than l-1 regularization in machine learning and knowledge of 10 convex optimization algorithms instead of like 5 convex optimization algorithms is not terribly important to me (different algorithms perform better or worse on different classes of problems).

I'm not sure you appreciate how math-heavy the undergraduate computer science program at MIT is....

110.<<<lidusha>>>
Sorry, scanned through your past posts and it seems that you're at MIT right now, at this very moment, as we speak. Are you 6-3? I feel like 6.046 is pretty darn proof heavy. Maybe I'm just bad at proofs?

111.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
I am indeed at MIT although I'm course 18. I haven't taken 6.046 but my impression is that while it requires proofs it does not require the level of mathematical maturity of say 18.100B/C which uses Rudin. Perhaps I'm underestimating course 6 majors but I'm not sure course 6 majors who aren't doubling in 18 would be able to do well in 18.100B/C which I think is more or less a prerequisite for doing well in 6.253. This may also just be my bias but I think doing proofs with epsilons and deltas require more sophistication than basic discrete math proofs. If you have had different experiences please share though.

112.<<<QuantMech>>>
Your perspective on graduate courses and their limitations is an interesting one, UMTYMP student.

Some graduate courses are essentially "special topics" courses for grad students who are doing research in a specific area. It looks as though the convex optimization course falls into that category. In many places, there are other types of graduate courses that would provide broader coverage, and some of the perspective that you felt was missing from that course. I don't know how the grad courses divide up at MIT and UCB, though. It is sometimes hard to tell from the title or brief description.

113.<<<lidusha>>>
My understanding is that 18.100 is pretty much the hardest thing ever, yes.

114.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
QuantMech, I do agree that some graduate courses provide broader coverage but I'd be surprised if many focused as much on providing intuition as advanced undergrad courses. Maybe the professors I've spoken to are anomalies but they often recommended taking undergrad classes even when students had the technical background to do well in grad classes.

115.<<<geomom>>>
Berkeley's Math H104 uses Rudin also, the same book used by 18.100 B/C. Is seems that Berkeley math students are able, quite like MIT math students, to learn the hardest thing ever. <url>http://math.berkeley.edu/~ogus/old/Math_H104/</url>

My impression is that for UMTYMP, and other students who are highly motivated to find rigor, there is plenty of opportunity at both MIT and Berkeley. For those students who are imagining that it is easy to avoid rigor at Berkeleys COE, and that somehow their C's or worse at MIT would have been equivalent to B's and A's at Berkeley, good luck with that.

116.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
Seems a bit strange to compare H104 which is the honors version to 18.100B/C. It seems Berkeley offers 12 sections of 104 every year and one section of H104 while MIT offers two sections of 18.100A, 18.100B, and 18.100C every year. 104 seems to usually use Ross and 18.100A uses Mattuck. It seems believable to me that Berkeley's honors classes are equivalent in rigor to MIT classes but that hardly proves the schools are equally rigorous. A further point is that 18.100 is far from the hardest thing ever; a large contingent of MIT freshmen skip out of it and took more advanced classes. I don't think the same is true at Berkeley.

Obviously it would be ridiculous to think C students at MIT are going to become excellent students at Berkeley but I do think for relatively good students at MIT (~20% of the class or so) the academic opportunities at MIT will be considerably better than at Berkeley.

117.<<<lidusha>>>
[quote]Obviously it would be ridiculous to think C students at MIT are going to become excellent students at Berkeley[/quote]
Really? There are classes here (*cough* 7.06 *cough*) that give you Cs for being AVERAGE. At MIT.

118.<<<UMTYMP student>>>
There may be rare classes at MIT where the grading is so harsh that a C is average but those are very much the exception. If you define a C student as gpa &lt;3.5/5 then their gpa is either close to a full point below the average gpa or more than a full point depending on the exact gpa. I would be quite surprised if more than 20% of the class had gpas that low. It's possible these students would be something like average students at Berkeley but I don't think the difference in abilities is such that someone in the bottom 20% of MIT academically to like the top 20% of Berkeley academically.

Gahhh I wish Mollie had shut down this thread. There is absolutely nothing productive to say here.

Shuttup I sold my soul for 4+ years of being kicked to the ground at another school and it was also really hard!

120.<<<lidusha>>>
There are a lot of things other than "abilities" that affect your ability to perform in classes. I know a few people with GPAs that low. Their abilities are fine. It's the depression that gets them. I would not be surprised if these kids would have gotten fantastic grades at almost any other school.

121.<<<lidusha>>>
Also, the average GPA at MIT at graduation is something like a 4.2. Definitely not a 4.5.

122.<<<geomom>>>
Lidusha, I think you bring up an excellent point. MIT tends to be really hard on those other intangibles that affect your ability to perform in class. And that makes it hard. This would be the subject of an entirely different thread about why you feel kicked to the ground, and why for many students it's the depression that gets them.

While you are felling kicked around, depressed, etc., classes are difficult. But they aren't difficult because of any extra rigor, they are hard because you can't use your abilities fully, as you said. It's like you are having to dig with a shovel and the happy person is digging with a back-hoe. However, just because you are working harder doesn't mean your ditch is deeper.

UMTYMP is eager to dig a hole right to the core of the earth, and I agree with him that he is more likely to find a few other friends that really want to dig deep (especially in math) at MIT than at Berkeley.

Is MIT really that depressing compared to other places?

I don't think 4.2 average GPA claim is accurate. Lots of people say that or something similar but the claim seems to arise from a 2008 tech article that said the average GPA for sophomores was 4.2. It's almost certainly the case that there has been some grade inflation since than and sophomores on average get lower GPAs so I don't think 4.2 is a good number for the average graduating GPA. I will write a post soon on this depth as well.

[quote]While you are felling kicked around, depressed, etc., classes are difficult. But they aren't difficult because of any extra rigor, they are hard because you can't use your abilities fully, as you said.[/quote]
That is not what I said. Not even a little. I absolutely disagree.
[quote]Is MIT really that depressing compared to other places?[/quote]
Good question. Another thing I never said is that MIT is particularly depressing compared to other places. What I did say is that from the people I know with low GPAs, all of them are very intelligent but not able to perform at their best because of depression.

The culture and grading also vary wildly by department. In my experience course 18 usually grades nicer than course 6, which usually grades nicer than course 7. In the classes I've taken course 18 has either set precise cutoffs from the outset or been like, hey math is cool let's talk about this cool math what are grades, course 6 is like, grades don't matter anyway because almost all of you are going into industry, eh, how bout that bell curve I guess, and course 7 is like, let's be honest here biology is a difficult life get ready for the real world suckerssssss.

But this has absolutely nothing to do with rigor.

127.<<<lidusha>>>
I don't think we should have grades at all. They absolutely do not measure what they are supposed to measure.

UMTMYP student's comment that one has to take Math H104 at Berkeley to have the same text as 18.100B/C at MIT is unsurprising. Berkeley serves a broader group of students. The top Berkeley math students take H104 (or they start beyond it). They might have a slightly larger class in H104 than in each of MIT's two sections of 18.100 B/C.

There might not be a "large" contingent at Berkeley who skip out of H104 (in parallel to MIT's "large" contingent who start beyond 18.100). However, I am quite certain that there are some who do. I think that 100% of the MIT admissions group will back up my statement that being quite advanced in mathematics is not sufficient to get a student into MIT. There are very advanced math students who wind up at other schools.

I think that there is an advantage for an undergraduate to be able to take math classes labeled as "undergraduate" rather than those labeled as "graduate" for the same level of rigor, because one is more likely to have one's own age-mates in the class. However, I am very confident that the top undergrad math students can go as deep into the subject at Berkeley as they can at MIT--they will just need to start grad courses sooner at Berkeley, in all likelihood.

I can't really comment on the development of mathematical intuition in the undergrad classes either place. I took math so long ago that the advanced undergrad math was pretty formal, and not that different from the grad math I took. Active efforts to develop intuition are better, I think--some books on that issue came as real revelations to me when I was a grad student.

If you are going to compare academic rigor on an individual basis, or in terms of what is possible, you really have to look at the *individual* transcripts, and not at the average level of student in any pair of colleges.

I think you're right about your second point, but I think it only really works for theoretical subjects because grad schools take classes seriously in math and physics (and probably engineering.) However, in non-theoretical subjects, the attitude is that you should just be in the lab, so the classes may not be well-done. It is highly variable. I think many top faculty may see a graduate class as an opporunity to mail it in and have a journal club discussion they don't have to prepare for.

130.<<<QuantMech>>>
Valuable point, collegealum314--I have seen that alternate approach to teaching grad courses. Math and theoretical physics do tend to teach *real* grad classes, as you say. Our engineers teach real grad classes.

[quote]Obviously it would be ridiculous to think C students at MIT are going to become excellent students at Berkeley[/quote]

It's not ridiculous, and I've taken at or taught undergrad classes at several top 10 universities (though not Berkeley).

132.<<<QuantMech>>>
I could conceive of some C students at MIT becoming excellent students at Berkeley, but by no means all of them. It depends a lot on the profile of the C student. Someone who is depressed at MIT might not be depressed at Berkeley, and that could make a significant difference.

The response of the student to challenging academics also makes a difference. I have encountered students who get 80-90% of the material up to a very high level, and other students who score 100% when the material is in the easy to moderately challenging range, but then have a very steep drop-off to near zero when the going gets tougher. I have encountered quite smart students who were trying to operate in an environment that was just a little too challenging and a little too fast-moving for them, and have thought that if the course work were just a little easier, they would be able to keep up, and so would acquire much better understanding overall. On an anecdotal basis with a sample size of 1, we had a C student from MIT who was admitted to the graduate program on an "exception" basis, and it did not work out. Perhaps he was too demoralized by MIT to regroup.

In any event, I think that it is uncommon for students to have a C equivalent average at MIT, so we are considering somewhat rare cases.

Out of curiosity, how much time did he take off between MIT and the grad program?

134.<<<QuantMech>>>
No time in between, PiperXP. He might not have recovered from MIT yet when he started.

I think I previously promised to reply to some arguments in this thread but then got busy with finals and forgot. If there are some points you still want me to respond to that I haven't please let me know.

There are a few things that set MIT (and Cal Tech) apart from schools like UC that are relevant to this issue. At MIT all students have to take 2 courses of Calc (not just any math), 2 courses in physics (not just any science), chem, and bio. And, there will not be any students in any of those classes who are not really great at math and science. There will be no students who are totally into humanities and are just taking those courses because they have to take them. There will be no legacies or students who hate math to round out the bottom of the distribution in STEM classes. All the students at MIT chose a college that requires 5 of the most rigorous courses offered by the university and all come on with outstanding credentials in math and science. Students at UC are not all outstanding math and science students. You'll find some students in the rigorous math/science classes who are not great at math or science but are taking the classes as part of pre-med. That would not happen at MIT because no matter how good a student is in the humanities, they have to be outstanding in math and science to get into MIT. That puts a new spin on the meaning of an average grade in a STEM class. When STEM classes include less strong students accepted because they are legacies or their parents have influence, or they aren't great in math and science but are taking some science for pre med, then it is far easier to find yourself on the top half of the class then if the class is filled with only students who are very strong in math and science. At UC-B English and history majors, often less strong in STEM, have to take one course in 7 specific areas so they may end up in Biology 1A or 1B with engineering students. Those students raise the averages of the strong STEM students at UC Berkeley but are not present at schools like MIT or CalTEch.

137.<<<QuantMech>>>
I took a look at the list of chemistry classes at UC Berkely, and I do not think that a MIT-caliber student who went to UC instead would be in classes with "students in the rigorous math/science classes who are not great at math or science but are taking the classes as part of pre-med."

The principal reason for this is that UC Berkeley, like many large schools, offers multiple levels of its classes, and pre-meds who are not particularly good at math and science will almost always opt for the easier/easiest option. For example, General Chemistry at Berkeley is offered in at least two forms, CHEM 1A/1B and the labs, vs. CHEM 4A/4B for majors in physical and biological sciences and engineering. Organic chemistry is offered in at least two forms, CHEM 3A/3B, and CHEM 112A/112B. The lower-level versions fully satisfy pre-med admissions requirements. The higher-level versions are parallel (but harder) courses, which do not require the lower-level courses as prerequisites. An MIT-caliber student would take the higher-level classes, almost certainly.

My own university offers 3 levels of organic chemistry for undergrads. Only pre-meds who are strong in the field take the highest level.

Physics and math usually run similarly at large universities. My university has 2 levels of physics, and about 6 different entry-level math courses, including beginning calculus as an entry-level course + many math options of higher level that are taken by entering freshmen.

There is really no such thing as a "level of rigor" of a large university as a whole. (It is possible that LAC's could be described as having a more uniform level of rigor--I don't know.) For a large university, the level of rigor needs to be determined transcript by transcript, depending on the course selection.

[quote]pre-meds who are not particularly good at math and science[/quote]
This keeps getting thrown around. I thought pre-meds were *exceptionally* good at life sciences, at least when it comes to doing well on exams? Like, the pre-meds are the kids setting the curve? And freaking out over Bs? Otherwise they wouldn't have the grades to be pre-meds? Maybe this is just at MIT? I'm so confused.

139.<<<QuantMech>>>
At other universities, there are pre-meds who are reasonably good at math and science, but not at the level that would make a math or science PhD program a good idea for them. It takes an unusual pre-med to decide to go to MIT to begin with.

140.<<<lidusha>>>
TIL.

141.<<<gravitas2>>>
agree with @QuantMech. That is why the true HARDCORE pre-meds (those who are devout future doctors) will rarely choose to attend MIT or Caltech for Stanford or Harvard...the latter two schools having a reputation for being more generous in awarding higher GPAs needed by pre-meds...

142.<<<lostaccount>>>
Right gravitas2. And isn't it sad that the admissions officers at med schools, business schools and law schools will pick the higher GPA over the more rigorous school. Wouldn't we want our physicians, finance consultants and lawyers to be the ones that went to the most rigorous schools, took the most rigorous classes/major and had the best education? Why are we advising students to take easy majors in easy schools to get into professional training programs. We should be advising admissions officers to overcome their cognitive biases and make better admissions decisions.

143.<<<QuantMech>>>
For the most part, I agree with you, lostaccount. I think that med schools in particular may miss out on some of the most promising future researchers in medicine, because of an over-emphasis on GPA. Science and engineering grad schools put less emphasis on GPA, and more on undergrad research experience and strength of curriculum--although the top places still tend to admit students with very high GPA's. It's just that a 4.0 (or 5.0 in the MIT version) is not really important for science or engineering grad school, but quite a few pre-meds (in my experience) seem focused on GPA maximization, and make risk-aversive course choices for that reason.
