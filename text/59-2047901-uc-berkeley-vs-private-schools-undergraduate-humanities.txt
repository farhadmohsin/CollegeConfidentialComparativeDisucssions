There are some lower cost LACs like University of Minnesota - Morris (about $23k billed costs for non-residents, though books, travel, and misc add a few thousand dollars extra), but they may not be high enough on the prestige (in philosophy) scale to give the best opportunity for PhD program admissions.

2.<<<MYOS1634>>>
No, you should not take on more than the federal loans as described above, regardless of the university.

Search CommonApp for colleges with a Jan 15 or Feb1 deadline that have merit scholarships.
I think that Carleton has a Jan 15 deadline but I don't think they have merit scholarships. Macalester and Grinnell may, look into it.

So it seems like the majority of people on here are very skeptical of Berkeley for undergraduate. Would anyone be willing to elaborate as to why?

Is there anyone who has attended UC Berkeley who feels this way? Or maybe someone who went to a private school and ended up in grad school with Berkeley alumns? Im just surprised because growing up in California UC Berkeley was always looked upon as a totally amazing school

4.<<<MYOS1634>>>
It IS a totally amazing school and the best and brightest CA students attend.
However humanities rely on small classes with discussions and lots of writing/rewriting, which is impossible in large settings. It's as if STEM majors had no lab... Humanities majors need to grapple with texts and ideas, ping pong them with classmates, writing lots of papers, drafting and redrafting several times a semester, guided by a professor.
In a large university setting, you'll have a discussion once a week with a TA in some cases, but many classes with 40-60 students don't have that set up yet are too large for a real discussion class (the ideal discussion class is 16-24 students, which is why many honors colleges cap their classes in that range.)
However that benefit is NOT worth debt beyond the federal loans.
So your job is to find a university that will offer the small seminar/discussion class format AND cost the same as UCB.
In the end, there's a way worse fate than attending UCB for undergrad. :)

I do not feel that way. However, you should note that UCB offers strong courses and curricula, delivered in an economy-class manner (e.g. large class sizes, though you should check on-line schedules to see what class sizes actually are for your major courses at each school, rather than making general assumptions*). For some students, that is perfectly fine.

But many posters on these forums prefer the LAC model, with small classes (even at the introductory level), though often at the cost of fewer course offerings or courses offered infrequently. The private LACs that are heavily favored by many posters here also tend to be expensive (some have good financial aid, some less so); some public LACs may be less expensive, but many of the LAC advocates rarely mention them (most of the public ones have low prestige value and low admission selectivity).

*Based on <url>http://classes.berkeley.edu/search/class/?f[0]=im_field_term_name:770&amp;amp;f[1]=im_field_subject_area:12</url> , it looks like lower level philosophy courses can be huge (hundreds), while upper level ones are often smaller (commonly around 45), each supplementing the typically 3 hours per week with faculty with 1 hour per week with a TA in discussion sections of around 15.

6.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^this would be compared to about 18 in lower level classes at a LAC, and probably 10-12 upper level. As you can imagine, the kind of attention you'd receive would be different.
However, it's not a choice between huge class sizes or debt. It's finding a college that will give you a good value for what you want.

7.<<<MattZ1>>>
Honestly larger class sizes are going to be characteristic of any university for lower division classes, regardless of it being UC Berkeley or an LAC.

8.<<<rickle1>>>
^^^That's just not true. Class sizes at schools like Richmond, Wake Forest and I imagine many LACs are small intro through advance (just smaller in advanced classes) Guess it depends on definition of small. S took 6 classes first semester at Wake and largest class was in the 20s (that included calculus which would have had several hundred at state U), smallest was 12. Very discussion based, The class with 12 rotated student led discussion (Professor assigned each student a date to lead the class in discussion - sort of a current event debate type format where the student leader had to have a command of the material and be able to get others to focus, dive deeper, stay on topic,etc.)

9.<<<rickle1>>>
I attended a large state flagship, albeit in the 80s and I realize many things have changed. I had the lectures with 500 kids and a TA led lab with a smaller number (maybe 40). Trust me, there is absolutely no comparison, none whatsoever, to the type of service, professor / student engagement, academic advisors, etc that S receives compared to what I had. Not better or worse, just different. Depends what's important to you.

10.<<<preppedparent>>>
I have a student at UCB and one at Pomona College. I think the education is great at both. One student does better in small classroom settings. The opportunities at both are enormous. At UCB, you have to be able to advocate for yourself. You have to be comfortable with large freshman classes, like 500 in an auditorium. Make sure you can see yourself at either before you accept an offer of admission. A small LAC if part of a consortium like Pomona or Amherst can give you the feeling of a bigger school.

11.<<<CollegeDad2020>>>
The chances that you become a tenured professor are between slim and none. Getting into a top notch graduate school gets you through one filter but there are not nearly enough tenure track positions for all the graduate students graduating from top notch graduate schools, let alone all graduate schools. Becoming a tenured professor is not a career path any more than becoming a professional athlete is one.

If you or your family need to borrow money to chase this dream, re-think your plans right now. If, on the other hand, the cost of education is not a big deal, feel free to chase your dream and enjoy the experience. After all leisure is the basis of culture.

12.<<<STEMteacher>>>
Berkeley is the Dr. Pepper of universities . . . you will either like it or you won't. It's the only place I've ever seen a wild squirrel with an earring. With its large stone buildings and its general weirdness, it can also be a very lonely place. It is very high energy and exciting, too. Be sure to visit first before committing. It definitely isn't for everyone.

13.<<<hbrunner>>>
Berkeley is what you make of it. I'm a first year humanities student and I haven't found it overwhelming, but know lots of people that have. The difference between Cal and a LAC is they will not hold your hand at Cal. You can have great access to professors, most of which are top in the field, but you have to put in the effort by going to office hours, talking to them after class, and actively participating in class. As far as class size, it varies dramatically class to class and major to major. Assume that most of your intro classes will be large and with upper division class size greatly reduced. There are opportunities for small classes in your first two years though (I've taken 2 semesters of Spanish with less than 20 people and 2 freshman seminars each with 15 people). All lecture classes have discussion sections led by Grad students that tend to have between 20-30 people in them. Like with getting to know your professors, it is on you to get involved on campus. I too came from a big high school so this wasn't a problem and I love everything I've gotten involved with. A lot of the social scene comes from clubs. I turned down many LAC to come to Cal and am very glad that I did. While Berkeley is a perfect fit for me, I would not recommend it to people that lack self direction.

14.<<<preppedparent>>>
You can't do better than Cal with its stellar reputation and great education. No comparison between Cal and say Kenyon or Holy Cross.

15.<<<lfrancis95>>>
Its always interesting to read comments about UCB since they usually are diametrically opposes fo one another. Prospective students must be incredibly confused. I understand why this is the case because my son just graduated from UCB. He worked harder than Ive ever seen a student work, but finished with an amazing education and great job prospects. Highly motivated, self directed students thrive at UCB. Students who need more support are better off going to a private college. Based on your description, you sound like you will do well at UCB without breaking the bank.

16.<<<Undercrackers>>>
@lfrancis95 I think you summed it up perfectly. My sophomore D - always academically driven - is doing very well as a STEM major at an extremely tough university. Working her tail off, but then she did that in high school, too. She's figuring out how to get what she needs from a large university with a lot of resources but not a lot of hand holding. Club director, undergraduate research, and a paid summer internship: not too shabby for a kid from a mid-level public high school.

17.<<<LittleBear83>>>
The class sizes really vary a lot by major. Philosophy is one of the larger Humanities majors, and has a mix of some classes that are around 15-20, and some that get up to 100. English is the same. But a lot of majors have much smaller classes - based on the interests you mentioned, I'd suggest considering Classics or Comparative Literature. The language programs are also really small, and once you get to the upper-division levels, you're basically studying literature but just in another language.

As someone else mentioned, you do have to make the effort to get to know your professors but they will be more than happy to help you. They love students who are passionate about their subject and want to go into academia. Also, you can take freshman seminars starting your first semester, and they're capped at 15 students, I think.

18.<<<bigfandave>>>
Im sorry....no way UCB isnt better than the best LACs? Youve just lost all credibility. UCB for Grad School makes much more sense. And what is the best way to get into UCB Grad School? Yes, a small LAC where you can manage your GPA, taught 90-99% by tenured Professors, not 23 year-old TAs.

19.<<<bigfandave>>>
@preppedparent perhaps you are unaware of all the kids at UCB taking classes in SF or living at Mills College due to lack of room and Professors? When classes hit 200 for lower levels, it gets a bit discouraging and can be a challenge to remain engaged when you are sitting in the hallway or lobby outside the lecture halll due to lack of physical space.

20.<<<preppedparent>>>
^^That doesn't sound good. Luckily my student never lived at Mills College or took classes off campus. The furthese was Clark Kerr Campus. Berkeley is what you make of it...you can't be afraid of a monster sized university and you have to make your luck and your connections.

21.<<<bigfandave>>>
@preppedparent totally agree with its what one makes of it, and the bit of nuance is at an LAC, that is laid out for students and they dont have to work so hard on soft skills like networking, swimming instead of sinking, proactive advising, TAs that dont get it and fight the system, so to speak, like ours have had to do all through CA public schools. Thats in part why its such a terrific grad school option, as is UCLA. Best of both world would be USC in CA to a degree.

22.<<<ucbalumnus>>>

USC seems more like a private version of a big state university, with the usual pluses and minuses of such, than a LAC.

23.<<<bigfandave>>>
Actually no. USC probably has the best business network in the nation. You wont find that level of committed, helpful alums and donors at any state school. More like a big LAC with a pre-professional bent. You get your classes, quality advising, etc. Yes, its large but so well-endowed, nothing is at a shortfall.

24.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Most LACs do not have introductory-level class sizes anywhere near as large as those at USC (e.g. 200+ for introductory biology and chemistry; small class sizes, even at the introductory level, appear to be the main selling point of LACs). LACs also tend to be less pre-professional.

USC has its own pros and cons, but it really is not really a LAC.

25.<<<TiggerDad>>>
To OP, attending a LAC is too much of financial strain on his family. I don't see what the worry is. Cal-Berkeley's philosophy dept is one of the top in the nation if not the best. The upper courses beyond the introductory tend to be more like seminars in terms of the number of students. For philosophy, the size of class doesn't matter as much. OP has no problem in a huge environment, anyway.

26.<<<smsk>>>
People claiming Philosophy (esp. at Berkeley) is "easy" don't have a clue. One of the smartest professors I know graduated with a BA in Philosophy and went on to pursue a PhD in EECS. I took Philos 12A and Discrete Math, and I would love to take Philos 140b (Intermediate logic) if I can convince myself that I'm capable of passing that class :P

27.<<<ProfessorPlum168>>>
My kid is taking a Philosophy breath class CLASSICS 10A Greek Civilization and its a really intense class with tons of reading and abstract thinking. The class is taught by a renowned professor. Discussion sections which are no more than 25 people are led by younger TAs who are most likely grad students.

28.<<<smsk>>>
@ProfessorPlum168 I think your kid would do really well in Philosophy 12A (it fulfills the Philosophy requirement for Cog. Sci.)

29.<<<monroe115>>>
I want to major in something in the humanities, most likely philosophy or comp lit. Here's the deal:

30.<<<monroe115>>>
Note: I do really well in large environments (high school was 3000 kids). While the small class size at a private school would probably be pretty cool, I have no problem speaking up, asking questions, being assertive, talking to my teachers and doing whatever I have to do. I am very motivated.

31.<<<mommyrocks>>>
UC Berkeley is extremely highly regarded. There is no way that going to an LAC could be seen as better, or could open more doors for you into grad school or jobs. UC Berkeley is by far your better choice. That $200,000 debt would be your parents, not yours, since students are limited in how much money they can borrow for undergraduate degrees ($5,500-$7,500 a year max). It's absurd to even think of having your parents do that. You are listening to people who have not done the research on who actually gets into graduate programs in philosophy. That information is often on the internet if you care to look it up.

Below are the colleges that current Philosophy graduate students at Berkeley attended for their bachelor's degrees. Note that Reed College and Boston College are not even on the list. Berkeley IS on the list. While there are some LACs represented, the majority of students went to much larger universities for their undergraduate degrees, ranging from state flagship universities to Ivies.

<url>https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/people/graduate_students</url>

U Penn, Harvard, U Toronto, HU Berlin, U Cincinnati, Yale, UNC, Berkeley, NYU, Hebrew U, Biola U, NYU, McGill, Stanford, Middlebury, SUNY Geneseo, U Toronto, Haverford, U Chicago, Williams, University College London, Oberlin, Indiana U, Oxford, Notre Dame, U Chicago, Cambridge, U Toronto, U Penn, Johns Hopkins, Freie Universitat Berlin, Sarah Lawrence College, NYU, Harvard, McGill, Arizona State, Rutgers, McGill, Harvard, Ludwig-Maximilians-U Munich, University College London, Brown

The online background information for grad students in Philosophy at Princeton and Stanford was incomplete, but some of the universities attended by those students for their bachelor's degrees are shown below, with Berkeley represented at both places, Reed only at one place, and Boston College at neither place. Whoever is telling you that Reed or Boston College will do more for you than Berkeley is misinformed.

<url>https://philosophy.princeton.edu/people/graduate-students</url>

U Toronto, Cambridge, U Chicago, U Montana, Berkeley, Reed, Stanford, Cambridge, Duke, Brown, Haverford, Oxford, St. Olaf, William &amp; Mary, Universidad de los Andes, Brown, Cornell, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Oxford, Franklin &amp; Marshall, Biola, National Institute of Technology India, Wayne State U

<url>https://philosophy.stanford.edu/people/graduate-students</url>

Oxford, U Auckland, Oxford, U Chicago, Berkeley, Princeton, U Toronto, U Auckland, Carleton, Tel Aviv U, Emory, U Edinburgh, UNC

Note that at all these graduate programs, many students come from abroad -- some of your biggest competition getting into a PhD program later will be global and not students from LACs.

32.<<<monroe115>>>
@mommyrocks

Thank you so much for all the information and for the detailed response. I was pretty sure on Berkeley, but when I began reading a lot on this website I started to get a little anxious about what to do. Now I'm really confident about Berkeley. Thanks.

33.<<<fivesages>>>
There is no doubt that small, liberal arts schools provide better support and results when it comes to placing students into the top PhD programs. Just research about PhD feeder schools. It is not even close. While Berkeley is a great school, it is large, very competitive and lacks the support services. Thriving-in/liking 3000 high school environment is not same as UC Berkley, especially at the undergraduate level. Also, while Berkeley is cheaper, for in-state, it is not cheap...costs $30-35K per year. Of course, I wouldn't go to any LAC on full debt. Let me suggest an alternative...find a LAC that may give you some type of aid. Many LACs offer merit aid to attract top students, especially those who have the profile to get into schools like Berkeley.

Don't get me wrong, Berkeley has the brand and strong job placement for STEM/quant-oriented/business-oriented students.

Edit: BTW, @mommyrocks provided some real good info. You may want to reach out to some of the Berkeley graduates on those lists and ask them. Most of them list email, and will be happy to help.

Philosophy is generally considered a more intellectually difficult major because it is a humanities major that also requires logical thinking (i.e. the kind of thinking usually associated with math) in addition to the usual humanities thinking. Many people are strong in one but less so in the other, so they may find philosophy more difficult.
[quote]<a rel="nofollow" href="/profile/monroe115">monroe115</a> wrote:[/quote]

$200,000 debt is generally considered far too much for any undergraduate school. Most of it will need to be parent loans or parent cosigned loans, so if your parents cannot afford to pay from savings and current income, taking on that amount of debt is a bad idea for them as well as you.

Although if Reed would need $200,000 in debt (probably means parent contribution of $70,000 or so total), in-state UC may also be a financial stretch unless you can live at home and commute, or possibly if you live very cheaply, like in the BSC co-op houses.

Be aware that this is kind of an elite-or-bust path.

Tenure-track faculty jobs are rare compared to the number of PhD graduates. Hence, any opening tends to attract hundreds of applicants with stellar academic accomplishments. It is particularly competitive in subjects where there is not much major-specific non-academic job demand (e.g. engineering and CS PhD graduates can often go to industry, while philosophy graduates have fewer industry options). Faculty hiring also tends to favor PhD school prestige in major, so you need to go to PhD school that is top ranked in major. And philosophy is supposedly one of those subjects where PhD program admissions are more sensitive to the prestige in major of your undergraduate school (though there is much less transparency on what undergraduate schools they like, particularly with LACs).

It is no surprise that some of the more disgruntled faculty writings come from humanities faculty (e.g. Jacques Berlinerblau's <i>Campus Confidential</i>, William Deresiewicz' <i>Excellent Sheep</i>).

At the bachelor's level <url>http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/info-Degrees_that_Pay_you_Back-sort.html</url> suggests that philosophy is a major with a wide distribution of mid-career pay results -- the 90th percentile does very well, but the 10th percentile does poorly (the median does well also).

36.<<<monroe115>>>
[quote]in-state UC may also be a financial stretch unless you can live at home and commute[/quote]

I guess I exaggerated a bit, we would be able to cover most of the in-state tuition, and I forgot to mention I have some family near Berkeley so I could probably rent way cheaper than average.

So, realistically it would probably be UC Berkeley with minor debt if any debt at all, versus realistically say like 100K for a private school.

37.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
$100,000 in debt is still far too much for undergraduate, and would require parent loans or cosigned loans.

Also, do you have safeties that you are certain of both admission and affordability?

38.<<<monroe115>>>
@ucbalumnus

I did apply to a couple CSU schools and most of the UC's, so I guess those would be my safeties ;)

39.<<<monroe115>>>
I mean the UC's besides Berkeley and UCLA

40.<<<Undercrackers>>>
You couldn't pick two more diametrically opposed types of schools in Reed and Cal :-) Size, teaching philosophy, you name it. That being said, I would not incur debt like you've described for an undergraduate degree; save that for grad school. Get yourself into either the top UC you can get into or to an LAC that is generous with $$ (they ARE out there).

41.<<<MYOS1634>>>
If you can get merit aid, I would consider a highly ranked LAC or a strong Honors College before Berkeley/UCLA for Philosophy at the undergraduate level due to very few classes under 30 students (most will be in the 40-60 range whereas discussions are very important in Philosophy); you need to find one that would offer you big scholarships. I'd definitely pick a LAC over a CSU though due to the prestige-sensitive nature of Philosophy PHD admissions. Unfortunately the combination of needing merit aid and Jan 1 deadlines mean your choices have become limited.
Look at Kenyon: they have merit scholarships (up to full tuition), no supplemental essays, and an excellent reputation.
Holy Cross is quite good for Philosophy also and has a Jan 15 deadline.
If you don't get sufficient merit aid, then UCB and UCLA will provide you with a high level education, not as personalized and writing intensive as LACs but still with excellent content.
I would strongly consider both UCB and UCLA at the PHD level though (remember that intellectual cross pollination means you can't get your undergraduate degree and graduate degree at the same place).

42.<<<monroe115>>>
[quote]Look at Kenyon: they have merit scholarships (up to full tuition), no supplemental essays, and an excellent reputation.[/quote]

Thank you so much for the recommendation! I never thought about applying there, but I'm going to send in an application right away. I didn't realize how many awesome scholarships Kenyon has, especially for someone like me. I have been studying jazz guitar for a long time, and I guess they have music scholarships, even for non music majors.

Do you guys think that the smaller class size and extra attention from professors would be worth the massive extra cost? (if I were to receive no merit aid). I'm not ruling out that I'd get merit aid, but I want to be as practical as possible. There's got to be a lot of people who didn't go to private school and still ended up becoming very learned and successful in their chosen fields.

43.<<<ucbalumnus>>>

PhD programs worth attending should be funded (tuition waiver plus living expense stipend), so students should not have to take substantial additional debt. Large debt for "grad school" can only realistically be taken for professional programs with strong well paid post-graduation job prospects (that will allow paying off the debt), such as MD medical school or top 14 law school (even then, very large debt can limit one's career and life choices, since there are physicians still paying down medical school debt almost until retirement).

Not at $100,000 of debt. The most you can borrow over four years without a cosigner is $5,500, $6,500, $7,500, $7,500 (total $27,000).
