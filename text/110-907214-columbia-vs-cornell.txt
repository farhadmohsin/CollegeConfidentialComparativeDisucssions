Hey everyone

2.<<<confidentialcoll>>>
tell us what you value, this is ridiculously undirected

3.<<<columbiacornell>>>
i probably am gonna major in physics/something along that line. since you're at columbia, can you tell me a bit about columbia's community? i've read about columbia students being individualistic and rather "cold" so what really is the sense of community there? how's the college life in general? Yeah, still pretty much undirected but i don't know where to begin. i kinda like both nyc and ithaca and am neutral towards the core. how's the core from your personal point of view, btw? have read mixed reviews about the core and i wont mind receiving more. thanks a lot.

4.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
A few threads to start:

<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/columbia-university/836242-down-wire-hard-sell-columbia.html</url>

<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/columbia-university/902588-columbia-vs-university-chicago-physics.html</url>

<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/columbia-university/861406-make-most-out-columbia-serial-no-1-a.html</url>

in the end 'xhaustion is hitting in, i agree with concoll, there is a lot that could be said, but a lot more that has been said on the subject.

help us out here a bit, tell us what you wanna know. in general - i believe there is no more exciting collegiete experience than columbia's; you will do things you could never do in ithaca, have experiences that go far beyond.

and ultimately it is really hard for us to combat mistruths such as columbia students are 'cold,' especially on an online format. if you are hearing that stuff and believing it, i don't quite know what I can say to make you not believe that other than suggest that you should visit campus and meet students, you'll be surprised. columbia students are certainly goal-oriented, but they are incredibly relaxed about it, and there is no real aggressive competitiveness. it is a nice paradox.

5.<<<muerteapablo>>>
Your decision will require consideration of the colleges themselves, and then their physics departments.
Columbia is urban and more selective, with an "intellectual" vibe and small(er) student community. Perhaps most of all, it is located in NYC.
Cornell is rural, physically gorgeous, and less selective (or at any rate, its 3 state schools and hotel school drag it down significantly). The student body is almost 3 times larger than Columbia, and the according sub-communities and layers reflect that. It is likely that you will find a niche at either school, though.

As for physics: Cornell is undeniably better. I know Columbians like to point to the Manhattan project (whose chief physicists, by the way, came from Cornell/MIT/Princeton/Harvard, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cornell_Manhattan_Project_people" rel="nofollow">List of Cornell Manhattan Project people - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a> ), and Columbia is certainly a force in academic physics, but Cornell's department is one of the all-time best, on par with Caltech and even MIT.
Just look at the US News rankings: Cornell is ranked 7th with a score of 4.7 (Princeton, for comparison, has a 4.9) while Columbia is ranked 11th with 4.3, flanked by Penn and UCSB (admittedly all great physics departments, but again, not the very best).
These rankings are borne out by similar rankings, such as the NRC (Cornell = 6, Columbia = 13) and others.

People like to point to Brian Greene, but he is not as much of a serious scientist as he is publicist. This is one of the reasons he moved from Cornell to Columbia; in order to avail himself more easily of the spotlight.

At any rate, they are both great departments, and it's unlikely that you would exhaust the resources of either one. Choose based on fit.

6.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
great post muerte - though would you agree that these rankings geared toward graduate students are not necessarily the best, plus they actually tend to be more conservative regarding shifts than even the usnews college rankings. columbia has a lot of young professors (30-50) that haven't quite gained the brian greene spotlight, but show a lot of promise in the field. this also means they are more interested and willing to work with ugrads - astrolion's experience being a great example of which.

all together, you can't deny cornell has a great department, but it might not translate into it being the ideal ugrad fit for the poster. only he/she can know what makes most sense.

7.<<<columbiacornell>>>
Thanks a lot guys! Thanks adgeek for your wonderful posts! I guess it can't go wrong with either school and I hope I wont regret -- and instead try to live every moment to its fullest at C or C, no matter what turns out to be my ultimate decision. That said, keep the influx of posts guys; i'd really like to see more of both schools before finally hitting submit this May 1.

Thanks!

8.<<<columbiacornell>>>
I can never thank all of you enough but here I am again, asking a question. What makes the Core different from the requirements of other great schools? Thanks a lot in advance :$ :)

9.<<<pwoods>>>
The Core is not just a set of requirements, stating that you have to take a certai number of history or science or English classes; it's a set of seminar-style classes that everyone must take. Every Columbia student must take Literature Humanities their first year and Contemporary Civilizations their sophomore year. These small (less than 20 students) yearlong discussion courses ensure that every student has a working knowledge of great works of literature and (political) philosophy, so that they have a core of knowledge they can rely on when discussing other works. Students must also take Art Humanities and Music Humanities, which ensures they have a working knowledge of art and culture, which is particularly important in New York.

The Core also serves a socially unifying purpose, since all Columbians and Columbian alumni must take the Core. Other schools may be united around their football team (whether they love it or think it sucks), but we are united around our Core (with the same diversity of opinion!)

10.<<<gedion9324>>>
Go to Columbia. If you're interested in physics and and other science related fields Columbia is the place to be. They have Nobel Prize winners teaching you. Plust there's Horst Strommer. In my opinion you should go to the school which is rated higher academically, i.e. Columbia.

11.<<<columbiacornell>>>
Hmm. Really split now :/

12.<<<monydad>>>
"They have Nobel Prize winners teaching you."

I took three physical sciences classes taught by future Nobel prize winners when I was an undergraduate at Cornell. These individuals are still there.

13.<<<muerteapablo>>>
[quote]In my opinion you should go to the school which is rated higher academically, i.e. Columbia.[/quote]

Actually, for physics, that would be Cornell.

I agree that Columbia is more selective for undergrad, but I don't think that their overall departmental rankings are better than Cornell's. Cornell is consider a top-notch research university, even if its undergrad's repute occasionally suffers in comparison to its peers.

14.<<<shahdin>>>
Columbia. no doubt

15.<<<gedion9324>>>
Again I think words like "fit" are used by students to maybe lessen the pain of rejection. You should go to a school with better funding and facilities. The vast majority of students fit into a school just fine after having chosen that school purley for its academic merits. Besides, if you don't like Columbia after going there for your freshman year you could always transfer to say MIT or Harvard. (Notice I didn't say Cornell)

16.<<<monydad>>>
"..better funding and facilities.."
To complete that thought, with respect to the physical sciences and allied fields of engineering, that school is probably Cornell, I would imagine.
However,frankly I think this is a strawman anyway, it's not like Columbia is horrible, OPs objectives would likely be quite adequately served at either.

17.<<<muerteapablo>>>
Does Columbia have better funding and facilities than Cornell?

I do know that Cornell has both more physics faculty AND more particle accelerators (if only by 1) than Columbia does...

18.<<<gedion9324>>>
"...that school is probably Cornell, I would imagine"

I imagine a lot of things, but I don't post them as concrete evidence. Again go to Columbia.

19.<<<columbiacornell>>>
There aren't many science majors in Columbia College, right. What about physics? heard there are 20-30 majors.

And i'm an international student. Can't visit these schools :(

Gedion, you seem to be a very strong advocate of Columbia physics? Do you mind sharing anything or why you think it's an awesome place to study physics? (apart from one professor heh)

20.<<<monydad>>>
"concrete evidence"

Well I'm sure there's some concrete in the brand spanking new,for Fall 2010, physical sciences building:
<url>http://www.duffield.cornell.edu/</url>

21.<<<3togo>>>
personally I think Columbia and Cornell are very similar ... with the big difference being the location ... Columbia in a great urban setting and Cornell in a great college town ... I would guess a visit to both would lead to a glear preference for most. (PS - for Arts &amp; Science folks Columbia's core also is a major thing to consider)

22.<<<monydad>>>
"...the big difference being the location .."

..and The Core. For my D1 this was the single biggest consideration.
You want it, or you don't want it.

23.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
agreed with mony, they are very different experiences.

but to add one more thought toward columbia. it is the fact that with 1/2 the number of ugrads, it is still far more diverse in a lot of markers. it is the intimacy of its programs that ultimately creates a rather unique and vibrant intellectual community, one that i would never give up for in the world.

and with a lot of connection to cornell (and upstate ny) i say this with complete respect, but the experience is far more mundane than columbia; it lacks the intimacy, vitality and in its truest sense diversity that a life at columbia and nyc may offer. your avg. days and nights will yield predictible results in ithaca, in new york it is a mystery waiting for you to bounce around and find it.

academically i would say the two schools are a bit of a wash - cornell is probably a better physics institution for graduate students, but columbia has probably a stronger ugrad population even in the sciences. which means you aren't necessarily far better off at one place or the other academically.

cornell just by the nature of it perhaps prepares one better for the idyllic life of academia - because you can experience it in many ways as a ugrad (there are fewer distractions). columbia will impress you as an 18yo with what life can offer, and how to maximize the experience.

in my mind - college is about far more than just academics, if it was the case then universities wouldn't have all the accoutrement that they do, nor would they look at non-academic indicators as reasons for admitting you. it is for this reason that i think you really ought to consider how truly transformative and unique life in new york city is. of course you could work there when you're done, but it is not the same. you will never get your life back from 18-22 to do over again - so choose the place that will help you find yourself more, that will challenge you more, and that will still give you a top flight education.

24.<<<monydad>>>
" i say this with complete respect, ,," etc..

...the fact is my daughter was attending school in NYC, hated it, and transferred out to Cornell, and is much happier. She said that NYC was a horrible college town. She prefers a campus-centered college town experience to "the concrete jungle", to spend this particular time of her life. And she has plenty to do there. So I guess this is an area where people may differ. YMMV, and all.

NYC is a great city though, come live there when you have $$ and can better enjoy it. Then you can take vacations in ithaca.

Or, go there now. And, hopefully love it.
Or love Ithaca. I do.

Wherever you choose to spend the next years will be transformative. But in different ways perhaps. The choice is yours.

25.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
nyc is not a college town per se. though i'd argue morningside heights approximates that college town feel.

but there are a lot of colleges in nyc that really have horrible resources, lack any distinguishable campus, are truly sink or swim experiences. and also are not as deeply ingrained into the intellectual, political and working world of the city as columbia is.

so bringing up your daughter's experience is a complete tangent. of course we could find anecdotes that challenge both of our general narratives - and with four dozen kids in my hs class that went to cornell, i know a lot of not so nice things about it.

the truth being that columbia+morningside heights+the rest of the city is a rather incredible combination, a delicate balance between intimacy and opportunity.

lastly: having also been a young professional in the city, you will never have the freedom and degree of adventure to enjoy the city. when you're living in a small cramped apt, barely making ends meet, that crazy idea to go try and sneak into a movie premiere is not necessarily at the top of your mind. the bs you have to deal with landlords that try to scam you, city taxes that take just a bit more bite out of your pay check, and any number of nuisances that honestly unless you are wealthy enough to own a very large apartment or the like, will always make new york less comfortable for young professionals.

there is something about being in the city when you are coming into your own, but do not quite have the financial responsibilities yet that is ideal.

Columbia may have half the number of undergrads as Cornell, but it has three times the number of graduate students. At the end of the day, professors at Cornell presumably have more time to dedicate to undergraduates. Every residential hall at Cornell has live-in faculty and faculty associates who dine with students on a daily basis. Every Greek house at Cornell has a faculty adviser, and undergraduate research is one of the hallmarks of the Cornell experience, especially in the physical sciences.

I don't see how an urban campus with thousands of individuals unaffiliated with a university can be more 'intimate' than a collegetown with institutions that have survived generations.

Columbia may very well offer a more diverse experience in some ways, largely thanks to the opportunities of NYC. But neither its academics nor its variety of student experiences are as diverse as what is offered at Cornell.

From engineers to horticulturists, philosophy majors to hotel managers, thespian arts scene to nationally competitive sports, organic farms to particle accelerators, Cornell is a very diverse school and there is nothing predicable about what you may find yourself doing in Ithaca on any given weekend.

27.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
[insert bucolic research university campus] sounds just like cornell!

what is more intimate than living within 10 min of everything you could ever need or want? have more small classes than cornell, have a core curriculum that ensures this intimacy, have class and social life merge within the halls of butler, the ramps of lerner. have your entire first-year class live within a city block of each other?

live literally where history was made, and a history that predates ithaca and cornell by over a century. to meander down the streets of the city that the first president of the country was inaugurated, walk a few meters and peruse Trinity Church where Columbia first got its start. to take a stroll along the Riverside Promenade and have a look out at the Palisades of the Hudson River Estuary, or any number of parks at your ready disposal that though not the beauty of the Finger Lakes, replicates, approximates, and provides the same level of distraction as the raw woods of New York's central valleys.

to experience in truth a duality - to be separated from the world, and yet in the middle of it all, to walk around morningside heights during the day, and see the busy throngs of reporters following a speaker, or find yourself on the roof of Wein late at night and see how peaceful the night is, or be up at 5am and walk around the quad to get this sense that you are the only one in the world around as you stand at the sundial.

28.<<<CayugaRed2005>>>
what is more intimate than living within a self-sustaining community of your peers? have more class offerings in more types of subjects than columbia, and have fantastic student activities that allows you to build your friends around your own interests. have class and social life merge within the halls of uris and olin, the terraces of willard straight and the cafes of green dragon, the big red barn, stellas, and the temple of zeus. have your entire first-year class live within a frisbee's throw of each other, and you can actually throw frisbees outside of your window?

live apart from the greater world so you can study it in peace and without unnecessary distraction, enjoying an intellectual mecca that has attracted scholars for generations. meander down the gorges and above the glacially carved hills of ithaca, pondering this world's existence, and your own. use the same equipment that the like of Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman and Hans Bethe used to make their miraculous discoveries. take a stroll down into the neighborhoods surrounding campus or into downtown Ithaca, which can provide the same entertainment, nourishment, and distraction as Morningside Heights.

And then return. Return in your memories and in your later years to a place that nourished and questioned, that supported and challenged. That makes grown men cry at the sight of it all again. Because unlike Odysseus, Ithaca is your beginning, not the end.

29.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
wow that ended really lame - nevermind the fact that at the end of the Odyssey, Odysseus doesn't end in Ithaca (this fact is unclear at the end of the Odyssey).

and the day a person seriously compares ithaca and new york city as equals, will be a sad day indeed.

30.<<<CayugaRed2005>>>
[quote]and the day a person seriously compares ithaca and new york city as equals, will be a sad day indeed.[/quote]

;)

31.<<<pbr>>>
I think the lesson the OP should take from this (generally) thoughtful discussion is that alums such as monydad, muertepueblo and CayugaRed2005, on the one hand, and admissionsgeek, on the other, are very fond of their alma maters, and are willing to say so. The OP should have a pretty good sense, based on this thread alone, of some of the key similarities (academics) and differences (environment, size, core vs. no core, etc.).

My Columbia son, from a suburb thousands of miles away from Cornell or Columbia, did not even consider Cornell. He's ecstatic with his Columbia experience, largely for the reasons identified by admissionsgeek (as well as his fraternity and rugby experiences).

I don't believe the choice of Columbia vs. Cornell should be based on an analysis of the relative strengths of a single academic department. The physics departments (as well as most other academic departments) are just fine at both schools. I would choose based on some of the softer factors discussed above.

32.<<<kartrider360>>>
muerteapablo actually goes to penn and puts down cornell any chance she gets...this is probably one of the few threads I've seen her write nice things about cornell...

back on topic...if you're going to be majoring in physics or any of the hardcore science/engineering majors, you should choose cornell

(excuse me for the lack of capitalization)

33.<<<monydad>>>
"so bringing up your daughter's experience is a complete tangent. "

She was in class across the street from you. she might have been in your intro language classes, 2-3 other classes, your clubs for all I know. Maybe the guy she was dating lived in your dorm. Maybe you ate in the same cafeteria (hers). She was in the same place, in the same city.Her experience with NYC is as relevant as yours. However, unlike you she also has experience living at Cornell which she prefers.

34.<<<muerteapablo>>>
Truthfully, I am not very fond of Cornell, and I actually left it for Penn. But I certainly recognize its strengths, and one of those is its physical sciences.

But ultimately I agree most with pbr (pabst blue ribbon? and yet you have a son, so I wouldn't take you for a hipster. does anyone else *drink* pabst, though?). The decision should not be contingent on minor differences in ranking - yes, Cornell's physics is better, but not by a margin significant enough to affect your undergraduate experience. Think instead about the "softer factors." These are invariably idiosyncratic. Examples include city vs. rural, small vs. large, and so on. There are also cultural aspects that may not be apparent to you as a foreign student: Cornell's social life is undeniably anchored in the fraternity scene, although it is certainly multifaceted - there is an artistic community, political groups, and so on. Columbia's is more urban, and generally understood as more "intellectual." Columbia College is slightly more prestigious than Cornell's CAS. And so on.

35.<<<monydad>>>
"Cornell's social life is undeniably anchored in the fraternity scene,"

??? Ok well I'll deny it. It may be anchored in that scene if you are in that scene. And freshmen attend lots of their parties. Period.
That's what, 30-40% of the students only? D2 hasn't gone near a fraternity. Neither did I, afer freshman year. I think your perspective on this reflects the fact that that's when you left. If you aren't in a fraternity their influence after freshman year is near nil.

Fraternities are nice options to have, for those who want them. For one thing, they provide better housing to their members than the dorms do. Columbia has them too, My nephew and D2s boyfriend were members. But the majority of students at Cornell do not join fraternities, and they do just fine without them.

If you like them though. frats can be real pluses. I think my nephew found his experience at his frat at Columbia to be about the best part of his experience there. They made the place more personal, and he developed some strong relationships.

36.<<<pbr>>>
I suspect that much of my Columbia son's happiness at Columbia is related to the sense of community he gains from his fraternity and his sports club. I can easily imagine a student without those types of anchors feeling adrift in college in NYC, which is why I read so much about the lack of the "sense of community" at Columbia. Whether it's a frat, or a sports club, or a drama production, or a music group, or a political organization, etc., I have the sense that community can be created at Columbia (or Cornell)--easily. Like life itself, college requires proactive choices.

Muertepueblo, PBR is my second favorite beer. True hipsters enjoy Schlitz--in a can. I had a couple Schlitz's tonight, by the way.

37.<<<CayugaRed2005>>>
[quote]I suspect that much of my Columbia son's happiness at Columbia is related to the sense of community he gains from his fraternity and his sports club.[/quote]

Thankfully, this is the case at most school. Columbia has fraternities and poetry journals. So does Cornell. You can be happy at most schools as long as you are willing to look for what you want to be around. And you don't hate the city or the countryside.

38.<<<pbr>>>
^That's what I tried to state. Agreed.

At some level, it becomes a struggle between the city and the countryside. I hope all make the right choice!

39.<<<monydad>>>
.. and The Core..

40.<<<columbiacornell>>>
Wow thanks a lot guys! Really appreciate the perspectives from Columbians and Cornellians :D This is great. I'm sure your schools are proud to have you guys! I guess it can't go wrong with either school, and I hope that when I made the decision I will be able to move forward with no regrets. Choosing one over the other is sure one tough decision to make. it's definitely a sad thing to abandon the other, especially after researching and reading so much about the school. I guess that's the greatest dilemma for me. Anyway, I want to commit to a school by this weekend so I can get things done asap (since im an international) i hope by then i would have a clear choice at the end of my mind albeit the strong attachment to the other school. :(

anyway, thanks a lot guys!

41.<<<monydad>>>
"..and the countryside"

well sorta, actually the vibe of Ithaca to me is primarily that of a hip, small city, surrounded by gorges and national parks. It hits well above its size, in terms of what's there. Of course what's there is not NYC, but you can afford it all and wherever you go you will be among a higher proportion of your fellow students. When I go downtown there I might be eating dinner at Moosewod, not milking a cow. Just to clarify.

42.<<<gedion9324>>>
Ahhh, yes. Everybody thinks that their school is better, which is why we need an independent, impartial ranking system, say like... US world news. I wonder which school was ranked higher? Columbia.

@Monydad I can go to the particular school's website and copypaste their ads, but I won't because it proves nothing. I'm sure you're daughter is having a great time in Cornell because she chose that school for reasons other than academics, but the OP's main criterion is academics. That pretty much crosses cornell out of his list. Don't misunderstand me, Cornell is a good college but it's better off competing with schools like New York University, Duke etc

43.<<<monydad>>>
I'm sorry if the fact that Cornell is stronger than columbia in physical sciences disturbs your world view and sense of self. US News does not specifically evaluate strength of particular academic departments , but The NRC rankings go towards that end. For physical science &amp; math Cornell was ranked #6, Columbia #14.

The links were relevant in that they go towards physical sciences facilities, which you claimed were better at columbia.They described two major facilities at Cornell that were
either absolutely new or just 6 years old.

Finally academics certainly did play a role in D2s decision. Her intended major is a very strong program at Cornell. Like physical sciences are. She is enjoying her courses at Cornell, equally or moreso than her previous courses on both sides of Broadway. Though she liked those too.

Columbia is a great university, however it is not equally great at everything.
Same can be said for Cornell.

Finally, I will say that after frequenting this board prior to and during D2s stay in Morningside heights, I've observed quite a number of people whose sense of self appears simlar to that seemingly exhibited by gedion9324, and some people might consider if this is who they want to hang out with. This played a role in D2 not applying to Columbia in the first place. To each their own, of course.

44.<<<herenow>>>
It's absurd to say one of these is strong in physical sciences than the other. They're both very strong. The differences at a graduate school level will vary by departments and on the exact research area and the faculty in that area. Very little of that degree of specialization matters at the undergrad level. More important for undergrad is the quality of the students, where C probably has an edge over C.

45.<<<monydad>>>
quality of students specifically majoring in physical sciences at each school is not quantified, but they are probably really darned smart, in both cases.

46.<<<herenow>>>
There are loads of quantitative indicators of overall student quality: Acceptance rate being a big one.

47.<<<muerteapablo>>>
Arguably more important are SAT averages/high school rank - those factors aren't nearly as subjective and often far more informative (see Caltech, and conversely College of the Ozarks). Of course, those numbers are also higher for Columbia.

48.<<<ChaoticOrder>>>

You're comparing Columbia, largely an arts and sciences school, to all the schools at cornell. Stick with analagous concepts; don't mix and match. If you compare the A&amp;S stats, we're not that different from columbia. Last year the acceptance rate was at 14% for A&amp;S, and this year, lower. Moreover, we are not comparing overall academics, we are comparing the subjects of interest of the OP.

In the sciences, according to the "unbiased" USNEWS, we rank higher than columbia. Chemistry: tied for 10 w columbia; math: 13, columbia 11; CS: cornell 5, columbia 17; physics Cornell 7, COlumbia 11; Biology cornell 11, columbia 15. Overall cornell>columbia in the sciences. In the humanities, Columbia>Cornell. Grad school quality does affect undergrad quality, seeing as we are taught by professors who teach both grad and undergrad.
Gedion, stick to rational arguments, not these blanket, ad-hominem attacks on the university at large founded in ignorance and naivete.

49.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
chaotic -

would you agree that undergraduate quality is also endogenous? that it comes from the students who participate? in a sense, this being the leveling factor as columbia's smaller (and by virtue cohesive, i.e. less of a range from top to bottom, and more cohesive in that students integrate more because of the core), and also that by most factors columbia is more selective, diverse and academically stronger, would render any minimal differentiation between 7-11 in physics rather mute? that's my stance - columbia's marginally better ugrad population means its marginally (i mean how laughable is it that you are distinguishing between two top tier sci programs) worse sci programs to cornell renders the two a wash. especially considering that columbia phys/sci folks are the most brilliant of the bunch.

in the end what is most important - they offer different experiences regardless of academics. and they lead students in different directions. in this regard the choice is rather clear between two rather distinct experiences. and the OP should read up from afar (unfortunately) what sounds more enticing, fully aware there is no wrong answer.

with all the bellicosity i could ravage against cornell, in the end it is a solid place, i wouldn't pick it - but that's as much a measure of the fact i grew up in Cornell's backyard as the fact that my past experience at columbia makes me bleed too much blue.

50.<<<AstroLion>>>
I feel like there's a lot of misinformation in this thread. Cornell has a slightly larger department, but that comes at the expense of a higher grad student: faculty ratio.

Facts from the American Physical Society Annual Handbook on Graduate Schools (which schools are obligated to provide information to):
Full-time assistant, associate, and full professors:
Cornell: 48, Columbia: 37
Graduate Physics Students:
Cornell: 181, Columbia: 111

I cannot find the undergrads:faculty ratio for Cornell, but I'll eat my shoe if it's lower than Columbia's as Columbia only has about ~30 physics undergrads, resulting in more emphasis on undergraduate research and smaller class sizes.

USNews rankings of specific departments, unlike the college rankings, are highly suspect as they rely ONLY on polling of faculty members asking then to rate other schools, and only 31% of faculty polled actually responded. This is a far cry from the more formulaic method that their college ranking uses, which is at least mostly based on hard stats. The NRC rankings also mentioned before are ~15 years old, and anyone who is actually in physics knows that they are unreliable and plagued by accounting errors and other problems (they left out entire schools, some of which are very highly regarded).

While I am biased towards Columbia, I think the two departments are comparable in terms of research and prestige, and the choice comes down to other factors. I believe Columbia provides a much better undergraduate experience due to the city, as I have learned just as much from my 4 years here from living in the city as I have in my classes. Quite frankly, I didn't bother applying to Cornell for undergrad or graduate school in this field, as the high-level research at Cornell can be found elsewhere, along with many things that Cornell doesn't have. The nitpicking between the two departments above is much more relevant for prospective graduate students, whereas the focus for prospective undergrads should be more of a question of fit.

51.<<<gedion9324>>>
Dear me, monydad, someone is bitter. I understand that you're being protective of your daughter but there's no need to insult me, or other prospective Columbians. As for my self worth being connected to my school, that seems to be the case with you too. I've always found that the defenders of a school with less quality, are the most...rabid.
Your daughter had already gotten in Columbia before she trasnsferred. Since that's the case its important you understand that I am in no way implying that your daughter is inferior. Her school is. The school that a student has gotten into might not necessairly reflect the student's true ability and potential as is the case with your daughter.

To the OP, I urge you to go to Columbia's website and check the physics department. I apologize if this thread has degenerated into a petty verbal match, but I have to respond, when a poster insults me.

I attended Columbia as a freshman and later transferred to Cornell's engineering school. The two main differences between the colleges are: 1) Class sizes - much larger at Cornell in virtually everything and 2) Social life - very little to do at Cornell other than student clubs and some outdoor activities (I tried rock climbing, for example). I'd say the student bodies are roughly comparable in terms of academics and diversity.

Except for a writing seminar and an advanced thermodynamics course, every course I took at Cornell had more than 50 students. At the introductory-level, Cornell's class sizes are at least double that of Columbia's. Example: Intro Physics courses at Cornell had about 400-500 students (engineers, science majors) while their Columbia equivalents had 250-300 students. I made a point to take as many non-technical courses at Cornell, and I still had a hard time finding classes with fewer than 100 students. Only when I made it to the 400-level courses in Economics and History, was I able to sit in a classroom where the professor didn't need a microphone during the lectures.

Socially, Cornell left a lot to be desired, and the Cornell/Columbia difference is obvious. I should mention that the weather in Ithaca is pretty miserable from November to March, and I found myself hating my decision to transfer in the middle of my sophomore year.

I shouldn't bring this up--as I may be sounding quite insensitive--but the weather likely had much to do with the depression I saw among some students while I was there. I happen to believe that the recent cluster of suicides at Cornell were brought on by a combination of Cornell's isolation and bad weather.

Personally, I think most students in the OP's shoes would be better off at Columbia than at Cornell. But that's just my opinion.

@ChaoticOrder and Mony Dad.

Right on the comments section of the article a Cornell student wrote this,

"I graduated from Cornell last May. I was also diagnosed with major depression my senior year.

There are a lot of factors that make Cornell students susceptible to depression:
1. Ithaca's weather. It is either raining or snowing from October to April. I believe we also got the least sunlight in the US? It really gets to your head when the sun sets at 4PM.
2. Cornell is considered "the easiest Ivy to get into, the hardest one to get out of". The workload is no joke. It's an incredibly high-strung environment.
3. The student body and the campus is huge compared to other elite private schools. It's really easy to feel lost and alone. Mix that with the elevated stress...no good.

That being said, the counseling services are excellent and really attentive. I had a great support team where my faculty advisor and social worker paired up to help me graduate on time. If you seek help, you will get it"

Well at least the the counseling is good. So you just have to hope that the counseling would work before the gorges start to look appealing...

To the previous poster- good luck and endure. You can still transfer out of "the easiest Ivy to get into".

Nice try. There was no pattern, whereas suicide and depression seem to be common. So much so that Cornell teaches its professors to identify depression in students. "Now kids E=MC2...hey is that kid depressed?". Detracts from the teaching don't you think?

Even the admitted student, who posted before me, thinks its a bad idea to come to Cornell...

"Nice try?"... Do you really want to continue with this scrap?? Really??? ...because sometimes people can find "patterns" where they are already looking for them. <i>Neither</i> fine school will win (and both are great and venerable institutions) when you continue with the card that you initiated in post #53:

I'm frightened and intimidated.(heavy sarcasm)

"Both great...institutions"

Another nice try. Both are great, yes. But Columbia is greater

[quote]Another nice try. Both are great, yes. But Columbia is greater[/quote]

Columbia is <i>not</i> better at the hard sciences. Cornell also is superior in architecture, and for engineering, and for veterinary medicine, and for industrial and labor relations, etc.

Nice try indeed.

<b>Both</b> institutions are, in fact, great and venerable, your immature snark notwithstanding.

OP if you go to columbia gedion9324 might be you rommate. Or someone just like him. there seem to be many here, based on posting patterns. Food for thought.

Re: jamescchen, his experience speaks for itself, it was what it was. However that is one transfer experience. D2 was also a transfer, has had small classes at Cornell,and big ones, it depends what you take. Coming is as transfer can be hit or miss at all schools. To wit, some comments on CC from a transfer to Columbia:

"My largest lecture had 400 students. It was taught in an auditorium where the professor gave very theatrical performance on a stage. The discussion section had 70 students. "

"Other professors were better (2nd semester Lit Hum, 1st semester contemporary civ), but I found that several did not take Core classes seriously. Basically, grad students and less experienced professors handle these courses, and many do treat it like a chore, coming in with the impression that their students will need to be spoonfed. "

"It's hard to meet people. There's no place where you can get to randomly know people. I hardly get to spend time with or even see my friends b/c our paths simply don't cross. Many people I meet turn into acquaintances b/c there isn't sufficient contact for us to actually become friends. Add to that the fact that most people aren't friendly anyway - it's chic to be jaded. "
"..the Columbia community- actually, it's not a community, it's just a crowd."

" I don't like my fellow students. So many people take one class in some random subject and think they know absolutely everything and proceed to talk about it as if they're an authority. Intellectual culture at Columbia is basically knowing trivia- you know of some obscure topic, but not in depth and not in any constructive way".

"..it's the sense of community that I'm really looking for. "Columbia" is not a real school, it's a collective of individual experiences, some good and some bad. I guess I want a sense of belonging to a place."

This is just one other transfer experience, the point is coming in as a transfer can be hit or miss everywhere. The issue is you do not have as good an opportunity to form the same level of social networks that freshmen get in the dorms. If you are not integrated socially it does not matter so much what there is to do, you will not have a good time. And if you are integrated socially you and your friends will find enough to do.
Fortunately, D2 fell into a good crowd of people right away, and is having a great experience there. She finds plenty to do, she is not bored.

When I attended, the upper level physics courses I took were sufficiently small. They were really hard though, that was more my issue than size. The 400 level math courses were larger, still lectures, but it didn't really matter. In some of those subjects, in the end, you have to sit there and figure out how to do the problems, no matter how many other people are also sitting there in the room. If you can.

"I happen to believe that the recent cluster of suicides at Cornell were brought on by a combination of Cornell's isolation and bad weather."

It was no more or less isolated during the preceding several years when there were no suicides there at all. Probably the weather was not much different either.Over longer periods, there are numerous articles floating about indicating that the long term rate of suicides there is at or below national averages.

It's true though that the weather is not wonderful in the winter,and you have to deal with it because you have to walk everyplace.

But that's one thing. Taking all "things" together, James Chen greatly prefers Morningside Heights, while my daughter greatly prefers living in Ithaca to living in Morningside heights, as a college student.
People differ, evidently.

I never lived in Morningside Heights, but I lived elsewhere in Manhattan for many years. I loved Manhattan. But I would not have loved it so much if I did not have money. When I was there I could go to the nice restaurants, not just stare into their windows.

I also loved Ithaca.It was not Manhattan, but it provided a more idyllic college experience for that particular time of my life.

I chose Columbia -- and I want to say that I did so not because I think Columbia is better than Cornell; I chose Columbia because I think it would be a better fit for me. I want to thank you guys for all your support and hopefully I will move forward with no regrets :)
To the pro-Cornell, you guys rock and I will always remember the other part of me. I will definitely visit Cornell in the future. Cornell is gorges :)To the pro-Columbia, Hello! :) Roar!

63.<<<admissionsgeek>>>
welcome, and i hope this spirited debate provided something in your decisionmaking. many thanks to those throughout who participated, especially you proud cornellians.

64.<<<monydad>>>
Good luck, hopefully you will love it there.

65.<<<3togo>>>
congrats ... I bet you will love Columbia and Morningside Heights

66.<<<gedion9324>>>
This thread was a small model of what happens with the vast majority of cross admits of Columbia and Cornell. I rest my case.

67.<<<Epaminondas>>>
^ok please stop now. monydad has already given his heartfelt wishes to the OP. I agree with some of your previous points, but now you're just gloating.

68.<<<confidentialcoll>>>
to columbiacornell, congratulations, I'd say that's a good choice ;)

to gedion9324, there's no need to rub it in, putting down schools that are considered on par with Columbia, really just hurts our image. Fit differences hugely outweigh any perceived differences in quality of education and prestige and you know that.

69.<<<columbiacornell>>>
There really isn't any need to boo one another. If I was the model, I am the best example, that there is no ultimate winning factor whatsoever. Both schools are great and I know i can't go wrong at Cornell, too. To future admits: this thread contains a lot of info not found in cu website or anywhere. Enjoy! thanks to Cornell supporters for enlightening me with the greatness of your school. Honestly, I love you guys too and Cornell has every reason to have you guys. People on this thread has been particularly helpful in giving sorta professional advices. Cc rocks! Love you guys! Roar!

Reason to be proud*
