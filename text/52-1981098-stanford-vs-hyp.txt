@stanfordfoodie I feel the debate is mainly Stanford vs Harvard, not Stanford vs HYP. I don't think there is much competition between Stanford and Princeton,Yale, since Stanford comes on top vs these two in virtually all aspects.

3.<<<Planner>>>
Here's another good article:

<url>http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/30/stanford-vs-harvard/</url>

4.<<<prezbucky>>>
Stanford is not better at undergrad than HYP, or at least not Y and P.

The quality of undergraduate education (actual teaching/academics) is probably even, with each school having its own strengths and relatively less popular majors. Stanford's advantage is that it is the only one located in CA -- that greatly helps its popularity, but it does nothing for actual quality. The others have more history, obviously.

Princeton is the richest per student, though all four are rich.

The student-prof interaction is probably best at Princeton, which is the most undergrad-focused of HYPSM. And Yale has a higher percentage of undergrads than Stanford too (though not by Princeton's wide margin...).

Yale has the residential colleges and the "try it out" thing where students try out their classes before committing.

I think the more meaningful and practical groupings that show the relative emphases of these schools are:

- Princeton and Yale are relatively more undergrad-focused
- Harvard and Stanford are relatively more grad-focused

So, no, especially for undergrad, Stanford isn't "better" than Princeton or Yale. (and neither is Harvard...)

5.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford has surpassed Yale and Princeton in practically every metric... annual fundraising... global rankings (NSWR not withstanding that places an inordinate amount of emphasis on 4 grad rates which favors non FBS schools and penalizes schools that have FBS athletic programs), selectivity and cross admits.

perhaps 10 years ago you could have made that argument. I would add that Stanford has occupied the top spot for fundraising (tops 8 of the last 10 years), selectivity (admit rate and yield) that have has historically occupied by Harvard.

I agree these days it's between Stanford and Harvard...

and with MIT in Engineering......

and with Berkeley, UCLA and USC in sports:)

6.<<<Penn95>>>
@prezbucky I dont necessarily disagree with what you are saying, but the fact still remains that even for undergrads people seem to be placing Harvard and Stanford ahead of Yale and Princeton. Harvard, Stanford have yield rates in the 80%+ range, Yale and Princeton usually are in the 68-70% range. Stanford is winning the cross-admit split over Princeton and Yale (and Harvard I think). Also in most other tangible metrics that really influence peoples perception (such as rankings, research output, acceptance rates, prominent alumni, fundraising), there is a gap between Stanford/Harvard and Yale/Princeton. The prominence of a school does not really stem from its undergrad focus.

7.<<<prezbucky>>>
No -- grad/research matter a lot in terms of overall university rep. But undergrad focus should matter to prospective undergrads, imo.

And does the H/S yield advantage speak to quality or location? For Harvard, Boston must be a selling point, and we know the California loc and weather are sometimes deciding factors for Stanford. Obviously location and weather are part of fit, and there's nothing wrong with them... but they shouldn't be considered part of academic strength. Fit, yes; but not academic fit.

I realize the difference in undergrad focus is not going to be extreme between P/Y and H/S, but a slight difference might make a student's experience just a little bit better: a little bit more prof contact, another activity, etc.

When you're trying to split hairs to compare two (or four...) hyperelite schools, it might be worth considering to what degree a school puts its undergrads first.

All this said, H and S obviously are great schools at the undergrad level.

8.<<<CA94309>>>
@prezbucky is right. Too much is being made of yield and how good a school is. Harvard has benefited from having one of the best financial aid packages. Stanford has the advantage that it is the only elite school in the west/southwest, an area that is seeing a surge in population.
Schools manage their yield. They get far more qualified applicants than they can admit, so they can make selections to meet specific yields.

9.<<<TiggerDad>>>
Stanford has approximately 2,000 more undergrad students than Princeton. As a parent, I'm naturally concerned about the quality of undergrad EDUCATION that my son is going to receive in the next four years, and someone would have to come up with lots of convincing evidences that an institution with 2,000 more undergrad student body is getting a better undergrad education, care, and support. What I see too often is the college bound kids prioritizing name brand and prestige before quality as their decision making. The truly smart ones among them would choose Princeton for undergrad (or Williams and other great LAC's that offer quality undergrad education, for that matter) and then Stanford (or other "prestigious" universities) for grad program. All these "which college is THE best" is really silly and juvenile.

10.<<<Lagging>>>
Having attended Stanford, I can't say that I ever felt the focus was on graduate student and not undergrads. Maybe it would change by major, but having such outstanding grad programs provided not just outstanding undergraduate opportunities, but also the chance to take graduate coursework and engage in research at some of the country's top rated graduate schools.
[quote]someone would have to come up with lots of convincing evidences that an institution with 2,000 more undergrad student body is getting a better undergrad education, care, and support[/quote]

I'm curious @TiggerDad - can someone come up with convincing evidence that 2000 more undergrads means a worse education? Maybe at massive and under-funded schools, but at Stanford v Princeton?

11.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Lagging - I never said that 2000 more undergrads means a worse education. My argument was directed at those who blindly and uncritically state things in favor of Stanford based on its popularity. Each and every student is different and has different need. What's a good college fit is not necessarily a good college it in another.

12.<<<Penn95>>>
@TiggerDad The truly smart ones among them would choose Princeton for undergrad (or Williams and other great LAC's that offer quality undergrad education, for that matter) and then Stanford (or other "prestigious" universities) for grad program.

Not necessarily, it depends on the kind of undergrad experience one wants and what they want to study. I find it hard to believe that the quality of undergraduate education (however one can measure that), at Princeton is meaningfully better than at a place like Stanford.

The truth is that admits are not just motivated by quality of education when choosing amongst tippy top colleges, since any such difference is hard to measure at this level, especially amongst HYPS. They look at strength in their areas of interest, environment (large vs small school, urban vs rural etc), vibe and perceived prestige. Financial aid does enter into the equation but when we are talking about HYPS the financial aid differences are bound to be negligible and each school tends to match the FA given by another.

@CA94309 Harvard benefits because it has the strongest brand name of any institution in higher education and a very long history of being perceived as the ultimate dream school. Stanford benefits because it is quickly approaching Harvard in brand prominence, is at least equally as strong or better in all fields, but it has a cooler/hipper brand and is seen as the future and something different from Harvard. Yale and Princeton live, to an extent, in Harvard's shadow, Stanford does not.

I don't think location or financial aid fully explain the gap in yield between H/S and Y/P. Location might be bumping Stanford's yield a bit but it doesn't account for most of the 12 percentage point difference. HYP sure have to fight over those cross-admits that decide to stay east (and Harvard usually wins), but there are increasingly many east coast kids choosing to reject HYP to go west to Stanford and there are also California kids who go for HYP instead of Stanford. The advantage Stanford has it hat it doesn't really have to fight with any other school for the cross-admits staying west.

I am not saying that H/S are better choices than Y/P, I am just making an observation about how these schools are perceived nowadays.

13.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Penn95 - "I find it hard to believe that the quality of undergraduate education (however one can measure that), at Princeton is meaningfully better than at a place like Stanford."

Again, I NEVER said that Princeton is "meaningfully better than at a place like Stanford." I personally don't like those with elitist attitude, and I'd never put Princeton (or any college, for that matter, including Harvard from where I received one of my three "prestigious" graduate degrees) above any other colleges. About two or three decades ago, I remember, whenever Harvard loses in an athletic event, the students would yell at the opposing team, "it's okay, you'll work for us when you graduate" or something to that effect. Harvard, being dismayed at such asinine attitude displayed by its students, put a stop to that and rightfully so. Fast forward to today, it's the Stanford students who are more likely to display such attitude than any other colleges nowadays. I also remember receiving a copy of Harvard Magazine about two decades ago that featured all the failed Harvard graduates, those who ended up driving taxi cabs and high rise window washers in NY and other cities after graduation. The point is you can go to whatever college you think is the BEST of them all and don't amount to much, or become the next Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, Barack Obama, or whatever. It's all up to each individual aspirations that make the person a successful story or not regardless of which college one graduates from (or non at all). This is what makes America great, the land of boundless opportunities.

What does it take to get through to so many juvenile minds out there that there is simply no BEST school out there? There, however, is the better fitting college out there for each and everyone. Ultimately, it's what you make of the years in college. The college ITSELF isn't going to do it for you, no matter which college that is. The fact that my son is headed to Princeton is no guarantee that he'd be successful in comparison to someone else's son or daughter heading off to, say, the State University of ______ . Just lose the elitist attitude, as it serves no one any good. That goes for Harvard, Yale, Princeton, MIT, Stanford or whatever.

14.<<<Lagging>>>
@TiggerDad
[quote]What does it take to get through to so many juvenile minds out there that there is simply no BEST school out there[/quote]

You say that, then advocate certain schools as the best choices and heavily imply that the undergrad education is impaired at Stanford due to a larger class size when compared to Princeton. No one's saying Stanford is the best - I don't know who you're trying to argue with here...
[quote]Fast forward to today, it's the Stanford students who are more likely to display such attitude than any other colleges nowadays[/quote]

Any substantive proof for this sweeping claim?

Princeton was the only school I took off my app list after visiting because of the elitist attitude of the profs, student tour guides, and already admitted student in the tours. Though obviously experiences widely differ - I'm not going to make the generalization that Princeton is the most snobby of the Ivies from one (awful) experience.

15.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Lagging - You know what? As long as you and I can agree that the elitist attitude doesn't serve any good purpose, then we don't need to argue ad infinitum based on misunderstanding. We're all good.

16.<<<Hoggirl>>>

Who's being elitist now? What's wrong with driving a taxi or washing windows for a living?

17.<<<prezbucky>>>
"Best" is elusive, since so many factors go into making a place the best for a particular student. I think it's more important, and useful, for kids to try to find the best school for them, rather than rely on reputation rankings -- or any other ranking, really -- to guide their search.

Stanford is going to be the best fit for some kids, YPH for others, Chicago or Columbia or a LAC for yet others. The important thing, IMO, is for the kids to form a list of things they think are important -- fit variables -- and rate schools according to those things. If they go through the process without too much bias, and if their favorite is also affordable... they can't really go wrong.

Regarding the % of undergrads on a campus... obviously Harvard, Stanford and MIT (and Columbia, and Chicago...) know how to teach undergrads effectively, even if they are less than 50% undergrad. I just think, vaguely (this would be hard to prove...), that the higher the proportion of undergrads, the more the school must be of (well duh...), by, and for them.

You might be able to quantify that a little bit by figuring out how much a school spends on each student (taking into account differences in enrollment in more expensive majors and standard of living...) and average class size. But there might also be unprovable qualitative factors, like budget discussions among trustees/budget committees -- where does the money go first if they're deciding between a grad program and an undergrad program? Whom do the higher-ups aim to please most? Whom do they see as their primary bell cow?

I'm not sure it's possible to know without being in those meetings; to be a fly on one of those walls.

18.<<<TiggerDad>>>
As a disclaimer as well as to reveal more of our situation, my son was admitted to Williams, Amherst, Pomona, three Ivy League colleges, Duke and others. After hours and hours of research from all different angles at all the colleges that my son was admitted to, my own personal conclusion was that Williams was the best for my son based on its quality of undergrad education, experience, and opportunities. I found Williams, apart from its remote location and such, to be phenomenal from a parent's perspective. My son, however, decided that Princeton is his top choice. I'm obviously not the one who's going to college, so I backed off. Then, when Princeton sent an astounding mail about readjusting the original FA offer, I was floored. I made up my mind then and there that I fully support my son's college choice. Stanford, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, etc. are top elite schools, no doubt, but being "elite" is not good enough to make one's choice. Ultimately, the right choice is the one where you feel confident that you can thrive and benefit the most from.

19.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Hoggirl - I didn't come up with that featured piece on Harvard Magazine; Harvard did.

20.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@prezbucky - Can't agree more. :)

21.<<<Hoggirl>>>
@TiggerDad - did Harvard Magaine characterize/label them as "failed" Harvard graduates?

22.<<<prezbucky>>>
I imagine Williams is one of those schools for which kids make a large part of their decision based on its location: you can either take the cold and isolation, or you can't. But man, academically, is there a better school in the US? The tutorial method they offer -- 2 students, 1 prof -- seems look it would be so awesome.

There is also the stigma that all LACs face: the relative lack of awareness outside of their state or region.

@TiggerDad , did prestige/awareness of the school play a part in his Princeton decision, or was it all about fit? (was the isolation of Williams, and/or maybe the small size, a con?)

23.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Hoggirl - Not exactly in that term, "failed," but why else would they feature all the cases of Harvard graduates washing high rise windows, driving taxis, etc.? To brag what successful graduates they produced? Would you prefer that your child, after all the money, time and effort spent, end up as a hamburger flipper, taxi driver, construction laborer? Is that why you sent your child to whatever the college? There's a difference between being elitist and wanting your child to succeed. I'm all for the latter but don't care much for the former. I hope I made my point clear.

24.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@prezbucky - In all honesty, I'd be lying if "prestige" had no role in his decision. I have yet to meet a high school kid who had had chosen the college based strictly on the educational quality alone. They're naturally impressionable and malleable. Reputations, USNWR rankings, and such seep into their consciousness like ivy. Having said that, though, we've had some quality discussions on what's best for him from all different angles, from his choice of study to his long-term goal. Between Williams and all other colleges, our best compromise is Princeton based on all seriously considered factors. I still feel almost 100% assured of my son's success if he decided on Williams. I'm a bit anxious with his choice of Princeton. But, as I said, I'm not the one who's going to college. It's his choice and he will have to be responsible for his choices he makes throughout his life.

25.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@prezbucky - Williams, oh my.... If there's an ideal college, that's Williams. You asked, "academically, is there a better school in the US?" I've been to arguably the best colleges in the world, but I bow to Williams. It's extremely unfortunate that such LAC's don't get the recognition they absolutely deserve.

26.<<<prezbucky>>>
Well, I don't think any university combines academic excellence and undergrad focus quite as well as Princeton. So if it isn't a LAC, at least he's at Princeton. :-)

27.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@prezbucky - Just can't argue with you, can I? :)

28.<<<CA94309>>>
Why don't we use a different metric to compare universities. If more people buy a particular brand its probably better than the other brands. Similarly, won't a school with more applicant be better than one with fewer applying ? UCLA will beat any other university hands down.

29.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@CA94309 - Well, that's like saying if more people shop at Walmart than Gucci, Walmart is better store. What I prefer is to get rid of all rankings and hype so that college shoppers get to truly evaluate each school's quality of education and resources that are most conducive to the student's probably chance at success.

30.<<<websensation>>>
@prezbucky My kid will go to Stanford, but I agree with you. If I am honest, I feel comfortable in saying that in terms of quality of education, Stanford is a top 20 among all colleges (I would say the same for Harvard) and top 5 in the prestige factor. I definitely understand why some would choose P and Y or Williams or Pomona or Rice over H or S. For us, S was ideal due to my kid liking S, not because he thought Stanford was the best school in the world. I encouraged my kid to seriously consider a top Honors College also, but when your kid wants to go to Stanford and we can financially afford to send him, as a parent, you just support him and be happy for him.

31.<<<dongrae>>>
I totally agree with penn95

32.<<<dongrae>>>
Nowadays, Harvard always compares its stat with Stanford not YP. When I read the crimson, I can feel what school they feel as a rival no matter what other school parents claim.

No, probably not, but if that was what he chose to do, I wouldn't label him a failure as long as he was happy, well-adjusted, self-supporting, and had a good moral character.

I do understand your point. I just think my definitions of success and failure are different than yours.

35.<<<Planner>>>
I think it's important to remember that ultimately, college is just more "school," no matter where a student goes. Although a particular school can determine the course of one's life, it usually doesn'tthe four years come to an end, and students are launched into the "real world" (or further education). For most, which "elite" school they attend won't matter much. My son had his choice of the very top schools and picked Stanford; I doubt the ultimate outcome of his life would vary much if he'd chosen Harvard, Yale, or Princeton. (For what it's worth, I always thought a small LAC would be a better fit for him, but I wasn't the one making the decision.) Whatever school students choose, their lives usually continue far beyond the four years at college. And in this tier of schools, it really doesn't matter, outcome-wise, which particular one they choosethey all offer great opportunities, experiences, courses, professors, peers, and alumni networks.

36.<<<websensation>>>
Good weather probably helps quality of the school because happier people probably makes the school better. So, yeah, I think good weather is a positive factor in creating a happier or less depressed group of students and professors. Given a similar level of schools, I have no problem choosing the one with a nicer weather.

37.<<<prezbucky>>>
@stanfordfoodie

Re: 33

1. How do we define academic talent -- test scores among enrolled students? There, HYP > Stanford. GPA? I'll have to look those up, but I imagine they're pretty even. So how exactly are Stanford students more academically talented -- at least, objectively/quantitatively -- regardless of yield?

2. I don't think that the quality of student fundamentally changes the quality of education provided by the school. Academic quality is primarily a function of teaching quality, class size (though it's more of a factor to some than others...), research opportunities in applicable fields, close academic contact with professors, and academic resources available. You might say that smarter students will improve the quality of classroom discussion and academic output, but again, they are paying to be taught. The onus is on the school to teach them, not vice-versa.

Obviously HYPSM are of roughly equal quality regarding students, teachers and resources. I wanted to make that point because I felt you were giving far too much weight to student quality in terms of judging the academic quality of a school. (If I mischaracterized/misunderstood your opinion on the matter, I apologize.)

I agree that there are many reasons why students choose their schools, from sports scene to party scene to academic fit (as they see it...), to many other potential motives; and location and weather may have nothing to do with some kids' choice of school. But you have to admit, California is hot (and.. warm..) these days. :-)

38.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford doesn't view Princeton as competition. Princeton might though:)

39.<<<TiggerDad>>>
I find it very interesting, a phenomenon in itself, that whenever a college entrant asks a "which college should I choose?" question that pops up quite frequently on top college forums at this time of the year," the responses are quite different from those who are affiliated with Stanford than any from HYP. There are always two or three zealous supporters of Stanford, I noticed, that use such questions as opportunities to promote, gloat and self-aggrandize Stanford instead of offering critical insights based on their knowledge, information and wisdom in guiding the person in the right direction. For them, Stanford is simply THE BEST in everything. For them, it's all about the question of who has greater prestige and, of course, it's Stanford, and it has to be. Reading these threads, I can't help cringing with a sense of embarrassment. It's the feeling one gets when one encounters nouveau riche, those who have never had tasted ever being on top of something, anything, in their entire lives before suddenly finding this new riche and HAS TO tell someone, anyone, about this overwhelming joy and happiness. They spend inordinate amount of time digging up how many Nobel Prize winners the school is associated with, which on the Fortune billionaire list that graduated from the school, study every school (and department) rankings that ever existed, and how many NCAA National Championships the school won, etc. as the new, all consuming passion.

When someone asks a question about which college he or she choose, please stop embarrassing yourselves and stick to the original topic and offer your best insights, knowledge and experience in guiding the person.

Just my 2 cents.

40.<<<TiggerDad>>>
I posted my 2 cents before sbballer's. See, that's what I mean. An embarrassment.

41.<<<reuynshard>>>
Jeez, why does a thread like this pop up every few days. If everyone is truly so confident that Stanford is the best school on earth without peer, then there wouldn't be so many overzealous posters trying to convince everyone else that this is indeed the case.

Comparing universities isn't like comparing top speeds on cars. There are lots of factors like campus, resources, research reputation, student culture, undergrad focus, special programs, recruiting, cost, etc. and different people weigh different factors differently.

@reuynshard I dont think anyone is saying that Stanford has no peers, that would be an absurd claim to make.

@ewho Not surprised, as overall universities Harvard, Stanford, MIT are a cut above the rest, they are mainly looking at each other for what to do moving forward and exchanging ideas etc.

45.<<<TiggerDad>>>
Allow me to indulge in a bit of confession..... ta da... :) ,

In the 80's, I was at Cal Berkeley for one of my three grad degrees (don't ask, it's a long story). While I was there, most of my classmates were from HYP, Berkeley, and Stanford. While they all had the finest minds, one of the biggest impressions that I had at the time was how humble those students from HYP were. One student, in particular, stood out from the crowd. While I was busy playing ping pong after dinner at the International House at Berkeley, I'd see him walking across from us with his violin case and going into the sound-proof, music practice room that was adjacent to the recreation room. I think he was younger than me, but I was his secret admirer. He comported himself with class, with humility, with a self-defacing air about him. He just went about his business; I didn't see him mixing with the crowd, but he always looked content and happy. I learned from the I-House booklet that he graduated from Princeton. I told myself, at the time, that when I eventually get married, I'd like to have a son like him. At the time, ironically, I had NO IDEA that my son is now headed to Princeton.

I then went on to a grad school at Harvard. There, too, I didn't come across anyone who I'd label as arrogant or a braggart. All the students I met either at my grad school or at the undergrad events, never did I ever feel a sense of shame like I do with certain folks on this forum. They all comported themselves with a sense of quiet confidence yet without the inferiority complex mixed with a tint of the Icarus Complex. People who possess true confidence with themselves and comfortable with who they're don't go around trying to prove everywhere that they're better than others.

A few decades later, when my son was applying to colleges, knowing that he was within the range of any top schools in the nation with the quantitative scores with the talent and EC's to go with, we had the decision to make as to which colleges to apply to. He was easily considered the top violinist in the state as he took all competitions that were available in the state. He secured the concertmaster position at the major city orchestra in the state, all-state, as well as the national level orchestra. He was accepted to all music camps in the nation that he applied to, including the prestigious Heifetz International Music Camp at the age of 14 and the Aspen Music Festival at the age of 16. Even though he had a very realistic shot at Juilliard or the New England Conservatory of Music, he didn't want to pursue music as a career, so we passed auditioning at any of them. I was happy, as I saved a bunch of money.

Perhaps because of the fact that I did earn a grad degree from Harvard, when time came to his college applications, his order of priorities was: Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Stanford, in that order, among the "national" universities and Williams, Pomona, and Amherst among LACs. He applied to 16 colleges in all, and this period was his most stressful time of his life applying to all these colleges while taking 8 most rigorous IB courses while, at the same time, preparing himself for the next concerto competitions, recitals, concerts, and auditions. He averaged about 4-5 hours of sleep a day during this time period. He slept when I was driving him to violin private lessons an hour away and he slept on the way back. When he began writing college application essays, he started with the ones that he desired the most, namely, Harvard, Princeton, UPenn, Dartmouth, Williams, and down the list. He specifically targeted those colleges with a great music degree program or a great music performance opportunities with subsidized private instructions. Harvard (with NEC nearby), Princeton (with the Royal Conservatory of Music in London opportunity) and UPenn (with the Curtis Institute nearby) and Dartmouth (the only college with the "Music Study Abroad Program"), easily rose to my son's top target. In retrospect, I think my son got so exhausted with everything going on that he turned in lousy essays to all the rest of colleges that he considered a "backup."

Interestingly, he got either waitlisted or rejected by those colleges he paid the least attention to with essays (including WashU of SL and Vanderbilt, both which he didn't even bother sending his music supplement) but accepted to those that he spent the most time carefully composing his essays. Essays, it turned out, are really important! Out of his top choices with the great music programs, he was accepted to all but Harvard, namely, Princeton, UPenn, Dartmouth, Williams, Amherst and Pomona. Although he was accepted to Duke, as well, it really didn't have the kind of music program that my son desired, so it didn't really have any significant role in the final decision making. While both my son and I respected Stanford, given my son's undergrad needs, it also didn't have much of a significance. In fact, my son only applied to Stanford because one of his best friends in high school practically begged him to. He wrote half-hearted lousy essays to Stanford, and that was that. Ultimately, what came down to was Princeton and Williams. As I've mentioned elsewhere, I was all for Willams simply because of my opinion that it offered the best undergrad education of any top colleges out there, including HYP and Stanford. Sure, it, unfortunately, lacked the recognition that it truly deserves, but I do know how to detect quality as opposed to hype. My son, on the other hand, chose Princeton. Knowing that I'm not the one who's going to college and also knowing that Princeton had the best reputation for undergrad education and focus among national universities, we reached a happy compromise. Both offered a great music program with pre-med on the side. When Princeton subsequently sent us a mail that indicated their willingness to readjust their original FA aid package from generous to even more generous, that was it for us.

I helped my son choose his college based on his best fit, quantitative and qualitative wise, NOT based on prestige alone. Now, if my son was strongly interested in CS or something similar, he'd have spent greater attention and energy in applying to Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, MIT, CalTech, and Berkeley, but given his music + pre-med interest, Stanford was his backup choice. In the end, everything worked out. I hope that parents help their kids choose the right college based on the best fit as opposed to all these silly frat-level mentalities displayed more than amply enough already as is. Funny how I chose "TiggerDad" as my CC moniker way before my son has ever even thought about applying to Princeton. He's now heading to Princeton with a violin case in his hand, just like that boy from my Berkeley days. Funny how things turn out, like destiny.

So what you are saying is that in your opinion, even back in the 80's Stanford students were not humble but the same loudmouth embarrassing braggarts you complain about above? Hmmm.

You talk about humility and how gauche it is for the nouveau riche to brag about their wealth and then we get a long diatribe extolling the virtues of your son and how incredibly talented he is. Again, hmmm.

Speaking as someone who has spent time doing research at top schools like H,C, and P and was accepted to the top acronym schools, I think you find humility at all of them, including and especially, Stanford. One of the reasons I chose to come here was the extremely laid back student body almost completely devoid of all the social stratification that comes with Final clubs, Skull &amp; Bones and certain eating clubs. Since I've been here, I haven't come across anything resembling the behavior you describe in post #39.

Sure there are some posters who are very enthusiastic about Stanford on this thread. It's in the Stanford forum so what do you expect? Do the gentleman posters of the Princeton forum not extol the virtues of their school or would that embarrass you too much?

Glad your son will be a Princeton man. Congrats to him and I wish him well.

Btw, the only thing I don't disagree with you about is Williams. I think the teaching there coupled with the tutorial system is almost unmatched and graduates have unbridled access to top jobs and graduate schools. Here though, location and weather play a major role in the decision process beyond the prestige factor.

47.<<<potterfan>>>
Totally agree with @Multiverse7. One of the main reasons why I chose Stanford was because of the people. I didn't apply to Princeton, but my brother did and he got in. Princeton, among Stanford and MIT, was in his top 3, but he's gotten a snobby vibe from some students (along with the Harvard and Yale undergrads), something he has not perceived from Stanford/MIT.

48.<<<Lagging>>>
Agree with @Multiverse7 and @potterfan - the driving reason I chose Stanford was the atmosphere of a laid back, humble and collaborative student body. Of the Ivies, I found Brown to be most similar in vibe to Stanford. Princeton and Stanford were IMO the most different. Princeton came right off the list after a visit without any hesitation.

Of Princeton v Stanford, one school definitely has more of a reputation for elitism and snobbish attitudes, and it's not Stanford. Regardless, you'll find snobs and humble students at both schools.

Prospective students should visit and they can see the snobbery/elitism (or lack thereof) themselves. I'm not concerned with how they'll find Stanford :)

49.<<<slushy>>>
Chiming in now. I am very grateful to have DC at both Princeton and Stanford. Both schools are amazing with some of the brightest and most humble students and professors that my DC have encountered. I won't repeat what others have written, but some things to considered about Princeton vs. Stanford are: semester system vs. quarter system (depth of study vs. taking 1/3 more classes w/the quarter system - lends itself to more interdisciplinary studies); undergraduate focus with 2/3 undergrad &amp; 1/3 grad students vs. 1/3 undergrad &amp; 2/3 grad students which provides more grad courses available for undergrads; 4 seasons climate vs. basically 2 season climate; smaller suburban campus w/gentle hills and walkable vs. expansive campus (bikes everywhere); traditional, studious, and quiet campus vs. contemporary, active, and busy campus (Stanford has LOTS of events and conferences happening every day); grades focus in a post-grade deflation class environment vs. less grades focus (though still important) - leans more towards grade inflation; quite scholarly &amp; theoretical (adding to knowledge) with more traditional opportunities for application vs. scholarly &amp; theoretical with lots of opportunities to apply knowledge in Silicon Valley, industry, NGO's (it is not uncommon for Stanford students to take a quarter or more off to travel or work/intern,); required Junior Paper and Senior thesis vs. optional Senior thesis. IMO, Princeton seems to be more serious and purposeful in tone (east coast culture?) versus Stanford has a fun and even wacky tone at times (notice Stanford's band) that has fueled the entrepreneurial and innovation school spirit. The campus vibes and culture are different at each school but the caliber of the people are similar. Both schools have an extensive and active alumni network but Princeton is famous for its annual reunions where alumni can return every year instead of every five years. Besides these comparisons and your area of academic interest, do check out the extracurricular activities that each school offers. I hope you plan on attending Princeton's Preview Days and Stanford's Admit Weekend. My DC chose the schools most suitable for them and never looked back. Many congrats on your acceptance to both Princeton and Stanford!

Slushy poster hit the nail about Stanford culture. My kid and I feel that Stanford is a better fit for him than Princeton. I have to say that I met the Stanford people who reviewed my kid's essays and they were not only pretty young (below 30), but very nice, personable and humble people. I thanked them for being sensitive enough to appreciate my kid's essays.

51.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@multiverse - "Sure there are some posters who are very enthusiastic about Stanford on this thread. It's in the Stanford forum so what do you expect? Do the gentleman posters of the Princeton forum not extol the virtues of their school or would that embarrass you too much?"

First, I want to thank you for having read everything I wrote. It was rather long, and I didn't think anything I said was entertaining enough to be read word for word. I'm not going to defend myself and will take your criticism squarely.

The Princeton forum is pretty boring, nothing like here. Here, I get the strongest vibes that Stanford's supremacy needs to be affirmed and reaffirmed as if, if you don't, the sense of supremacy is going to erode away. THAT's embarrassing to witness. I've been visiting P's forum for a long while and so far not a single post that I can even remotely characterize as embarrassing. They seem collectively nonchalant about P vs.... type of nonsense as if it's all self-explanatory unlike a couple of posters here with the constant need to prove that Stanford is (always) better, which indicates to me an underlying deep self-esteem issues. I have a very healthy dosage of respect for Stanford and that's why, if you're a good reader, you'd have noticed that I never said a bad thing about Stanford itself. Who knows, my son might end up doing his grad work there someday? To me, Stanford doesn't need to always measure itself against its peers nor does it need a couple of cheerleaders who seem to embarrass the name of Stanford than helping it.

52.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@slushy - Nice, quick synopsis of both schools. Wish we have more of such informational comparisons. Very helpful.

53.<<<Penn95>>>
@TiggerDad i dont think that is a fair thing to say...people have posted in both the Princeton and the Stanford forum about this same topic and people have expressed their opinions...there are people who like one school more than the other and are just expressing their opinion...and i see people on both sides doing it...

54.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Penn95 - "...just expressing their opinion." Yes, sure, but don't forget that I'm also "just expressing my opinion," too. :) I can see from you point of view why my opinions are unfair whereas you'd totally approve of "their opinions" even if based on outrageous bias and sweeping generalizations. You have a tremendous need to promote Stanford, so I understand.

55.<<<Penn95>>>
@TiggerDad Yes and you are free to express your opinion, but you seem to dismiss any opinion not aligned with your beliefs and call people expressing opposite beliefs embarrassing and overzealous. What are the sweeping and outrageous generalizations? Also what i can't help but notice is that the Stanford forum is full of people with a great need to put Stanford down or assert the standing of Princeton or Yale. I don't see people in favor of Stanford posting continuously on the Princeton or Yale forum, being outraged at the sweeping generalizations against Stanford...

In any case i don't understand what you are so annoyed about. This is the Stanford forum so there are bound to be people that really like Stanford. You can state you opinion and people will respond and hopefully there will be a discussion. There is no need to take it to the next level and call people embarrassing and overzealous when in fact you are at Stanford's forum trying to convince people of Princeton's standing relative to Stanford or sth.

56.<<<sbballer>>>
TiggerDad = Triggered Dad:)

57.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Penn95 - "What are the sweeping and outrageous generalizations?"

These are just some that I was able to quickly grab off not just from the Stanford forum but Princeton forum, as well. If I want to spend a bit more time, I'm sure I can find a lot more by visiting Yale and other forums. I can see why you're sensitive to my earlier comments since you authored about half of the following:

"I feel the debate is mainly Stanford vs Harvard, not Stanford vs HYP. I don't think there is much competition between Stanford and Princeton,Yale, since Stanford comes on top vs these two in virtually all aspects."  Penn95

"Yes I think Stanford is more prestigious than Princeton (and Yale)."  Penn95

"I would put Stanford neck and neck with Harvard for the top spot, ahead of Princeton and Yale. But I will not be surprised if in the next few decades Stanford even surpasses Harvard in terms of prestige."  Penn95

"Stanford has surpassed Yale and Princeton in practically every metric..."  sbballer

"Overall Stanford is the stronger school across the board... and if you do change your major.. which often happens Stanford will be equally strong.. and yes this includes all the humanities and all the "soft" majors."  sbballer

"there is no question Stanford is the stronger school across the board...and if you decide to change your major Stanford is going to be a plus. however I do agree go check out the schools and talk to the students."  sbballer

See how inane such sweeping generalized statements sound like? You don't do Stanford any useful service; quite the opposite, you and sbballer are a huge disservice to the great institution that is Stanford. This is what I mean by embarrassing.

58.<<<sbballer>>>
btw.. all the above statements are True. times have changed:)

59.<<<TiggerDad>>>
"TiggerDad = Triggered Dad:)"

See what I mean? sbballer REPRESENTS Stanford. Think about what you guys are doing to Stanford. You don't raise it up; you tear it down by such a display of embarrassing behavior.

60.<<<CU123>>>
Stanford is the new leader because of two reasons 1. It's the only elite research university on the west coast (cal tech is too small to compete) thereby drawing by itself on a very large population. 2. It has decent weather. These two reasons will see Stanford dominate the HYP for a long time. All of these schools popularity are simply driven by population.

61.<<<sbballer>>>
Princeton is a fine school... Princeton parents however:)

62.<<<prezbucky>>>
I sometimes get caught up a little bit in these A vs. B threads and if the focus is on fit, i am generally fine with that -- unless I think a school is being misrepresented in terms of the fit variables.

When I hear peers being discussed and someone makes a sweeping statement like "A is better than B" it tends to tickle my trigger a bit. Ohhhh, reeeaaaalllly?! (hehe). That happened a little bit in this thread.

I realize it may sound like I don't like Stanford. I want to assure everyone that I do.

I am very sensitive -- well, CC-wise -- to people putting down Princeton and Yale as if they no longer belong on the top shelf.

They are still top-10 overall as universities; as respectable as that is, I will acknowledge that Stanford, Harvard and (maybe) MIT have surpassed them a bit as total universities due mainly to those three schools' expansive and top-rate grad programs, research output, etc. UChicago, Berkeley and Columbia are in the same neighborhood for their expansive all-level quality and diverse offerings as well. There's nothing wrong with that; it's proper.

What I bridle at is when people overlook the difference between overall U rep and undergraduate focus and quality. There, P and Y excel. I only hope to keep the focus on undergraduate quality and the overall undergrad experience, because that's what the vast majority of kids on here are asking about.

"Hey guys, I'm off to a college. Which college is best for me?" (not a Master's or PhD program; nor an MBA, med school, law school, etc.)

I don't think we should lose sight of that and, thus, we should answer them with undergraduate program quality and experience in mind -- and how they fit what the kids tell us about themselves -- not grad/research-fed international hype.

You might be wondering, then, why I don't put schools like Dartmouth and Brown -- both with even more undergrads proportionally than P or Y -- in this conversation. Well, I would if I felt they offered the same overall academic quality as HYPSM. The fact is, I don't. And academic quality is very important to me when evaluating a school. However, if you're discussing, say, Duke and Dartmouth, I certainly will be vocal about Dartmouth's undergrad focus.

So:
- Stanford is great
- So is Princeton (and Yale, and Harv...)
- Focus on the undergraduate experience at both (all) and choose based on fit and finances.

63.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@prezbucky - As always, a well-balanced contribution to CC. :)

64.<<<prezbucky>>>
Thank you, sir.

65.<<<Chrchill>>>
It is hard to ignore the trickle down effect that the key top professional schools -- Law, Medicine and Business --- have on a school and the undergrad division.

Only Harvard and Stanford are top 3 in each.
Followed by , UChicago and Penn with two top 5 (UChicago in Bus and Law; Penn in Business and Medicine)

Yale is tops in arts and music. Columbia and UChicago are very much its peer and in some areas ahead of Yale, and not just in sciences. (E.g, -- top English department is UChicago together with Berkeley. ) I am also not convinced at all that Yale has much more of an undergrad focus than Columbia, the "new" UChicago or Harvard. Princeton is a different story. Moreover, Yale has taken safe spaces and political correctness to the extremes of an Oberlin and Brown. This may appeal to some and not others.
I do agree that identifying the "best" is a silly endeavor. At these exalted levels, the intangibles, the gut feeling of where does student X feel more comfortable socially and otherwise are key.

66.<<<Multiverse7>>>
@TiggerDad If you disagree with the opinions expressed just voice your reasons why without resorting to ad hominem attacks. This country had enough of that last year and I'm dismayed and sorry that my previous post brought me down to that level for which I apologize.

I repeat that it is not surprising to find enthusiastic alumni or otherwise supporters of a school on the school's forum or in posts related to the school on other fora. I can't tell you the number of Yale alumni who constantly rave about Yale's Residential College system (and rightly so). I don't find it "embarrassing behavior" or otherwise.

67.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Multiverse7 - Points well taken. Would you make the same comments to sbballer who's been making ad hominem attacks? Your points would be more credible, then.

68.<<<gr8pl8>>>
Close family's son went to Harvard and graduated last year and was a speaker at graduation, rejected at Stanford his senior year. Awesome accomplishment, was valedictorian speaker at HS also. D had better stats but was rejected at Yale and waitlisted at Harvard. Accepted to Stanford and Columbia and bunch of other great schools. It basically comes down to the mood of the admit officer when they are reading the apps. Both friend's son and my D are English majors.

Most people know that at the level these students are at the admissions officers are choosing from are the top 2-3% of all high school students. Basically they are fighting for the same students. What fits one student and family situation vs another shifts the perspective of what universities are the best.

Here in the West Coast only Harvard matches Stanford. All the other IVY schools are second tier, but Harvard is second best to Stanford for us because Stanford students have so much more open core requirements and the freedom to chose from a wide variety of classes. The restrictions placed upon the classes they can choose from their first year is minimal. From what I have gathered, talking with friend's son, was that it is very structured at Harvard but very rewarding in terms of what he gained from the classes he was forced to take.

IMO. When the students are the cream of the crop and most if not all of them are really self motivated and they have proven themselves to be admitted to these awesome schools, the universities should be open, flexible and accommodating to them. Stanford has embraced that idea and that is the main reason they have overtaken the IVY so quickly, fifteen years ago we would not be having this conversation. UCB, Stanford, CalTech and Pomona were the top here and UCB was in the national conversation. From reading the changes happening at the IVY schools they are starting to emulate Stanford because they need to follow the leader and catch up or be left behind.

It is Harvard #1 and Stanford #1....the others are 3,4,5,6,7,8.....but Stanford slowly moving ahead and the #1 here on the West Coast for sure. HYP will be #1 in the East Coast for some time to come but they can hear the footsteps of change from the other innovative schools here on the West Coast. Can't stop progress.

69.<<<Multiverse7>>>
@sbballer @tigger10 @Penn95 and everyone - peace. We're all just trying to help others who need advice get the best advice they can.

I'm the college freshman here so I look to you all as adults to set the example and I will gladly follow.

They are all great schools and what's right for one person may not be right for another. Hopefully, we can help guide people to find the right fit for themselves especially if they can't visit before making a decision.

I love everything about Stanford but I'd be the first to admit that my sibling at Harvard belongs at Harvard and not Stanford.

70.<<<Multiverse7>>>
And does it REALLY matter who is #1 or perceived as #1? I was all set to go to Yale last year turning down both Harvard and Stanford and their reputed higher standings because I felt I could do great things at Yale. It was only the Admit weekend at Stanford (that ended the day before decisions were due) that I changed my mind because of the weather and, more importantly, the incredible students and faculty I met. It just felt like a place where I would be more happy at, and consequently, most likely perform better. It had nothing to do with rankings.

Rankings change, people age and die. In the end, it seems to me we should focus on what the important things in life are and less on the superficial. Just my humble opinion.

71.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Multiverse7 - Can't agree with you more. Well put. :)>-

72.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford is the only university that is top 3 in all disciplines.

engineering, law, business, medicine.

just some friendly trash talking:)

73.<<<slushy>>>
As a parent of a Princetonian and Stanford Cardinal, I have visited both campuses numerous times. Both schools have brought the best out of my DC, academically and otherwise. There's no overall "best" school (a relative term depending on the categories) - just "different strokes for different folks." It's a great privilege to attend any of these elite colleges SPHYM, etc. with their tremendous caliber of faculty and student body, resources, facilities, opportunities, and networks.

74.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@sbballer - don't you have homework?

75.<<<prezbucky>>>
Maybe we can find (further) unification in appreciating how lucky we are, as Americans, to be home to so many great schools -- not just these five, but the top 100+ universities and 100 LACs... at least.

There is such a variety of schools that, almost regardless of a kid's academic talent and fit interests, any kid who wants to learn has multiple options that will fit him(-er). Sometimes there are cost issues, but the price pays for the quality (generally speaking, IMO).

We should all unite under our flag and shout "USA! USA!..." Maybe Stanford's Olympic athletes and the kids at the academies could lead the cheer... :-)

76.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford is also the only one that can field a football team that can routinely beat USC

Fear the Tree:)

77.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
Well, that settles it, right? Anyone whose choice of college is driven by whether the football team can beat USC, you know what to do.

78.<<<Hoggirl>>>
^ I don't think there is anything wrong with factoring in a football program when choosing a school. It shouldn't be a *deciding* factor, but for those of us who love college football, it is understandable to have it as *a* factor.

Absolutely, everyone is entitled to choose a school base on what they are looking for. Be it the weather, the football team etc.

80.<<<Pasadenadad>>>

81.<<<collegedad13>>>
Choosing a school based upon a football team is illogical and ridiculous. You go to school to learn not to watch football. If you want to watch football you should subscribe to Directv . They have some great sports packages and they are cheap

82.<<<websensation>>>
Tell that to Duke or UCLA students. As much as both are great schools, sports teams help build certain types of school spirit. As long as they are not the main reasons for attending them, athletics do attract certain students and help build brand name as well. When I think of Duke or North Carolina, I automatically think of their basketball teams. No question Princeton attracts certain types of students and provides a great education.

Even my non sports oriented kid is looking forward to attending Stanford athletic events with his classmates and cheering them on etc. Athletics add to the fun of college imo and make Stanford more attractive.

I am also impressed that Stanford attracts great athletes who are good to great students. That just adds to the wow factor. The fact that Stanford has best athletic programs among HYPSM and even most state schools does help attract students.

IMO the fact that Stanford manages to excel in both academics and sports is a great achievement. Great athletes choose Stanford partly due to its academic prestige, and great students choose it partly due to the school spirit and pride that great athletic teams help engender.

83.<<<TiggerDad>>>
I agree that a part of college experience is sports. Making an entire college decision based on sports is immature at best, but sports is most definitely an integral aspect of the college culture that adds to the school lore. How can I forget the Big Game between Cal and Stanford! and the Beanpot Hockey tournament in Boston! Stanford certainly raises its students' spirits high with the stellar accomplishments in sports and undoubtedly helps raising its attractiveness to prospective students and the yield percentage. HYP, on the other hand, have the Ivy League that has its own attractiveness based on its old tradition. The Ivy League Conference games play a significant role in the students' college experiences. Whether a student chooses Stanford or HYP, I'm genuinely happy for that individual. We should all celebrate the hard earned accomplishment. Each college has its own strengths and weaknesses, and it's a matter of what kind of strengths the prospective student prefers and what kind of weaknesses that the student prefers to avoid. As repeated hundreds of times here on CC, it's ultimately a matter of an individual fit.

84.<<<websensation>>>
Agree @TiggerDad When I think of UCLA, I think of John Wooden, the great coach/mentor and the historical string of NCAA championship wins by Alcindor-led basketball team. Similarly, what students would not like to be associated with the Olympic gold medals gobbling swimmers at Stanford swimming teams?

As I said, even my un-athletic kid who will be going to Stanford said to me "I hope I can take a photo with Ledecky and Simone." I told him "You going to Stanford for that?" And he said "Well, how many kids can say he goes to school with Olympic gold medalists who dominated the swimming?" Hey, it's better than admiring some President's daughter for being the President's daughter. lol

No kidding. My D's friend is hoping to be roommates with Malia Obama, whereas my D is hoping to room someone completely different from her culturally and socioeconomically. Perhaps a Questbridge candidate or someone from a conservative (with an open mind) background, or yes, even a smart jock.

86.<<<websensation>>>
I hope my kid rooms with someone who doesn't stay up late and makes a lot of noise or snores. I told my kid to room with someone who doesn't snore and sleeps and wakes up at similar hours and is reasonably accommodating. Long time ago, I roomed with a kid who spent his entire day time with his group of friends, then came to our room and spent next 3 hours talking on the phone with the SAME group of friends with whom he just spent the entire day! I finally had enough and threatened to leave.

87.<<<sushiritto>>>
My D got to meet and take a pic with Christian McCaffrey last year when he came to her HS for some type of study his Stanford class was working on. And just moving about campus over the years, we've met plenty of athletes, including Andrew Luck and several future USNWT and USNMT players who now play professionally. So, I agree, depending on the kid, college sports can play a role in determining a school.

88.<<<collegedad13>>>
Being around a set of largely academically inferior Neanderthals who in many cases believe the rape and harassment laws were not meant to apply to them was never something me or my kids valued in an academic surrounding. I think there are thousands of good reasons to go to Stanford but being around Andrew Luck types is not one of them. Being around Malia Obama is a good reason to go to her school

89.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford is proud of its athletes and its geeks...

91.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
[quote]Ivies have long looked down at athletics and engineering. (although that's changing no doubt in part due to Stanford's rise)[/quote]

News flash: the Ivy League is an athletic conference. Its members, which each recruit 180 - 200 athletes per year, agreed the rules of American football more than 140 years ago, before Stanford was founded. The oldest intercollegiate sporting event in the United States is the Harvard-Yale Regatta, which began in 1852. Ivy League athletic teams compete at a high level, and occasionally win national championships, without recourse to athletic scholarships.

Don't, in response, deluge me with statistics or assertions purporting to prove how much better Stanford's athletics are - that's not the point. The issue is that in your zeal to promote Stanford, you say many things that are untrue.

I realize it's futile to attempt to correct every egregious error you post, @sbballer, but I feel some responsibility to high school students who might not know that everything they read from you should be checked before it's believed.

92.<<<TiggerDad>>>

Same here. It's the feeling of responsibility to high school students that I had to respond to sbballer's posts. It's unfortunate that he decided to take on the unofficial (and probably very unwelcome) role of a Stanford ambassador. Stanford is a great institution, no doubt, and its reputation shouldn't be besmirched by someone who acts like a drunken frat boy.

93.<<<prezbucky>>>
Some of my favorite memories from college are from UW football games I attended and the "game day" atmosphere. Back then student season tickets (home games) were like $40 and between the awesome band, student section antics, the traditions and pageantry and the game itself, Badger football games are/were a blast. Best ticket in town.

For some kids, a rah-rah sports atmosphere is a big plus.

94.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@stanfordfoodie the problem with that argument is that it's dependent on an assumption that there's a very large overlap among the students HYPS admit. Let's look at the numbers.

Stanford and Princeton admitted 2,050 and 1,890 students respectively this year. We'll assume you're right and Stanford wins 75% of its cross-admits with Princeton (Parchment suggests it's 66-78% at a 95% confidence interval, but whatever). The question is: how many students were actually cross-admitted?

I'm going to guess maybe 500, and likely far fewer, after you knock out the athletes, legacies and other hooked candidates particular to each of the two schools, and adjust for the fact that many kids won't apply to Stanford or Princeton because they prefer the other coast, they don't like something about one of the two schools, they got in early to one and didn't apply anywhere else, or for any other reason. As well, it goes without saying that some number of students are admitted to Stanford and denied by Princeton, and vice versa. They've both got single-digit admit rates and non-identical institutional needs and preferences, and having 30-40k applicants increases the randomness inherent in the process, so many applicants won't get into both.

Accordingly, out of the 500 overlapping students, we can assume that maybe 350 went to Stanford and 150 went to Princeton, for a net difference of 200 - and Stanford and Princeton have class sizes of roughly 1,525 and 1,350 students respectively. So what you're saying is that because roughly one out of seven Princeton students is supposedly taking the place of someone Princeton would rather have had but went to Stanford, for any number of reasons, Princeton has lower-quality students and inferior talent relative to Stanford. That doesn't seem justified by the facts.

The case is weakened further by the fact that Stanford and Princeton assume they're going to have yields of roughly 80% and 70%. Each of them overadmits in the expectation that they're going to lose many candidates - and not just to each other. The 30% of its admits that Princeton expects to lose end up going to Harvard, Yale, MIT and various other schools as well as Stanford. The 20% of its admits that Stanford loses enroll at Harvard, Yale, MIT and other schools, including Princeton. Stanford and Princeton both get a substantial majority of those they admit - i.e., those they want - and no one school in particular is beating them, whatever the cross-admit stats say.

It would be more accurate to assert that there's a pool of top-quality candidates that the tippy-top schools generally divide among themselves, losing some to schools outside the magic circle.

95.<<<nevrgiveup>>>
[quote]I defined talent, broadly speaking, as whomever Stanford and HYP compete for.[/quote]

Huh? That seems to say that if HYPS is not interested in you, you are somehow less talented? That is a very strange definition of talent. specially because they all have their own institutional needs and strategy and recruit based on that. Holistic admission pays a lot of attention not just to current achievements but also to "future potential" and it is really difficult to determine future potential of an applicant in a 5-10 minute application read. Venture capitalists spend more time evaluating each start up than these universities spend evaluating each application and even those VC's fail to recognize winners and invest in duds many times. To think that a bunch of young application readers can sniff out real talent from a pool of $30K+ applicants by devoting 5-10 minutes to an application is being very optimistic.

Getting into these top schools, does not say a whole lot about your talent. I am not even sure what it says about you anymore.

However, I care very little about whether he got in or didn't get in because students get accepted to HYPSM in very different ways and routes, so I don't really care whether it's fair or not fair. The college wanted to admit him, so they did.

Oops, I am beating this dead horse again. I really have to STOP. lol

101.<<<bluewater2015>>>
@DeepBlue86, I think you're probably pretty close in your analysis. The numbers released a few years ago from Stanford faculty senate minutes showed 214 cross-admits with Harvard, 155 with Princeton and 184 with Yale. I believe the methodology is such that the total number of people is less than 214 + 155 + 184 = 553 as some were admitted to more than one of HYP as well as Stanford.

So most Stanford admits were not admitted to any of HYP, and likely the same is true for those other schools as well (most were admitted to only one of that group). To your point, with high yield rates for all, mathematically there can't be that many cross admits.

102.<<<ewho>>>
A few years back, before H and P resumed early admisson, about 43% of Stanford's admits were HYPSM cross-admits (more than a 1000), and Stanford won 52% of those cross-admits. 1/3 of Stanford students are those cross-admits.

103.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I'd like to see a source for those figures, @ewho. Even if it were true, though, today HYPS each have yields of 70-80%. They admit overlapping but very different cohorts of applicants, and each of them lands the vast majority of those they admit. Go where you feel most comfortable, if you're in the small minority that's fortunate enough to be admitted to more than one; you're probably going to do just as well at whichever you pick (and parsing which has a slightly better department in this or that area is by and large a waste of time).

104.<<<Penn95>>>
@DeepBlue86 While I agree that splitting hairs between HYPS is not really meaningful, the kids admitted to more than one of these tend to be very competitive and prestige-conscious. There is a reason for example most Harvard -Yale cross admits turn down Yale for Harvard.

Personally I would be very interested to see a recent HYPS cross-admit split. Any knows if there is any data out there for the classes of 2019 or 2020 ?

105.<<<ewho>>>
@DeepBlue86 I'm the source. :)

@Penn95 the info about the HYPSM cross-admits is highly guarded, I believe. The info for the schools themselves can be easily obtained : all they have to do is to send each other the lists of admits and matriculates in October. No abuse of stats here since it is the population data.

For us to guess, it is fairly difficult to figure out the pie problem with only partial info. The yield of cross-admits should be partially associated with the overall yield, relatively. I am so sick to figure this thing out again since my original analysis. But I'm confident that stanford's yield of cross-admit is higher now than it was before, simply by looking at the overall yield.

107.<<<Penn95>>>
@ewho that makes sense. My guess would be that Stanford now is about neck and neck with Harvard (like 50-50 to 45-55 in favor of either), wins by a bit over Yale (maybe 40-60), and wins substantially over Princeton and MIT (30-70 or more). Also the parchment match-up data d not tell the whole story since they include data from all the previous years i think.

108.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@Penn95 - yes, they're kids, often with prestige-conscious parents. Is the point to attempt to measure which school is more prestigious than another? If so, good luck and have fun. As I think most will concede, the education, grad school admission or job a kid gets is going to be far more dependent on who they are than which of these four tippy-top schools they went to. In any case, we don't have the data to support such an analysis.

As the author of that article states, now that HYPS all have SCEA, the number of cross-admits of Stanford with any one school is no more than a couple of hundred or so, and often much less (and I agree with him - I don't know where they could reliably have got that data unless the admissions offices are - probably illegally - sharing names).

Does anyone (apart from Stanford administrators and fans who are keen for Stanford to be seen as at least equal to Harvard) really care if something like 200 admitted to both Stanford and Harvard, out of more than 3,800 admitted to Stanford and/or Harvard, chose one or the other? Does that say anything meaningful about the relative prestige of either school, when both get 80% yields?

I think one of the commenters on that article poses an interesting question regarding geographic preferences. It seems intuitively true to me that East Coasters will generally prefer HYP (and split their preferences among those three schools) and West Coasters will generally prefer Stanford, but it would be interesting to see the data for cross-admits segmented geographically. I'll bet it would show that geographical location is much more important than relative "prestige" among HYPS, but I'd revise my opinion if Stanford could be shown to be handily winning cross-admits to HYP from New England and the Mid-Atlantic states.

[quote]@CA94309 @hebegebe You might not agree with how he chose to respond to the essay prompt, but you can't deny that that kid has some serious accomplishments under his belt. Stanford (and Yale and Princeton) would not have admitted him if he didn't. I don't understand why people are so annoyed with someone taking a risk and the risk paying off[/quote]

.No, I don't know what his accomplishment are, so I cannot deny or confirm anything. Neither does anyone who has not read his application or don't know him personally, so all of us are guessing here. Pretty much all of what has been written about his essay suggests that he should not have been admitted. The is coming from the left (HuffPo) and right (National Review). Only enthusiastic Stanford parents on CC seem to think otherwise.

No one except the Admission Committee knows why he was admitted - maybe he was admitted because of the essay, maybe it was because he was very qualified and this essay did not matter, or maybe because of his wealthy family, or for some other reason.

We are not annoyed, I think you are the one who seemed to be annoyed.

The yield rates in the past several years:

Regardless where did the admits come from in the past several years, assumed that the schools have not changed their preferences in admitting the types of students, the relative changes in yield indicate that something has happening. The surging interests in CS/AI might have contributed to the changes, especially for those full-pay academic students who are interested in the next new things. Where to spend $70,000/year and what to study are the big questions. It is either to build the next AI things or to waste time to deal with the brown-noise markets while we have the pink-noise minds?

You replied:
[quote]I was the author and I never said that, not back then and not now.[/quote]

But, unless I'm misreading, you speculated exactly that in your comment to your own post:
[quote]The numbers of cross-admits are more interesting since every one of HYPSM has SCEA now, and the total cross-admits should be reduced significantly, compared with Class of 2014.

My initial guess of the numbers of cross-admits, if I read the labels of the chart correctly, is:

with Harvard:
Year 2014: 214
Year 2010: 345 (from my original post for class of 2014)

with Yale:
Year 2014: 184
Year 2010: 214

with Princeton:
Year 2014: 155
Year: 2010: 254

with MIT:
Year 2014: 177
Year 2010: 218[/quote]

Clearly, Stanford's yield has increased significantly over the past few years - and I would guess that interest in CS/AI has a lot to do with it. I think, though, that there has to be a natural ceiling on it. Unless S comes to be perceived as unquestionably dominant over H and all other schools, in all fields, so dominant that this trumps the geographical issue I referenced, there will always be some cross-admits who will choose HYP and others, for any number of reasons. Each school could raise its yield a bit more by moving to ED and admitting a lot of their classes that way, but that hurts the schools in other ways, by limiting the candidates they get a look at, so I doubt they'll go there.

I have no view on "brown noise" or "pink noise"...

@TiggerDad I don't think you should engage in a debate of maturity with an undergrad, as you aren't showing maturity in your posts. I am not sure what you are contributing to this discussion as you actually don't have any experience at these schools either. Maybe you should reflect on the humbleness of those you admire.

117.<<<websensation>>>
@arbitrary99 I agree as to your "Neanderthals" post. As to TiggerDad posts, I do think certain posts that keep hyping Stanford over other great schools does disservice to Stanford rather than help Stanford. My goodness, there are many great schools in US, depending on your fit.

118.<<<arbitrary99>>>
@websensation I think TiggerDad's are more self congratulatory than informative in tone.

I know these schools quite well, and there isn't a bad choice of course. They are so different that the personal fit should be obvious. I know both humble and not so humble graduates of each. When it gets to graduate school, there is no difference between the best of each.

119.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
Thanks, Mathacle / @ewho...

On another point, I agree that if H and S each admit a little over 2,000 kids, and 200 of them are cross-admits (i.e., roughly 10% of the admits to each), the question of whether 40%, 50% or 60% of cross-admits (representing 4% - 5% - 6% of total admits to either H or S) choose the other school can only be of interest to certain people associated with H or S.

Such folks would consider a rise from 50% to 60% of cross-admits to be a victory, but we're talking about a spread of 20 kids - comprising four or so freshman suites, maybe a quarter of one entryway in Harvard Yard - in a class of about 1,675.

120.<<<websensation>>>
@arbitrary99 I run across situations like this frequently. Student A's "dream" college was Princeton but she got rejected or waitlisted by Princeton but accepted by Yale, Harvard or Stanford (or some other combo); and Student B's "dream" school was Stanford but she got rejected or waitlisted by Stanford but accepted to Yale, Harvard or Princeton (or some combo). In such a case, I always think such students should be able to switch their acceptances so both can go to their "dream" schools. Pity.

I agree 100%. There's a sexual harassment problem that pervades all walks of society. And the news of the last week or two should confirm that point. Additionally, the UC system, Cal specifically, has had some issues in this area as well. There are bad apples everywhere, not just sports.

The time period (2012-16) that you quote during which Stanford's yield increased relatively faster than its peers, roughly coincides with the dramatic increase in CS major enrollments and applicants all over the US. When it comes to cross admits interested in CS, Stanford will win hands down against HYP (and even MIT). Even Berkeley EECS which had a 20% admit rate until 2012 saw its acceptance rates fall to an estimated 4.5 % this year. At the same time, at Stanford, CS majors which was historically at 5% of the class has now grown to 25%. The surging interest in CS skews the data for Stanford. As anyone involved in CS knows that tech goes through boom and bust cycles, yields and cross admits for Stanford will shift with the changes popularity of CS.

123.<<<CU123>>>
Personally I think Stanford is a juggernaut that will hold the top place for a long time, why you ask? It has two things none of its peers have.

1. Location - only top 10 school out west
2. Climate - only top 10 school with a temperate climate.

While I think these things are ridiculously unimportant to get a top education, they are important to teenagers.

124.<<<2018dad>>>
^^ You forgot CalTech.

125.<<<CU123>>>
I said top 10, and even if I included them, what is there freshman class ~ 250, not a significant player and almost strictly an engineering school.

126.<<<Penn95>>>
^ Caltech is actually a top 10 school. just because this year it was not ranked in the top 10 it doesn't mean that it isn't really a top 10 school. if you look at the long term past usnews rankings (last couple of decades), it definitely is. Besides no on takes the year to year variations o the usnews rankings that literally.

I agree that it is rather small though so it doesn't affect Stanford that much.

127.<<<CU123>>>
OK I'll qualify it.......USNWR........top 10.........this year, but I think you get the gist of what I am saying. 8-|

128.<<<Penn95>>>
@CA94309 Tech is the future and that will not change, yes it goes though boom and bust cycles, but that won't really affect yields and cross admits for Stanford that much. Especially since Stanford's top in all fields, tech, non-tech STEM fields and also social sciences and humanities.

129.<<<CU123>>>
It will soon be Stanford, then HYP with a good size gap, if its not that way already, and I'm not a Stanford nor a HYP sycophant. I'm just reading the tea leaves.

130.<<<Chrchill>>>
Harvard is still and remains the gold standard. It has more money than most countries and by about ten billion more than Stanford. Stanford is and will remain the honorable mention second.

131.<<<CU123>>>
Its a matter of time before Harvard is relegated to number two if not already. Things never stay the same. They're already winning the acceptance % game and the cross admit game (which is really telling). In fact they would probably be ranked #1 in USNWR except for there 4 yr grad rate (a pitiful 75%) which is probably due to the DIV 1 athletes they recruit. BTW, they should be dinged for that grad rate, recruit athletes that want to graduate!

132.<<<Penn95>>>
^Harvard has the centuries-old established prestige, Stanford has the momentum and also the advantage of being strong in every single field and being seen as the future. But it will take decades and decades until Stanford is totally equal to Harvard in terms of lay prestige (i.e. for the general population). These things take very long to change. Harvard has had centuries sitting at the very top and its status as such has been ingrained in public consciousness. While Stanford is arguably an overall stronger university than Harvard, for now it remains slightly below Harvard in the general public's consciousness and perception in terms of prestige.
But there is no question about it that the top two universities in the country (and the world) are Harvard and Stanford.

133.<<<CA94309>>>
@Penn95 Tech was the future in 2000 also when the last time tech bubble burst. CS enrollments dropped so dramatically. that it caused a lot of panic in the academia around the mid 2000's.The next tech bubble will happen at which time enrollments in CS/Engineering will fall. Stanford cannot win the cross admit battle against HY (and maybe P) for the non-engineering sciences and the humanities. In fact if you look at the 2006-2007 numbers CS majors were about 4 % and Engineering about 13 % of the undergrad population, the yield that year was 67%.

Stanford's location has not changed in the last 10 years, neither has has its weather (as far I can tell at least) so that can't be a factor. The population shift towards the west, assuming that Stanford's admits' geo distribution changed accordingly, could have made a difference, but that would not be significant.

134.<<<Chrchill>>>
@penn95. We agree on the top two. One of the reasons for that is that Harvard and Stanford are the only universities with top three medical, law and business schools.
UChicago follows with two in the top four (business and law) followed by Penn with two in the top five (business and medicine)

[quote]Harvard is still and remains the gold standard.[/quote]
[quote]Its a matter of time before Harvard is relegated to number two if not already.[/quote]

What these statements from two different posters have in common is that they're entirely evidence-free, and prove nothing, because "the gold standard", and "number one/two" are just the authors' perception of some nebulous concept of prestige.

Honestly, why bother arguing about something no one can prove? Both schools have low single-digit admit rates and ~80% yields, which means, as shown upthread, that they're largely admitting different subsets of top-tier candidates. Yale and Princeton have nearly as low admit rates and ~70% yields, indicating that they too are admitting relatively few candidates in common. If you spend enough time on CC, you'll come to believe that lots and lots of kids are admitted to two, three or four of these schools, but it isn't supported by the numbers. As demonstrated earlier, the difference between Stanford winning 50% and 60% of cross-admits from Harvard is maybe 20 kids out of a class of 1,675. I don't think if that happens Harvard will be convinced that it's America's new second choice.

I think if we had fuller data it would become clear that the principal determinant is geography; what we know is that 36% of Stanford students are from California and I would guess close to 50% are from the West Coast overall (<url>http://facts.stanford.edu/academics/undergraduate-profile</url>), while 39% of current Harvard freshmen are from New England or the Mid-Atlantic states and only 17% are from the "Pacific" region (<url>https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/admissions-statistics</url>). Each of Stanford and Harvard is getting top students, but each gets a subset skewed toward its home region.

The real story here, in my opinion, is that because (i) Stanford has established itself as a clear peer of HYP and consequently has distanced itself from its relatively limited regional competition, and (ii) Stanford is strong in CS/engineering which is hot right now, many fewer top West Coast students are crossing the country to go to HYP these days and a few more from the East Coast are turning down HYP to go to Stanford - both of which could change. These schools are ultimately all just different flavors of the same super-premium ice cream.

137.<<<Penn95>>>
@CA94309 Not even close. Of course Stanford can win the cross-admit battles for the non-engineering sciences against HYP, especially Yale and Princeton. Stanford has definitely stronger sciences departments than Yale and Princeton, and especially Yale. Also it has just as strong or in some cases stronger humanities and social sciences. Plus not all engineering disciplines are that related to tech anyway.

The tech boom has enabled Stanford to rise up in prominence and challenge Harvard but because Stanford is strong across the board that rise in prominence will not be reversed even if there is a tech bust. Stanford is not a tech school, it is an all around leading research university that got an extra boost from the tech boom and was able to rise organically out of Harvard's shadow because it offers something new. On the other hand Yale and Princeton are and prob will remain in Harvard's shadow because they are too similar and have nothing drastically different/better to offer.

Also equating what is happening now in tech to the craze back in 2000 it is not really apples to apples.

138.<<<CU123>>>

I do wonder if the rapid increase in CS majors at Stanford in recent years (a trend that is also evident at other schools, though maybe not to the same degree, and especially not at state schools that cap the major) has the potential to dilute the job market perception of the undergraduate CS degree over time. No doubt those CS majors are all really smart people, but many of them would have majored in HumBio or Econ or some other field in the not too distant past and in some cases their interests and skills are probably a better fit for other fields.

Ridiculous debate to compare H and S :

1) Most applicants DO NOT HAVE THE CHOICE, you are lucky if you get into one of these.
So why compare them, not like shopping for a car. The one you get admission should be compared
to your other options

2) Undergrad experience, I have had friends at all these schools when I was a student, and now as a parent, know kids currently in all these schools. Yale has by far the most undergraduate friendly program, kids who go to Yale LOVE IT.
I think Brown has a similar level of undergraduate satisfaction. Harvard and Stanford may be prestigious, but you don't eat prestige day to day for 4 years.

3) If famous graduates would cause one to attend, Cornell has a current Supreme Court justice, and former Atty General, both women. Future female lawyers should go to Cornell undergrad (which gets them into Harvard Law apparently). Commissioners of the NHL and MLB both went to Cornell undergrad before Harvard Law, so future male attorneys should consider Cornell undergrad for a future in law ! Cornell is not even in this convo, but above Chicago and Michigan was added to the discussion to make this point. HYPS does not produce all the accomplished people in society. And the most famous tech examples from Harvard are drop outs, so what does that say about the value of the Harvard education, to them ?

143.<<<Chrchill>>>
@DeepBlue86 your evidence based obsessions miss the mark. Prestige and market differentiation are inherent subjective, fuzzy and fluid.

144.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I think @JamesVanc and @bluewater2015 have put their fingers on something, which is that it can be appropriate to compare S to the Ivies as a whole, or to HYP as a subgroup, given location and history.

I think of it this way: imagine there's a town, and three restaurants within a mile or two of each other (call them Harry's, Yvonne's and Peter's) open to serve it. Over time, the town grows and the restaurants expand, with smaller, newer restaurants opening up. It's generally acknowledged that the original three are tops in town (Harry's, in particular, is the oldest and largest, and many believe it to be the best), but each has its fans, who point to specific menu items that they believe their preferred restaurant does better than any of the others.

Meanwhile, the town is now a city and has been expanding westward. A rich man living on the western edge thinks his neighbors should be able to get a top meal, prepared somewhat differently, without having to drive across town, so he opens Stan's. As the population in the western part of the city grows, the quality of Stan's improves, to the point that now most people in the town think it has four great restaurants.

People in the western part of the city are now really keen to eat at Stan's, because it's in their neighborhood and is finally in the same class as the three that they'd have to drive across town for. Seafood's also trendy now, and Stan's is especially renowned for how they prepare it. All four of the top restaurants are roughly the same size, but because Stan's is the only one in the western part of the city, which has been growing faster than the eastern half, and because seafood is so popular now, it's getting more reservation requests than even Harry's, and some seafood fans from the eastern part of the city are now willing to drive for miles to eat at Stan's (even though Harry's, Yvonne's and Peter's all prepare some pretty good seafood too).

Fans of Stan's say that this proves that Stan's is clearly the best restaurant in the city, and there are impassioned debates on Restaurant Confidential where they argue: See? Stan's is now the most popular by far! And in the future, everyone will be eating seafood! Stan's is now definitely more prestigious than Harry's, let alone Yvonne's or Peter's!

The restaurant critics, though, know that the town has four great restaurants.

145.<<<arbitrary99>>>
These debates about which school historically has produced more presidents or billionaires etc are just ridiculous.

So is trying to decide whether one school has a better undergrad component than another. Undergrads don't touch the depth of the programs at these schools, and the ability of the upper classman to access the grad programs is available as well. It's only when selecting a PhD program that the faculty prominence and specialization becomes a factor.

As to geographical skews, that isn't necessarily created by the preference of students to stay local but rather the admit percentages are also skewed (look at how many NJ admits Princeton has for example). Why? The power of legacies is one reason.

I feel most of these responses come from people that actually haven't attended these schools, or are stuck in a "mine's better" debate.

146.<<<arbitrary99>>>
If you are fortunate to have gotten in to one of these schools, that's amazing. it's also only the first step in a journey. The difference between them is less than the difference the motivation of the students to make use of the great opportunities within the campus creates.

Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates would have been successful no matter which school they went to.

I wouldn't have any issue attending any of those four. To have a choice is a high class problem.

147.<<<Penn95>>>
@JamesVanc The entire thing you posted is wrong.

For the number of undergrad billionaires it is:
1. Penn
2.Harvard
3. Yale
4. USC
5.Stanford
5. Cornell
5. Princeton

Wall street and finance/business are not the same: While you will find way more HYP, Penn and Columbia people east, Stanford dominates business on the west (most major banks have branches in silicon valley and also top PE firms and VCs are located in Sillicon Valley). Most Stanford people choose to stay west.

[quote]@DeepBlue86 your evidence based obsessions miss the mark. Prestige and market differentiation are inherent subjective, fuzzy and fluid.[/quote]

Indeed, @Chrchill, which is why I think arguing about them is a waste of time, and I prefer discussions based on verifiable facts. I look forward, for example, to digging into this year's UChicago admissions statistics, assuming they're ever released.

Billionaires ranking in Tech-Startup area (undergrad)
1) Bill Gates (Harvard)
2) Jeff Bezos (Princeton)
3) Mark Zukerberg (Harvard)
4) Larry Ellison (Chicago)
5) Larry Page ( Michigan)
6) Sergey Brinn (Maryland)
7) Steve Ballmer (Harvard)
8) Michael Dell
9) Paul Allen
Dustin Moskovitz(Harvard)
Eric Schmidt(Princeton)

None of theses top high tech billionaires are from Stanford undergrad ???? I thought Stanford is known for strong high tech engineering/computer science programs and entrepreneurial mindset. Can anyone explain ? Who is the most successful Stanford undergrad in High-tech startup area ?

151.<<<CU123>>>
1 billion is a high bar, I imagine if you went with a $100M you would see a better presence of Stanford grads.

@arbitrary99 - I wrote a response that touched on your geographic skew point, and deleted half of it accidentally. My point was that the high NJ component at Princeton, similar to the high CA component at Stanford, supports my view that the cross-admit discussion doesn't reveal much because these schools are largely admitting different groups of students and the numbers of cross-admits are relatively small. I think, too, that, in addition to legacies (and although some Princeton legacies live in NJ, I would guess most don't), there are also fac brats, and, more importantly, students from local high schools well known to the admissions offices, who often prefer to stay in the area.

[quote]Also equating what is happening now in tech to the craze back in 2000 it is not really apples to apples.[/quote]

@Penn95 How so ? And how do you know the tech bust will not affect Stanford's numbers ?. I just showed you that when tech/CS was down Stanford's yield was down in par with YPM. I think your arguments are getting a bit stale by now.

Quoting @bluewater2015
[quote][The increase in CS enrollments] has the potential to dilute the job market perception of the undergraduate CS degree over time. No doubt those CS majors are all really smart people, but many of them would have majored in HumBio or Econ or some other field in the not too distant past and in some cases their interests and skills are probably a better fit for other fields.[/quote]

Yes, well said, it is already happening at Stanford. There are many in CS who do not have the skills, but are doing CS because of peer and/or parental pressure. It is quite a struggle for these kids. Like Stanford, Y and P don't admit to a major, but they require those interested in CS/Engineering to take SAT subject tests in Math 2 and a science (Physics) to demonstrate skills that will ensure success. Though not fool proof it does serve as a check.

154.<<<Penn95>>>
@CA94309 lol you don't seem to get it...i never said a tech bust would not affect the Stanford numbers at all, but it would not affect it a lot since Stanford is top in all fields in addition to tech and it has come to establish itself as the new dream school in the country and the only real competition for Harvard.

The 2006-2007 data you gave are a decade old .They also show that Stanford's yield (67%) was similar to Princeton (68%) and slightly lower than Yale (70%).
Since then Stanford's yield has shot to 82%, while Yale and Princeton's have remained the same. A lot of it had to do with the rise of silicon valley, but if Stanford was not top across the board it would just be seen as a top STEM school like Caltech, and not as one 2 dream schools in the country and the world along with Harvard.

As I said the tech boom enabled Stanford to break out of playing second fiddle to Harvard. The fact that Stanford is an overall top university (much stronger overall than Yale and Princeton, and as strong/slightly stronger than Harvard). will enable it to keep its status even in the event of a tech bust.

You honestly think that most Stanford people who are admitted do not have subject tests? Making it officially mandatory and actually expect candidates to have it it for admission are two separate things.
Also people flocking to CS is a world-wide phenomenon, it is natural for many people to get attracted to the hot thing right now. CS enrollment has increased in most schools.

@JamesVanc
Most of these guys are all older, they were undergrads many decades ago. But do you think it is a coincidence that many/most of them went to Stanford for grad school and that is where they actually met their partners and started building their business?(Their undergrad sschool had much less to do with their success than Stanford). If you actually look at what undergrad schools have the most successful entrepreneurial activity now Stanford comes on top. To reach the level of success these guys have it takes decades and decades.

155.<<<JamesVanc>>>
[quote]Most of these guys are all older, they were undergrads many decades ago.[/quote]

The following founders are not that old, and still none of them are Stanford undergrads.

@DeepBlue86 from has now been confirmed numerous times from Nodorf and others, it is clear that UChicago admissions rate will be about same or a touch better than last year. YIeld will be materially better. Test scores the best ever. From what I have been told, they want to release precise numbers. Final yield will not be known until Kate summer and there are always folks who get off waitlist elsewhere and don't show.

159.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@Chrchill I've heard what's been stated orally about the headline numbers, but I'm particularly interested in how many kids applied and were admitted in each of the EA/ED/RD rounds - we'll see if they disclose that. I'm not sure they're going to want to confirm, as many suspect, that they filled two-thirds to three-quarters of the class in the ED rounds, and that the odds of getting in ED were 10x those of RD. I guess for now they're saying they can't release their app returns because they're under audit...;-)

160.<<<Chrchill>>>
@DeepBlue86 Unlike the President, they never mentioned ... audit. The math mavens here should be able to reverse engineer numbers pretty well. Here is what we know
28-29, 000 total apps
9 perfect EA and ED1 acceptance rate from 11-13,000 applications.
2 percent RD acceptance

Stanford and Silicon Valley is the envy or the world and the model university that is the gold standard other universities are emulating... including Cambridge, MIT, Texas and Harvard.

Stanford pioneered the close ties with industry... the first university industrial park in the country.. close collaboration with VC (sand hill road).

@Penn95 I don't think you have made your case. Stanford was an elite school even in 2006. Anyway it is time to move on.

165.<<<prezbucky>>>
I don't think relative grad-level strength is transferable to the undergraduate level -- if you have the #4 master's program in English, for instance, that does not mean that you are top-10 in English at the undergrad level -- but I think it does mean that the undergrad program is probably at least decent. But that's as far as I will go in using grad rankings to predict undergraduate program quality.

(I would also say that the lack of a high ranking at the grad level does not necessarily mean that the undergrad version sucks...)

At the undergrad level, what sets these schools apart are the following, IMO:

- Academic bread and butter/bell cow: Which two or three programs are most famous/important to the school? Which programs get funded first and bring in the most investments? You can't emphasize everything. At Stanford I would imagine it's CS and Engineering; at Princeton, maybe Physics and Econ; at Yale, maybe English and Classics; at Harvard, maybe History and Math (?). These are the things the schools emphasize, what they take the most pride in, and what they will fight hardest to maintain greatness in.

- Undergrad emphasis. I've written enough on this already. Which does the school serve more, grads or undergrads? That has far-reaching implications, from who gets the research spots, to whom the top profs teach, to whom the trustees actually care about and cater to most. Is it a place for research primarily, or a place for professional schools primarily, or a place for undergraduates primarily? Who's the top priority?

- Environment/weather

- Food/Dorms

- Academic and career support

- Research opportunities (as applicable)

- Student-prof interaction (may be differences in the frequency or depth of interaction)

- Social vibe

- Academic calendar

- Majors and courses available

- Distribution requirements

- Cost/Fin Aid

In other words, it's the usual fit variables. That's how kids should choose among these, or any other, schools at the undergraduate level. Nobody is going to exhaust any subject's knowledge as an undergrad, so grad/PhD level reputations and resources should not be of primary concern.

166.<<<Penn95>>>
@CA94309

Of course Stanford was an elite school in 2006, as it was in 1996 and 1986. And of course Yale and Princeton are super elite schools and also were in the past. But that doesn't mean that they do not live in Harvard's shadow in many ways.
But In the past 1-2 decades Stanford has broken out of that, and has come to challenge Harvard in ways that Yale or Princeton never have, Harvard has never felt insecure towards YP, because it bests them in virtually all metrics. But that cannot be said about Stanford.
Examples:

There goes the neighborhood - when the whatever-or-whoever-he-is called sbballer searches on "Stanford" and finds a thread, all meaningful discussion comes to an end, elbowed out by cheerleading in English beneath the level of a Stanford student and obviously false statements. The one in this case:
[quote]Stanford is now the gold standard of universities... No one says hey how can we be like H...or YP or an ivy...[/quote]
If Stanford didn't care about where they stood relative to HYP, their faculty senate wouldn't be publishing and debating their numbers of HYP cross-admits, as analyzed by Mathacle / @ewho (see upthread).

@Penn95: asserting the same thing over and over won't change any minds, tbh. At this point, nothing new is being said here.

168.<<<websensation>>>
As long as Stanford remains one of the top 10 prestigious colleges, I think their West coast location and nicer weather will continue to attract many West, East, in-between regions and international students. I will concern myself with Stanford's reputation when the acronym HYPSM changes to HYPM. I do have a feeling though that Stanford's rep will continue to grow due to its land size and growing endowments.

169.<<<sbballer>>>
SMHYP.... nuff said. new world

170.<<<prezbucky>>>
...not for undergrad. Princeton and Yale are every bit as good, possibly better, for undergraduate education (as/than HMS), based on prof interaction and undergraduate emphasis. (especially Princeton)

And Chicago may join the quintet if they ever get around to offering an Engineering program...

Happy to admit I'm wrong, if you can prove it.

172.<<<websensation>>>
Lol sbballer. Yes, for undergrad, academic quality wise, I would say there are around 20 schools which can claim they are one of the best in certain programs -- I agree with that. Since I have not attended all of those colleges during similar times, what I heard from others is my guide. I heard great things about Harvard,Columbia, Chicago, Brown, Princeton, Yale, Rice, Stanford, MIT, CalTech, Cornell, Georgetown, Williams, Swarthmore, Amherst, Pomona, Clare-McKenna, Harvey-Mudd etc.

For what it's worth, I went to a college seminar where recent graduates from Yale, Stanford and Princeton comprised the panel, and I was most impressed by a Yale graduate. I found the Stanford graduate guy boring. I then went to another presentation and was highly impressed by one Brown graduate who delivered a very effective presentation on Brown.

Actually, the worst tour guide was a Stanford tour guide (an exception I believe) also, but my kid still going to Stanford. It just goes to show you you shouldn't make a decision based one or two people you meet from certain schools. Lol

173.<<<collegedad13>>>
It is interesting that many of posters compare schools based upon how white males do financially. Why doesn't some one do a list with women or minorities only? Also the whole world does not revolve around CS!

174.<<<hebegebe>>>
I am not a white male, and from what I can tell, there is nothing in these posts that is specific to white males.

175.<<<CU123>>>
@websensation you can hardly judge a university by a single encounter with one graduate. [-(

176.<<<collegedad13>>>
There is nothing specific as to white males except all the names posted above. Take a look at post 152 for example. I think white males are roughly one third of this country. What do the schools do for women and minorities and the other two thirds of the country???

177.<<<bluewater2015>>>
It wasn't that long ago that Stanford's biggest rival was Berkeley, not just in sports but to a large extent academically as well. Still true for many graduate programs but not as much anymore at the undergraduate level. And likewise HYP I believe historically saw each other as their primary rivals.

In addition to the enhanced status of Silicon Valley, as discussed above, I think another aspect is Stanford's decision about 10 years ago to substantially increase financial aid. Prior to that there were a good number of admits who went somewhere else, especially Berkeley, for financial reasons.

Now the situation is reversed, and for many admits (though obviously not the full pay ones), Stanford is cheaper on a net basis than anywhere except HYP, which are the only other schools with endowments per student that are comparable.

On the endowment per student metric actually, last time I looked, the rank ordering is Princeton, then Yale, Harvard, Stanford in that order. Probably not coincidentally, if I recall correctly, it was Princeton that started the move to more generous aid, followed by the other three. The other five Ivies don't have the money to do that and I believe the same is true for Chicago, Duke etc.

178.<<<CU123>>>
Actually all the Ivies, Stanford, UChicago and probably a few others all meet 100% of demonstrated financial need. They all are a little different on how they figure it with Princeton being the most generous, then Harvard, with Yale, and UChicago and the rest of the Ivies about the same. If admitted to more than one they will usually match the best offer.

179.<<<bluewater2015>>>
The definition of demonstrated need varies from school to school though, in some cases substantially.

180.<<<reuynshard>>>
Perhaps we can all agree to disagree.

For every point in favor of Stanford - yield rates, admit rates, strengths in engineering, sports and entrepreneurship, more Turing award winners, etc. there are other points in favor of H/Y/P - strengths in the arts, higher test scores and graduation rates, larger endowments, financial aid for international students, undergraduate focus, more Nobel Laureates, Fields Medallists or Presidents etc.

People weigh different factors differently. Just because you think it's crystal clear that University A trumps College B doesn't mean that a majority of people necessarily have to agree with you.

181.<<<sbballer>>>
actually Stanford faculty have won more Nobel Prizes since 2000 than any other university in the world.

personally I think it's SMH these days..

182.<<<sbballer>>>
Stanford is an FBS power 5 conference school.. and its athletic dept has been the most dominant athletic dept in the country the last 22 years.

athletics bring down Stanford's grad rates and test scores

Caltech and Chicago both of which place the least emphasis on sports have higher test scores than any ivy

just saying

183.<<<reuynshard>>>
Yes, having a good sports program brings Stanford's test scores and grad rates down, but you've completely missed my point there.

For some people who value being surrounded by high academic achievers and don't want too many jocks, Caltech and Chicago might be indeed be marginally better choices for them. Similarly, those who value having peers who are great at athletics might prefer Stanford. What I'm trying to say is that different people have different ideas about what makes the 'best' college.

Expecting your personal opinion to be the one shared by everyone else is myopic.

184.<<<CU123>>>
Like I have said before, if you were to do a blind test for the entering class of the top 10 schools, I doubt anyone could tell the difference between the classes. IOW you couldn't tell me based on just the scores/grades/essays (without any geographic info because a good chunk of Stanford acceptees are from CA) which class belonged to which school. Maybe even the top 20.

185.<<<bluewater2015>>>
Just as a point of fact sbballer, last time I looked, SAT scores at both Harvard and Yale are marginally higher than at Chicago. That was comparing Common Data Set numbers from H and Y with Big Future numbers from Chicago. Last I looked Chicago does not release CDS data publicly. You may be right about CalTech though.

186.<<<Penn95>>>
@reuynshard But surely you agree that at Stanford you find not only top athletes but also (and actually primarily) super impressive academic achievers and special kids with really unique academic accomplishments.

187.<<<Penn95>>>
@bluewater2015 you are right HYPS have in general the most generous financial aid. Probably MIT comes a bit after. The other ivies, Chicago, Duke do not that kind of endowment to really match HYPS.

188.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
@bluewater2015 you can spend a lot of time correcting the many confidently-stated errors in the posts of a certain fake-until-proven-otherwise Stanford student. I do it for the high school students who don't know better and might actually believe them.

189.<<<CU123>>>
@bluewater2015

Here is a link for you to look at:

Just so you know it shows UChicago as #1, not that it really matters.

190.<<<finolex1>>>
@Penn95 Of course, but if being in a place where virtually everyone is an academic high achiever is important to you, then yes, Caltech might indeed be the best choice.

191.<<<bluewater2015>>>
Thanks CU123, DeepBlue86 and Penn95.

That link is interesting on the SAT scores and maybe it's changed since I last looked. Though the fact that it doesn't show Yale in the top 10 makes me wonder if the data are correct . . .

192.<<<CU123>>>
Who knows.....Cal Tech and Stanford don't either which makes me wonder if they think California is going to fall into the Pacific or they asked each school to provide the numbers and Yale, Stanford and Cal Tech blew them off or they have that east coast bias or UChicago is well represented on the senior staff of USNWR or.....

193.<<<prezbucky>>>
Yeah, that US News list has a bunch of holes...

This is much better:

I think the average football player at Stanford scored approximately 1000 on the SAT. Christian McCaffrey scored a whopping 24 on the ACT. I certainly wouldn't want my kids taking any classes with football players at Stanford. I would hope kids go to college for academic reasons. The Ivy league sets academic standards for athletes which is truly refreshing.

195.<<<sushiritto>>>
Never heard of student-athlete? What's wrong with going to school and playing a major D1 sport? Stanford has won the Directors Cup every year since 1993-94. Stanford competes at the highest level of college sports.

196.<<<sushiritto>>>
Alternative Facts: Christian McCaffrey's ACT score came from a USC forum, unless it's published somewhere where you can point me to it.

"The price of athletics at Stanford | Stanford Daily
Stanford Daily  2015/02/22 Looking at the Stanford recruitment class of 2009 (this year was quite typical in terms of test scores), the median football player who reported scores got an 1800 out of 2400 on the SAT."

7-8 years ago is a long time.

198.<<<prezbucky>>>
Vanderbilt, Stanford, Northwestern, Rice, Notre Dame and Duke are the only schools with a full slate of D1 (top-level D1...) sports programs that made that top 22 list last year. The big-money sports -- football and basketball -- probably pull down the stats the most. They probably try to get as many high-stat jocks as possible, but given their commitment to winning at the D1 level, sometimes they have to take low-stat kids. Stanford hasn't been terribly good in men's basketball recently, but they're pretty good in just about everything else.

Stanford, Duke and other D1 private elites could take only 1400+ SAT football and basketball players if they wanted to, but then they would win very few games, which would mean fewer televised games, no bowl games, no NCAA tourney appearances, lower merch sales, and fewer fannies in seats... which would seriously hurt the bottom line.

They have chosen this path, and I doubt they're sweating the 5-10 points shaved off their SAT averages due to low-stat football and basketball players.

The Ivies and D3 elites have higher standards for their student-athletes, but they can afford to: they stand to lose less $$$ if they don't clobber their competitors. (that doesn't mean their teams don't play hard, of course -- I would like to see a Yale/Harvard football game or maybe Penn/Princeton someday...)

Ultimately, schools choose whether to be D1, 1AA, 2, 3, whatever. You reap what you sow. (pro and con)

199.<<<websensation>>>
@CU123 If you read my post, that IS what I am saying. I specifically state in my post: "It just goes to show you you shouldn't make a decision based one or two people you meet from certain schools." The point I am trying to make is that not all students or professors at great universities are great or vice-versa. So I am in agreement with you. I met many smart people from West Virginia and other state schools. And I met many not so smart people from Cornell and other Ivies.

The fact is there are many super smart kids who go to state schools on full ride scholarships even though they could have attended one of the HYPSM. That alone should indicate that there are many smart students and professors in every college.

As an example, one of the smartest student in my kid's high school has decided to attend a good state university on a full ride scholarship. That student got denied from Stanford, but I am being honest (not humble) when I say that particular student has done better academically (specifically gpa wise) than my own kid in the same high school. The other kid got A+s and As while my kid got As and A-s and one or two Bs. In addition, the other kid is a very nice kid imo. I am pretty certain the other kid will do very, very well at the state school, and that kid is every bit as smart as most HYPSM students imo. Also, the smartest student (arguably) at my kid's HS is going to Johns Hopkins, and didn't even apply to HYPSM.

200.<<<bluewater2015>>>
There was an interesting article in Stanford magazine a few years ago on sports. It's a continuing balancing act.

<url>https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=72888</url>

Obviously, some of the top level public universities also have top level sports programs (UNC, Michigan, UCLA, etc.) but those are much larger schools, so varsity athletes are only ~1-2% of all students.

[quote]I think the average football player at Stanford scored approximately 1000 on the SAT. Christian McCaffrey scored a whopping 24 on the ACT. I certainly wouldn't want my kids taking any classes with football players at Stanford.[/quote]

A kid I know got in this year (and will enroll at) a "better" ivy as an athlete (not a major sport) :

ACT -- 25C, 25R, 23W, 29M, 23S
SAT -- 580R, 560W, 540M

I am using this as a counter-example to say that ivies do similar things, just don't know how high is their academic bar. I don't see the difference between a 24 ACT and a 25 ACT, especially the minor difference for the new SAT. For the math section, the new SAT means (S)tupid (A)lgebra (T)est, to me.

Stanford pays some of the academic students to help those athletes. My son did one semester. I don't see anything wrong with it.

203.<<<sbballer>>>
football players score low at all colleges including ivies (i might add hockey too).

Stanford competes at the highest level of athletic competition in the most competitive conference in the US.

Stanford has won more individual and national championships than any college in the US with a Student body 1/5 the size of its athletic peers USC, UCLA, Berkeley, Texas

Stanford athletes racked up 27 medals 14 gold at the Rio Olympics (it's Gold haul was more than many countries including Australia!)

Whereas sports may be a hook at less competitive athletic colleges... it's actually much harder to get into Stanford as an athlete considering the higher level of athletic achievement necessary as well as the academic hurdles an applicant will have to deal with.

204.<<<websensation>>>
I think we should laud Stanford for maintaining a good balance of academics and athletic accomplishments. If my kid had to participate in a team sport in high school, he would be so tired that he would fall asleep at 9 PM and have no time to do homework properly or lead school clubs. I give big props to athletes who managed to excel in sports while doing decently in academics. My kid participate in team sport for one year where he unexpectedly was very good, and he gained a greater respect for kids who participated in athletics all four years. I played several sports in high school, so I know the energy, time and commitment that even one sport takes. You can't really appreciate what others have to go through unless you are in the same situation. We all need to respect people who try hard and excel in different areas. If that's what Stanford is all about, I am all for it.

205.<<<arbitrary99>>>
@websensation

True.

My son gets home at 6pm from track practice, and every week has a meet either on a Tuesday or Saturday, if not both. My other son practices squash 2 hours a day, and the tournaments are often out of town by plane flight. My nephew at Dartmouth have three a day workouts in XC skiing.

The commitment of these kids is incredible, and they make academics a priority as well.

Wall Street loves athletes because a. they have proven that they can focus and commit; and b. have great team skills.

206.<<<websensation>>>
I tend to think that even though my high school gpa was 3.0, because I played lots of sport, I developed a sense of "never giving up" attitude when the going gets tough and working for your team attitude. I knew I could turn it on in the real world. Man, when my un-athletic kid participated in school sports for one year, he was wiped out and falling asleep at 8 pm. lol It was very tough on him physically because he was unused to it that he gave up after one year. Good thing he did too because freed up time allowed him to pursue many outside school activities and school leadership positions.

Funny thing is he became very good in that sport so that his coach was very disappointed to see him leave, but when I asked him how come he wants to quit when he is good in that sport, he told me "Dad, I am not really good but I tried super hard because I didn't want to let my teammates down." Even though he quit after first year, I am really glad that he gave it a try because it gave him a sense of appreciation for kids who pursue different areas.

Same thing with debate activities. It takes a lot of time and commitment. I am hoping my kid finds a kid who will make him run or jog every day at Stanford. I really believe in the "healthy body, healthy mind" philosophy. All the fame and money in the world matters not when your body is hurting, not healthy or in pain. Add the spiritual/religious health also. I say this even though I am an agnostic.

"Based on university statistics, this puts the football median comfortably in the bottom quartile and likely somewhere in the bottom 10 percent in terms of test scores. Stanford football players are quite smart, but the data suggests they place near the bottom of Stanfords admits. "

The odds of Stanford football players being in a certain major "17 of them are majoring in science, technology, and society, an interdisciplinary major at Stanford.The odds of this happening by chance are about 1 in 600,000,000,000 (six-hundred billion), roughly equivalent to flipping heads 40 times in row, and far less likely than winning the California State Lottery jackpot" <url>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/math-meets-football-one-in-600-billion/</url>

I put my 2 cents in here, my middle daughter was a recruited athlete and when I asked her if she really wanted to play her sport in college she told me that "she wasn't really sure". My response, good, no need to play then, that isn't what you're there for.

Caveat: I understand that this is the only way some will get admitted or afford college. I actually feel sorry for those athletes that don't have a real choice.

220.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@DeepBlue86 - I disagree with you on one thing. I don't think sbballer is a "fake." I think sbballer is most likely either a current or former S(tanford) B(asket) Baller who is responsible for having steeply brought down the average Stanford SAT score. Feeling extremely inadequate and with low self-esteem, ALL he or she does on this forum is one thing and the only thing: glorification of Stanford. It doesn't matter whether, by continuing to behave in that manner, he/she's ultimately doing disservice to the great institution that is Stanford, as any intelligent person can clearly see. The reason why he/she can't stop is all psychological. A typical profile of someone like this is that he/she's been rejected by the Ivy schools because, in spite of being an outstanding athlete, no Ivy schools would accept someone with very low academic records. Most likely the greatest thing and the only greatest thing that has ever happen in that person's life was being accepted by Stanford. IMO, this explains the person's behavior and likewise, with all others who exhibit the psychological phenomenon that's within the similar profile as sbballer. If you go to HYP forums, you don't find this embarrassing phenomenon. Only in this forum you'd find this massive obsession with Stanford #1, with PRESTIGE #1. If you know you're that great, then you don't need to try to prove the point in such obsessive and religious manner. I don't get that sense when I visit the HYP forums. You don't find someone acting in such manner to reveal a profound lack of self-esteem and inadequacy. I cringe whenever I see such posts.

222.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I believe he/she wishes they were a Stanford basketball player, but I think actually they're a high school fanboy/girl or some sort of adult obsessive. I've repeatedly invited them to prove me wrong - so far, crickets.

A real Stanford basketball player wouldn't have the time to post the quantity of nonsense this person pumps out; more importantly, they wouldn't feel the need to. It's a huge achievement to go to Stanford and play on the Stanford basketball team, and I doubt any of its members has the kind of corrosive insecurity we see here.

And I agree - you generally don't see this kind of combative rudeness and one-upmanship on the HYP forums. The vast majority comes from a small number of bad apples, and this person is the poster child for it (emphasis on "child").

If someone who works in the Stanford administration or admissions office is reading this, I suggest you check out some of @sbballer's posts and intervene. PM them, ask them to prove who they say they are (and they have claimed to be a student on at least one other thread). If they won't do it, report them and get them banned; they're bringing the school into disrepute.

@sbballer If you are a Stanford student or alum, you certainly aren't representing the school very well. I find your comments awfully immature.

All this trying to prove that Stanford is #1. What difference does it make? Harvard will probably always have a global reputation as being the best. It's ingrained into our and other cultures, just like Einstein is equated with the word genius.

Nevertheless, I turned down schools like Harvard, Yale and others because I felt I would be most happiest at Stanford. I would make this same choice 100 times out of 100 knowing what I now know and what I have experienced. What the world thinks about Stanford or the other schools should have no impact on what school someone chooses. Spending four years being miserable at a school just because it's perceived reputation is better than your other choices is no way to spend your college years. Go to where you think and feel you will thrive and be happy.

Personally, I think that schools like Williams can offer things that a HYPSM cannot (unfortunately, in my field not) and I applaud those kids who have the self-confidence and self-awareness to turn down the big name schools if they believe an LAC like Williams is a better fit. Not many do though.

230.<<<sushiritto>>>

@TiggerDad

"The reason why he/she can't stop is all psychological. A typical profile of someone like this is that he/she's been rejected by the Ivy schools because, in spite of being an outstanding athlete, no Ivy schools would accept someone with very low academic records."

Why do you comment on things you really don't know anything about? Were you a recruited athlete? Did you go to Stanford or an Ivy as an undergrad? From your comments, I would conclude no to the above questions.

I happen to know about these things and your perspective is so far off base.

232.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Multiverse7 - Well put, couldn't have said it better myself. I also personally think Williams offers things that HYPSM can't. There are things that Stanford offers that are different from Harvard or anywhere else and vice versa. It's all about fit for each particular individual that matters. Good for you in choosing what you want instead of extraneous factors. To me as a parent, Williams would have been a better fit than any other colleges that my son was admitted to. As a parent, I'd have felt a sense of greater assurance. My son chose Princeton, instead, and after we came back from its Preview events a few days ago, I couldn't have been happier for him. Like you, he wouldn't have chosen any other college. Regardless of where everyone goes in terms of college, my deepest wish is that everyone turns out to be productive citizens who contribute to the betterment of our nation and the world.

233.<<<Multiverse7>>>
Thanks @TiggerDad. Good luck to your son! I'm sure he'll be one of the many, many happy alums someday.

I know the school pretty well having done a lot of research there. It's a terrific school and he will enjoy his time there.

234.<<<arbitrary99>>>
I would say the satisfaction among all the grads I know between Stanford, Yale and Princeton is quite similar; Harvard tends to have more people that are less happy with it. Dartmouth more fanatical alums. Between those schools and others like Amherst, Williams and U of Chicago, it's more of which flavor of ice cream do you prefer, at the undergrad level. The schools are more of what you make of them.

One of the schools though will really connect with you and that's the one you should attend. Once there, you will love it.

I have been to Stanford games like that too. When Harbaugh first got hired, they were emailing me asking me if I wanted FREE tickets.

The full stadiums except for the big game is a fairly recent phenomenon.

Besides, the fun for me isn't the national ranking but being outside with friends, watching student/athletes performing.

Here's some real cross-admit data from Stanford: <url>https://stanford.app.box.com/s/y4abufqg66nte7uax6eq</url>

To summarize, for the class of 2018 the percentage of cross admits to the following schools who chose Stanford were: Harvard - 42%, Princeton - 75%, Yale - 58%, MIT - 61%.

Overall yield rates haven't changed by much since then, possibly by a couple of % points at most. It's worth noting that less than 10% (!) of admits to Stanford were admitted to the rest of its 'peer' schools, so the applicant pools are a lot more separate than you think.

246.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I continue to wonder where Stanford gets the above information (I don't know what the abbreviations for the sources at the bottom of the slide mean). I'm not an expert, but it seems to me it might not be legal for universities to share with each other who got in and went where. If they can't do that, the data must be self-reported by the students, in which case how can it be reliable or complete?

Also, I wonder how Stanford characterizes a student who gets into, say, Harvard, Yale and Stanford, and enrolls at Harvard. It's a win for Harvard in cross-admits with Stanford, but how does Stanford reflect that the student was a Yale-Stanford cross-admit and chose to attend neither school? Also, is there double-counting in the total numbers of cross-admits (i.e., does that kid show up as a Stanford cross-admit with both Harvard and Yale)?

In this regard, the Today Show reported this morning that the set of quadruplets who all were admitted to Harvard and Yale (and at least one of which was also admitted to Stanford) have all chosen Yale (see the thread on this subject, also here: @finolex1 notes, given that HYPS all have 70-80% yields, the overlap in the admitted students must be small. Also, I would guess, many students give a lot of weight to geography in making their decision. I would be very interested to know the choices of Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and West Coast students cross-admitted with Stanford and any of HYP.

247.<<<hebegebe>>>
[quote]I would be very interested to know the choices of Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and West Coast students cross-admitted with Stanford and any of HYP.[/quote]
Tiny sample set and not strictly cross-admits, but the last time I looked, Harvard had a yield rate of 80%+ from our local high school (in Massachusetts).

In stark contrast, Stanford's yield was about 20%! Few students were willing to go cross country given the local Harvard and MIT alternatives.

248.<<<ewho>>>
[quote]In this regard, the Today Show reported this morning that the set of quadruplets who all were admitted to Harvard and Yale (and at least one of which was also admitted to Stanford) have all chosen Yale[/quote]
Congrats to Yale! Yale did this a few years back too. It is probably a good news for the Stanford waitlist people. Last year, Stanford accepted 50 from the waitlist.

249.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
It's what you'd expect, @hebegebe, no? As I said a few pages ago, there's clear geographic skew visible in the enrolled student numbers:
[quote]What we know is that 36% of Stanford students are from California and I would guess close to 50% are from the West Coast overall (<url>http://facts.stanford.edu/academics/undergraduate-profile</url>), while 39% of current Harvard freshmen are from New England or the Mid-Atlantic states and only 17% are from the "Pacific" region (<url>https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/admissions-statistics</url>). Each of Stanford and Harvard is getting top students, but each gets a subset skewed toward its home region.[/quote]

I think that's a major factor in cross-admit choices, which is why I'd love to see that Stanford cross-admit data (assuming it's accurate) segmented geographically.

261.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
I think the flaw in your argument, @stanfordfoodie, is that you believe the cross-admit population, and the Manging of victory, is large enough to be relevant. As the Stanford faculty senate proceedings note, the overlap is 200'students or fewer per school. Harvard and Stanford both have 80% yields, so both pretty much get who they want, and there can't be much of an overlap. A 10% swing in winning of cross admits is a shift of 20 kids. I really don't think that makes a noticeable difference in a class of well over 1,600. If there were a 200-student overlap and Stanford were winning every one, you might begin to have a case, but we're not nearly there. Furthermore, some of those cross-admits, no doubt, are choosing to enroll at Yale, Princeton, MIT and other places.

Finally, as I've shown elsewhere, the major determinant of cross-admit decisions is likely to be geography. If a few more kids from New England are choosing to go to Stanford these days, and the number of Californians choosing to cross the country to go to Harvard is modestly decreasing, I don't believe it's altering the talent mix in any significant way.

262.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
^^^"margin", not "Manging"...

Thinking about this further, I go back to how these schools choose those they admit. I wrote a pretty extensive post the other day reasoning back from the disclosed numbers of students in the various subgroups actually enrolled at HYPSM, and taking account of the Stanford faculty senate numbers on cross-admits (which I have some questions about, but whatever), to try to understand how these schools could have similar admissions processes but also high yields and relatively small numbers of cross-admits; you can find it here (see also my follow-up post below it): <url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/discussion/comment/20623381/#Comment_20623381</url>

S and H each year admit about 2,000 applicants and expect to lose 20% of them, principally to YPM but also to a wide variety of LACs, state schools, specialized programs at other top-twenty unis, etc. I believe only a small minority of students are admitted for sheer brilliance, and therefore that those most likely to be cross-admitted are a mix of high-performing URMs, athletes and other kids with particular attributes that make them institutional priorities (which might be anything from being the President's daughter to being a published author to being the star student in an underrepresented state to being the child of a fabulously wealthy oligarch, and any number of other things), plus some number of kids with interesting personal stories (e.g., the quadruplets who were on the Today Show the other day, all of whom were cross-admitted to H and Y and at least one of whom was also cross-admitted to S). And then, of course, there are some who are great students and leaders, who wrote essays and got recommendations that impressed more than one of HYPSM.

Also, bear in mind that each school admits many kids who fail to get into any of the other schools, either because they don't apply there or they're denied. Maybe one year only one school needs a tympanist (who is therefore denied at the other schools), or maybe that S legacy didn't make the cut at HYPM. Or maybe that kid who got in early to H called it a day and didn't submit any other applications.

So let's say 200 kids are cross-admitted to H and S, and many or most of them come from the groups I cited above. If 120 of them go to S and 80 of them go to H, as opposed to 110 and 90, or 100 each, does anyone really believe that it affects either school to a significant degree? Particularly when a lot of them are choosing on the basis of geography? And, big-picture, when each of these schools is admitting 2,000 kids per year, 80% of whom are going to accept their offers and only 10% of whom are cross-admits with the other school in the first place? I don't.

So, to return to my restaurant analogy, the largest group of Stan's customers come from the western part of the city, while most of the customers of Harry's, Yvonne's and Peter's come from the eastern part. All the customers of all the restaurants are either very diligent in speed-dialing to get their reservations, or they're preferred customers known to the maitre d'. As groups, everyone in any one of the restaurants is very similar to everyone in any one of the others. They're all very much the same kind of people, in other words, but a lot of them greatly prefer to eat in their local restaurant, or are partial to some dish that they believe is prepared best in one of the restaurants. Some of them are willing to drive across town to go to their preferred place.

A small number of them get reservations at multiple places and choose among them. If many people were getting multiple reservations, and everyone were choosing Stan's, then Harry's, Yvonne's and Peter's would have a problem that could affect their business. People would say that the crowd was much better at Stan's, and there could be a cascade effect wherein all the devotees of the restaurants in the eastern part of town would try to defect to Stan's. Nothing like that is happening, though - there are lines out the door, the food's great and the conversation is sparkling everywhere.

In conclusion, I hope the management of Stan's, cheered by the number of reservation requests, doesn't get complacent and start under-investing in food, decor and chefs. They may not fully realize how fortunate they are to be the only great restaurant in their neighborhood. Also, the other restaurants prepare many kinds of excellent food, and are working hard to raise their seafood game...

"If 120 of them go to S and 80 of them go to H, as opposed to 110 and 90, or 100 each, does anyone really believe that it affects either school to a significant degree?"

The answer is, of course, no. But I'd even go further by asking the question: if any of HYPSM suddenly lost the entire class of 2021 just admitted due to an alien kidnapping or whatever, would it have truly lost something by replacing the original class with the next batch of student body given today's depth of outstanding applicants knocking on its gates of entrance?

@DeepBlue86 I am a badger with previous life in the mountains in China.

One day on a mountain, there were two monks trying to cross a river. One big fat guy and one skinny guy. For them the rule was that they were not allowed to think about girls.

Right about they were trying to cross the river, there was a girl trying to cross the river too. So, the big fat monk volunteered to carry the girl to cross the river. So he did. Then, the two monks and the girl went on to different roads afterwards.

After a while, the skinny monk said to the big fat monk: "hey, we are not supposed to think/carry girls."

The big fat monk said: " No, we are not. I did not carry her , but you have been carrying her, mentally."

P.S., BTW, sometimes things are becoming extinct not due to competition but due to the change of time, like the typewriter, for example.

265.<<<websensation>>>
@TiggerDad IMO the answer to your question is aside from around 5% ~ 10% of the original class who are exceptional even among top students, probably no difference. My kid probably is not in that top 10%. Lol

266.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@websensation - I even question the top 5% - 10%. I'm pretty sure, by any standard, Ted Kaczynski belonged in the top 5-10% when he was accepted to Harvard at the age of 16. Who would have predicted that once a child prodigy would have grown up to be educated at Harvard only to be the Unabomber. How many kids belonging outside of the top 5-10% like yours and mine, on the other hand, have gone on to fill the Congress seats, business board rooms, etc. There's no way you can predict with any degree of surety that a particular top college IS getting the best of the best just as surely you can't predict what life has in store for all of us. In fact, I can tell you with absolute surety that I don't know what "best" is. I'll leave that up to all the regular Stanford zealots here to tell us. ^:)^

If by "going into lengths" you mean making a case with facts as opposed to confident but fact-light assertions about relative prestige, I think we can use more of that on all the forums.

@Penn95 - Actually, the only reason why I came on this Stanford forum was because of YOU and one sbballer's posts on the Princeton forum making all kinds of claims about Stanford uber alles. Again, fact check, please. Here's JUST ONE of your posts on the Princeton forum:

"Yes I think Stanford is more prestigious than Princeton (and Yale). Some of the reasons why I think that: Stanford is ranked top/near the top in pretty much all fields, it is in the top 3-4 in almost every international ranking, is extremely desirable by college applicants (huge number of applications) and also its yield rate (admits who choose to enroll) is quite higher than Princeton or Yale's (82% vs 69%- 70%). Along with Harvard it also comes on top in terms of fundraising every year. It has the biggest number of nobel laureate for this century as well as the biggest number of successful entrepreneurs. Stanford is in the heart of Silicon Valley, which is the future.
I would put Stanford neck and neck with Harvard for the top spot, ahead of Princeton and Yale. But I will not be surprised if in the next few decades Stanford even surpasses Harvard in terms of prestige.
Also just an interesting trend I have noticed, in the past when there would be articles about elite schools they two prime examples that would be almost always mentioned were Harvard, Yale. Nowadays Harvard, Stanford are more often mentioned in that context."

AND you make the following statement?!?!?!? "another thing I don't see on he HYP forums is Stanford people trying to assert Stanford's dominance over HYP and going into lengths to insist hat Stanford is just as good/prestigious as HYP."

That's funny and embarrassing at the same time, wouldn't you think?

275.<<<Multiverse7>>>
Is @Penn95 a Stanford person? I thought they went to Penn in which case making a case for Stanford in the Princeton's forum wouldn't be a violation of what they said. Anyway, this is all more than a bit silly. It feels like we're trying to determine whose father can beat up whose.

276.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Multiverse7 - Does it matter whether Penn95 went to Penn or Stanford or whatever? Making unfounded statements regarding whatever the college needs to be questioned, don't you think? When questioned, Penn95 made a contradictory statement, and he got called on it. Stanford, or any college for that matter, doesn't need these myth makers.

@TiggerDad I was merely referring to the post above mine in which you chastise @Penn95 for making that statement. I was pointing out that if they didn't attend Stanford they are technically not violating what they said as you seemed to indicate.

Yes, people make all sorts of unsubstantiated claims on CC on just about anything and everything. I think you are getting all worked up about this for nothing. As many, many posters have said, all these elite schools are on par with each other and people can jump up and down about the school they attend(ed) (or admire) but it doesn't change that fact. It's all a matter of personal fit when it comes down to choosing between them.

278.<<<websensation>>>
@TiggerDad, Agree with your point. When I was saying top 5% -10%, I was talking about academic ability, not their character or other factors. Unabomber was a whacko but he was probably a smart guy academically. I don't think colleges do all that good job of picking kids with good characters. Read that Ted Bundy was a good student in psychology and even attended Stanford course during summer on some scholarship. If you throw out the admitted batch of kids with an entirely new set of kids, imo only 5% to 10% of kids will be very hard to replace, maybe even lower like 2%. That's my main point. It would be an interesting social experiment. But I agree that it's not easy to determine kids' abilities in the long run based on what they did in two or three years.

279.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Multiverse7 - You're losing your credibility by defending the indefensible in a most laughable manner. Penn95 has not only made a bunch of unsubstantiated claims in his zealous attempt at systematic Stanford myth building but either lied or at least contradicted himself with the statement that you yourself quoted, and the only argument that you can come up is that "maybe" Penn95 is not Stanford affiliated and therefore not in "violation"!!!? I had some hope in you, namely, finding an honest and intelligent Stanford person with some regard to facts and truth, someone who considers these to be more important than defending falsehoods simply because Stanford needs to be defended at all cost, moral, intellectual and personal integrity.

280.<<<DeepBlue86>>>
Easy, Tigger =;

I generally agree with @Multiverse7, tbh. Sometimes people get overexcited in pressing their point of view, on here, at cocktail parties and anywhere else. We generally listen patiently and occasionally say something when it gets to be too much. They're very different from the few people who are gratuitously offensive (e.g., the Special So-Fake Stanford student, who is in his/her own category).

281.<<<Multiverse7>>>
I wasn't defending @Penn95 and I never said I agreed with anything they've written. I just said that @penn95 said that you don't see Stanford people posting braggadocio or whatever on HYP fora and you jumped all over him for doing just that - I merely questioned if he was actually a Stanford alum or not so possibly not in violation of his statement. But nevermind, you seem way more invested in this than I am.

You don't need to start personal attacks on me as well. I haven't been waiving a Stanford banner above all else in any of my posts. In fact, it's been the opposite. I've said all along these are all amazing schools that have offer slightly different things so it boils down to personal preference.

I think you should probably wage your war with the posters that bother you so much offline. I don't see how any of this is productive. They obviously feel strongly about their beliefs and so do you about yours. Nobody appears willing to budge. I prefer not to get dragged into this because there is a certain vitriol in your comments that is unsettling.

282.<<<2018dad>>>
LOL on these uber-exited parents having kids attending the super elite schools (HYPMS). Good thing that my daughter was rejected by Princeton and waitlisted by Stanford and attending a second-tier Ivy. Otherwise I'll be like @TiggerDad or his Stanford counterpart. j/k

283.<<<Multiverse7>>>
I predict that this thread will be shut down soon anyway. CC is not supposed to be an argumentative community which is what this has devolved into.

I wonder what my nice picture of the multiverse will look like with jails bars on it :)

284.<<<Multiverse7>>>
@TiggerDad

Here is in fact my previous comment to the other person on your hit list.
[quote]@sbballer If you are a Stanford student or alum, you certainly aren't representing the school very well. I find your comments awfully immature[/quote]

If they and @penn95 are, in fact, not Stanford students or alumni, then your assertion about the need for STANFORD people to spread falsehoods about Stanford or other schools is in itself false. AND @upenn95's comment that you don't see Stanford people posting hype on HYP fora IS true. I point this out at the risk of once again inciting your ire but it couldn't be helped.

You have two independent posters making whatever claims about Stanford on various fora. Don't blame Stanford people including myself. I will exit this discussion now.

285.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@2018dad - I have a strong aversion to ANY of HYPSM's attempt at what I'd call a "systematic myth building." It so happens that Stanford -- the institution that I have a healthy dosage of admiration and respect for -- zealotry in this regard is most evident and not in others. Replace "Stanford" with any of the HYPM, and I'd enjoy the same level of deconstruction of the myth building.

@Multiverse7 - Enjoy the rest of your time at Stanford, but I'd advise that you don't become a lawyer. ;)

286.<<<Multiverse7>>>
^^ Thanks for well wishes and the jab. I'm sure it felt good to write that. I'm 18, I still have plenty of time to hopefully mature in both thinking and actions (but law is not in my future, so don't worry).

Plus, you are using of N of 2 to make a blanket statement about pervasive Stanford "zealortry". One of the posters, you keep baiting into admitting they are a HS student and the other poster likely never even attended Stanford. And you can't seem to let this go. So I wish you luck in this war to fight the injustice of systematic myth building.

287.<<<ewho>>>
Let's end

Stanford vs HYP

in any sense.

If we don't, the nature/time will do it, soon.

288.<<<Multiverse7>>>
I'm with you @ewho!

289.<<<nevrgiveup>>>
Lol. I had to go back and read the first post to recollect how this entire thread got started.

OP: Stanford's the best!!!
Somebody: Oh no its not!
Somebody else: Of course it is!!
Yet somebody else: Totally not true!!
blah. blah
blah. blah
blah. blah

At the end of it all, I wonder how many changed their minds. What a total waste of 20 pages!!

290.<<<ewho>>>
^ sorry to waste your precious 10 min. I thought you knew the answer.

291.<<<WelcomeWeek>>>
One of the reasons Stanford has gotten better over the years is because of better geographical diversity. If you go back 25 years, there were probably many kids from California at Ivy League schools like Princeton, but relatively few kids at Stanford from New Jersey or New York. I know many kids from the East Coast who had an interest in attending Stanford, but their parents did not want them going to school that far away. Nowadays, it's no big deal for kids to go to college on the opposite coast, or in another country.

292.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@nevrgiveup - "At the end of it all, I wonder how many changed their minds. What a total waste of 20 pages!!"

Yes, but the systematic attempt at myth building (Stanford best!) has come to a halt. &lt;:-P

293.<<<ewho>>>
^ No worries. When the intrinsic values of two things are different, they will be priced accordingly. It is not up to what we think.

294.<<<Multiverse7>>>
@TiggerDad So when anyone says anything positive about Stanford in a Stanford thread in a Stanford forum it is "myth building" but when you start a thread trying to get people to extoll upon the virtues of Princeton and why they chose it in the Princeton forum, that's okay? Hmmm. Seems hypocritical to me.

295.<<<TiggerDad>>>
@Multiverse7 - In your earlier defense, you said you're 18. Well, I've seen kids at age 13 who know how to discern what is right from wrong. Being 18 doesn't exempt you from the freedom of knowing such a difference. I have no idea how you got yourself into Stanford with your lack of rudimentary comprehension between myth making (Stanford is best!) and factual statements about Stanford. Apparently, you can't tell either from my post in Princeton forum the difference between myth making and factual statements about Princeton.

Each year, there are many high school seniors trying their best to make a decision as to which school would be the best fit for them. Throwing a bunch of myths about Stanford (and I know you're not one of those who've been contributing to this; I'm taking about certain others), as opposed to fact based inputs, does them more harm than good. I just read somewhere here on CC that a large percentage of students majoring in humanities, as well as social sciences, at Stanford, felt out of place in an environment that is more STEM and CS strong. I wonder how many of them chose Stanford because of "Stanford's best!" myth that they've been fed on.

296.<<<Multiverse7>>>
Here you go with your ad hominem attacks again. Yes, I'm 18. Probably the same age as your son. I hope after he enters Princeton he doesn't ever face an adult who mischaracterizes what they say (reread your first attack on me) and then goes on personal attacks instead of sticking to the issues.

You haven't succeeded in stopping the "myth building" on this thread, you've succeeded in shutting down completely anyone wanting to say anything positive about Stanford that might actually be useful to "high school seniors" because they're afraid you will go all psycho on them like you are on me with rude personal attacks and jabs. Well, I'm fighting back as I hope your son would also do.

Because you perceive that I do not understand the difference between Stanford puffery and honest opinions about Stanford you say that you don't know how I "got myself into Stanford". Nice, very mature and certainly germaine to this discussion. It's more like if I don't side with your railroading of everyone that doesn't agree with your methods I'm an idiot.

Yes, I somehow fooled Stanford (and Harvard and Yale for that matter to accept me) despite being a complete ignoramus. I also started working in a highly theoretical field at your vaunted Princeton while in middle school so they were the first to be fooled. I know the school much better than you or your son. Period. I did not even apply to Princeton because although it's a fine school (as I said to you earlier) the truth is I like many, many things about Stanford better (gasp!). I am allowed to have my own opinions that places Stanford over Princeton - or is that just another example of my rudimentary comprehension for that too?

Anyway, I was going to go on writing a rebuttal but now I've just decided to quit while I'm behind (letting you win, okay?). I'm already very upset myself for getting into it this far with you. You can find someone else to beat up.

I'm retiring from posting for a while because this has left such a bad taste in my mouth.

297.<<<sushiritto>>>
@Multiverse7 Stanford IS best. And you may ask why? Well, because they've won the Director's Cup every friggin' year since 1993-1994. Seriously, I've read most of the thread and you're doing fantastic. Bunch of old people arguing about absolutely nothing. The Internet. We can't live with it and we can't live without it.

I have a D18 and I can only hope she can accepted to any of these schools that us old people argue about all the time. ^:)^

No quitting allowed.

298.<<<prezbucky>>>
What about their colors? Which school has the best color(s)? Worst?

Harvard Crimson: Crimson
MIT Engineers: Cardinal Red &amp; Steel Gray
Princeton Tigers: Orange &amp; Black
Stanford Cardinal: Cardinal &amp; White
Yale Bulldogs -- or Elis?: Yale Blue

MIT's mascot is a beaver... river engineers. Pretty funny.

Stanford used to be the Indians. They stopped using that name in the '70s and went the Harvard way, simply calling themselves by their main color.

Yale -- Can someone explain the Eli/Bulldog thing? What do the students think?

Princeton -- Not the greatest colors according to my tastes, but using the biggest of all cats and probably the most talented mammalian land predator as your mascot is cool. When in doubt, show 'em your teeth!

Harvard: I think they ought to change their mascot to a big piece of mud... maybe call them the Mudders... that would impress the gentry. haha
