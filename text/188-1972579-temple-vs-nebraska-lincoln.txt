I got into both schools and I want to know which one is a better overall school, and which one has a better undergrad business school?

2.<<<mamag2855>>>
I do not know anything about Nebraska Lincoln,  but my sophomore  D attends Temple U as a marketing major in the Fox School of  Business. She has had a great experience so far, with excellent, engaging professors, and most class sizes have been small with good opportunities for discussion. She is in the regular Honors and also Fox Honors programs, which regularly host seminars and networking activities, as well as service opportunities. She also loves being in Philly with great access to museums,  restaurants, etc.

What are your net costs at each school and how much would you and/or your parents have to borrow to send you to either school?

4.<<<moooop>>>
I have a kid studying business at Nebraska. It’s a solid school, and has a good reputation in the region…it gets a lot of students from Chicago & Minneapolis who want a good education in a fun  place at a reasonable cost.
Lincoln has a population of several hundred thousand, & it’s the state capital, so there are lots of internships, restauraunts, etc. Omaha is even bigger, & is 50 minutes away.
Nebraska offers the classic college experience…safe campus & town, friendly people, big-time sports, lots of frats if you want them.
Be aware that in the Northeast a lot of people are dismissive of the Midwest and its colleges. If you go to Nebraska, half the people you know won’t be able to locate it on a map, & the other half will say, “NEBRASKA? Why NEBRASKA? There’s nothing but corn out there!” (Of course they will say this without ever having BEEN  to Nebraska.) Bottom line is my kid likes it a lot & plans to stay there after graduating.

5.<<<happy1>>>
A few things to consider:
–I think the schools will offer two very different experiences so consider what you want for the next 4 years.  Temple has a very urban campus in Phila. and Nebraska has more of a typical college campus with Big Ten football in Lincoln, NE.
–Think about where you want to end up after college.  Temple would have a bigger/stronger alumni base and will be more well-known in the Northeast and Nebraska would have a greater alumni base etc. in that state.  You might also want to contact career placement to get an idea of what firms recruit at each school.
–Look at the costs and determine if both options are affordable without a ton of loans or hardship to your family.

6.<<<barrons>>>
Temple is in a bad area. UNL is not.   All things considered if it is affordable UNL better all around experience.

7.<<<austinmshauri>>>
Your other posts say you’re from CA and have a 3.3 GPA and 1260 SAT. I don’t know if those stats will qualify for much merit aid. You seem to have a lot of OOS schools on your list. The first cut you may want to make is financial. Are all these schools affordable for your family? You have multiple threads asking people to compare various schools, but when finances come up you seem to brush it off. If your parents can pay, it doesn’t matter. But if finances are a consideration don’t waste time contemplating the value of schools that won’t be on the table at decision time in April.

8.<<<happy1>>>
Also, maybe wait until you have all your options and then ask about your top few choices.

9.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri @mom2collegekids
I’m OOS for both schools
Net cost for Nebraska Lincoln for me is about $18-20k. I haven’t received my award letter yet from Temple yet.

10.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@mamag2855 Did you receive much aid if you’re OOS, and if you’re not OOS do you know if they are kind with aid when it comes to OOS students.

11.<<<Publisher>>>
When I was young I used to participate in wrestling & boxing tournaments in North Philly (area where Temple is located). Please, go to Nebraska.
Lincoln is one of the best places in the US in which to live. Lots of techie refugees from Silicon Valley are setting up shop there.
Invest in some land or other real estate if the numbers work for you (rather than renting),

12.<<<Publisher>>>
Also, Lincoln is a beautiful city with Big 10 benefits.

13.<<<newjerseygirl98>>>
I don’t think Temple’s area is so bad.
I went to La Salle, in the middle of a bad neighborhood. My boyfriend in college lived in North Philly, which is terrible. But Temple is separate from the bad areas. Basically, just don’t go north or east of the school.

14.<<<mamag2855>>>
@Lehigh2022 My D was fortunate enough to receive the full tuition presidential merit award during the last year it was still a guaranteed award for certain test scores/gpa. Her merit award exceeds our efc, so she does not receive need based aid. Temple does not meet 100% of demonstrated need, and their merit aid is competetive now. Temple’s Fox school of business tuition is also a lot higher than most other majors, just shy of $36k per year.
If Temple values geographic diversity, or if you have any hooks, you might get some merit, but your scores/gpa alone are likely not high enough for a significant merit award at Temple. If Temple does not come through with a good financial aid package, it certainly seems as though  Nebraska/Lincoln, both the university and the city, have a lot to offer.
Is the package Nebraska has awarded you affordable for your family, or do you have other affordable options?

15.<<<mamag2855>>>
The area surrounding Temple U has been steadily improving over the last few years, although there are still challenges. The university has worked hard to improve and maintain a safe campus for its students. My D and her friends have had no issues.

16.<<<prezbucky>>>
Nebraska advantages:

Probably slightly stronger overall academically (former AAU member).
More of a traditional campus feel and experience
Safer
Much bigger sports scene
State gov’t is there

Temple advantages:

Philadelphia – big city opportunities
The ocean is closer

If it were my decision, I’d pick Nebraska in a heartbeat. But if you want to go to school in a large city, and if you love cheese steaks, Temple is the choice.

17.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Is 18-20k affordable without loans for your family?

18.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@MYOS1634 No but it is better than the other ones. most of the other ones are about 30-35k

19.<<<MYOS1634>>>
That’s a problem. How much CAN your family pay? (If parental loans didn’t exist - I’m assuming you’re taking the 5.5K student loan either way).

20.<<<austinmshauri>>>
@Lehigh2022, If your parents can’t afford $18k/year, it doesn’t matter if the school is less expensive than a $30k/year college. How much can your parents pay? Have you been accepted to any affordable schools?

21.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri , I meant that it is affordable with loans. my parents don’t really want to go over 25-30k a year. They are fine with 18k a year though.
These are my net costs so far:
Nevada-Reno: 12k
San Jose State: 13k
San Diego St: 14k
Nebraska-Lincoln: 18k
Arizona St: 27k
U Iowa: 36k
Michigan St: 46k
Still waiting for: U Washington, U Oregon, Temple, U Delaware, CU Boulder

22.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Can you parents pay 25K WITHOUT LOANS ON THEIR PART or would YOU take the 5.5K loans and your parents would contribute 20K out of pocket, from income and savings?
“affordable with loans” means “unaffordable”.
Affordable means “I take the 5.5K federal loans and my parents, thanks to their income and savings, can pay the rest without loans through the college installment plan”.
Taking 254 or 30K4 in Parent PLUS loans for undergrad is unfair to your parents.
Right now, your best value is SDSU at 14K. Nebraska Lincoln would take you to another State and region in the US and if your parents HAVE 20K then it’s within budget – although I’d be willing to bet good money most kids in Nebraska would give anything for SDSU at 14K! - but it is NOT worth debt when you have SDSU for 14K.

23.<<<twoinanddone>>>
I don’t think any of those you are waiting for are going to come in under $30k.  Pick from those under $20k.  All are good, all will be fun.

24.<<<austinmshauri>>>
Net costs after what! Grants? Student loans and grants? Plus loans? How much can your parents pay without borrowing? Anything over that is unaffordable. You don’t want to have them borrow $20k for your first year then get denied. You’d have debt but no degree.
Start with what they can pay out-of-pocket, add the $5500/year federal student loan and the $3k you can earn from working summers. That’s your budget. Can they pay for any of those schools without having to take a loan to pay for it?

25.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@MYOS1634 But don’t most people get loans that are in the 25-30k range? If that’s not the case than how do people pay for a private like Boston U where costs are around 65-70k a year?

26.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri net costs after grants, no counting loans is 18k a year at Nebraska.

27.<<<austinmshauri>>>
Most people don’t attend private colleges. Most don’t attend residential colleges at all. Can your parents pay $18k/year without borrowing? Post 17 seems to say no. How much can they pay?

28.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri What is the average amount a student takes out each year in loans, isn’t it around 20-25k a year, since you have to take in account the people who end up at privates or expensive out of states?

29.<<<austinmshauri>>>
No. Students can only borrow $5500 as freshman, $6500 as sophs, and $7500/year as Junior’s and seniors.

30.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri Then how to people pay for Boston U, 65k a year. I’m pretty sure not everyone that goes there is paying the full price. or even 40-50k for that matter?

31.<<<happymomof1>>>
@Lehigh2022 - Most students don’t borrow that kind of money.  Most students only borrow the student loans, and go to places that they can afford without loans bigger than that.  That is why nationwide most students go to community colleges or commuting distance 4-years.
The students who attend the expensive places have:

parents who have saved a lot of money to pay for college, or
parents who make a lot of money, or
parents who are willing to live on one parent’s income for four years and spend all of the other parent’s income on college costs, or
grades/test scores/other talents that will get them significant merit-based aid, or
family income that qualifies them for significant need-based aid, or
parents/grandparents/siblings/other relatives who are crazy enough to borrow and/or cosign big loans.

My kid went to community college for two years, and then to an in-state U, because that was what fit our budget.  She graduated with only the junior and senior year student loans.  We didn’t take on any debt.  This has not kept her from being successful in her career.
Run all the numbers that you have so far here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/awardletter.phtml
Look at what the loan amounts mean here: http://www.finaid.org/calculators/loanpayments.phtml
Then run the numbers again assuming you do your first two years at a CA CC, and finish up at a UC or CSU.  That may be your best option overall.

32.<<<austinmshauri>>>
@Lehigh2022, happymomof1 describes the options pretty clearly. Students can’t borrow that kind of money and most parents shouldn’t. Most students commute to a local school.
Are there any colleges within commuting distance of your home? Did you apply to any financial safeties (schools you’re sure you can get in, can afford without loans, and would be happy to attend)?

33.<<<MYOS1634>>>
The average is around 29k for FOUR YEARS, which is below the national federal loans numbers (27k over 4years with interest make 31k at graduation.) That’s the amount a college graduate can reasonably expect to pay back over ten years.
Not 25-30 per year.
So, to go back: what can your parents pay if they don’t take loans for you? If they pay from their income and savings and use the college’s payment plan to spread payments over ten months, what can they pay per year?

34.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
Just got my Temple offer today: 33k, that’s without loans.

35.<<<jnkam24>>>
@Lehigh2022 that’s the cost or that’s the aid?  That would be ALOT of aid from Temple.

36.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@jnkam24 my bad that’s the cost, I got about 16k in aid.

37.<<<MYOS1634>>>
So, Temple is out of the picture.

38.<<<prezbucky>>>
How much are your parents willing to pay per year?
If they can pay $15k per year, adding the $5.5k student loan puts your annual budget at $20.5k. Adding a summer job maybe puts your budget st $25k.
With that budget, you could afford Nebraska, SDSU, SJSU, and UNR – including fees and reasonable travel costs. If you desired additional “pizza money” and it would take you over that $25k budget, you could take a part-time job during the school year.

39.<<<austinmshauri>>>
@Lehigh2022, What’s your EFC? If it’s low enough you may qualify for need based aid at some of your schools. Do you qualify for Pell and/or state grants, or is your family income too high?

40.<<<prezbucky>>>
I was vacantly watching a hockey game on TV just now and running through some numbers in my head.
This is not directly related to your ability to afford college, maybe, but it could be, and it certainly could improve your ability to have fun in college and provide for your future:
Let’s say you took a 15-hr (per week) job making $10/hour. Let’s say you’re at Nebraska and the state/local taxes are low-to-nil, so you’re keeping about $130 of that per week. That comes to about $550 per month (since months average more than four full weeks).
If you adopted a “spend half, save half” mentality, you could:

Spend an average of $65 per week. That could buy you five pizzas, or two pizzas and two movies, or two cheap dates, or one fancy date – every week. You could buy a soda now and then, chips, candy bar, whatever. Aside from adding some “fun/food money” to your college experience, it would also teach you how to plan and execute a budget, which is a valuable thing to learn. A lot of people don’t know how to do that, go into credit card and other types of debt, and it causes major problems.
Save an average of $65 per week. If you are on campus for 34 weeks out of the year, that’s right around $2200 in savings. Or maybe you spend a little less or make a little more money, so you’re saving $2500 per year. At graduation, you’d have $10,000.

That $10,000 is $10,000 worth of access to opportunity and added security. It can help you put down a down payment on a house, it can come in handy if you are out of work for months, you can take a piece of it and do some traveling, etc.

41.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri my efc is $60, I know it’s really low. I also got the Pell grant. I emailed temple and asked if they could raise my aid amount, and they sent me a form to fill out for reconsideration for more aid.

42.<<<austinmshauri>>>
If your EFC is &lt; $100, your parents likely can’t pay much and they shouldn’t borrow any. If they haven’t been able to save $80,000 for school, how do you expect them to repay that kind of money plus interest?
It appears to me that your resources are a ~$5900 Pell Grant + the $5500 student loan. That’s ~$11k. Do you have any schools whose net cost is within your budget? Look carefully at the packages to make sure they’re not already counting Pell and the loan.
Are there affordable schools in your home state of CA? Will you get any state grants if you attend one of them?

43.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri my efc is 60, but my family income is 80-90k, its weird I know but there is a reason to it. its complicated

44.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
See one of the things that I’m worried about is that the surrounding area of Temple is all that safe. While at Nebraska  it would seem a bit more safer to walk around after dark without having to worry like I probably would at Temple.

45.<<<washugrad>>>
Personally I think I’d recommend UNR over UNL (grew up in Omaha, currently live in the Bay Area, have several local friends whose kids are very happy at UNR).  But I don’t know much about business specifically.  Do you want to end up back in CA, or are you up in the air right now?

46.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^ The problem with UNR is lack of funding.
@Lehigh2022
You can’t walk off campus after dark  without a group or security escort at Temple.
Furthermore, it seems Nebraska is your only affordable option, right?
Where are you with financial aid packages and net cost at all of your acceptances?

47.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@MYOS1634 Wait is the are really that bad at Temple?

48.<<<MYOS1634>>>
North Philly about 2 streets away from campus is pretty sketchy. The campus is safe but despite considerable improvements it’s still Philly’s inner city.

49.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@MYOS1634 Would you consider Nebraska-Lincoln to be better overall than Nevada-Reno, more specifically in business? They both would cost the same for me.

50.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Yes, absolutely, in particular because of the terrible funding in Nevada.

51.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@MYOS1634 Would you say Nebraska is better overall than Temple? Also in terms of their respective business schools?

52.<<<MYOS1634>>>
I’m not sure, I’d think they’re probably the same.
Here’s the respective stats for the university overall. I don’t have the data for the business schools, perhaps they publish these on their respective websites.
Temple: 34% have a GPA over 3.75, average GPA is 3.56. Average ACT is 27, average SAT is 1180, with 25% above 1250/30, about 10% above 700 on either part of the SAT. 24% in top 10% of class.
38% small classes, 18% large to very large classes.
Nebraska: 39% have a GPA over 3.75, average GPA is 3.65, average ACT is 25, average SAT is 1150, with 25% 1280/29, about 13-14% above 700 on either part of the SAT. 24% in top 10% of class.
38% small classes, 24% large to very large classes.
Did you get into Honors at either one?

53.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
@austinmshauri Do think Nebraska is overall better than Temple, specifically in business?

54.<<<kidzncatz>>>
I’m not @austinmshauri and I don’t know whether Nebraska or Temple has the better business school.  I’m sure both of them are fine, but since you can’t afford Temple, it doesn’t really matter.  You keep asking for opinions about schools that should have been taken off the list as soon as you realized they would be too expensive.  Choose from Nebraska, UNR, or one of your instate schools.

55.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Basically you need comparisons between your affordable schools. Temple is similar to Nebraska, as you could see from the stats I gave. If it’s cheaper, it’s a better value.
Are you still waiting for acceptances.

56.<<<Lehigh2022>>>
I appealed my financial aid amount at temple, and they came back with an increase in aid so now it is affordable to me. Now that both Nebraska and temple are about the same, which one has a better reputation as an overall school because I see in terms and rankings, they are about the same but I feel that temple offers better employment opportunities based on its proximity to Phily and NYC.

57.<<<MYOS1634>>>
I tend to agree wrt employment opportunities but remember there’ll be a LOT more students vying for them.
Do you have housing at Temple? Because that’s another issue.

58.<<<jnkam24>>>
You said Nebraska was $18000-$20000 a year.  You said you could barely afford that.  You said temple was $33000 a year.  You say you appealed and Temple gifted you more aid as an OOS student making it equal in price to Nebraska.  Are you telling us that Temple handed you, an OOS student another $13000 A YEAR for a total of $52,000??  Sorry, I find this really hard to believe.  Clearly this thread is just going to keep going around in circles until someone tells you what you want to hear which is go to Temple.  So here it is.  Go to Temple.

59.<<<jnkam24>>>
I also recommend you research the cost of cross-country flights a few times a year and factor that into your costs.

60.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Two more things to consider:
Nebraska is in a tech triangle whereby a lot of start up tech companies without mega VC (or savvy about it) set up and hire graduates.
Housing is a big deal for Temple since you can’t live near campus. There’s a renovated block then you have to go farther away into the city and of course the nicer apartments aren’t cheap. (There’s why honors students having 4years of guaranteed housing is so important). So, investigate the housing situation.
List your exact package at your favorite CA school, temple, and Nebraska.
