Any feedback or comparisons socially, academically, outcomes, etc appreciated. My son has been committed to Duke but just came off Brown waitlist. Aspiring business/economics/entrepreneurial studies concentrations.

2.<<<JenniferClint>>>
Does he want to become an entrepreneur?

3.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
Both schools are excellent for economics. Brown will be easier due to grade inflation, if that matters to him. The schools are very different in terms of how academics are run (curves, grading, open vs more restricted curriculum) and especially how social life is (Duke is a big sports school - Brown is not, Duke has a more "traditional" college vibe, etc.).

Good performance at either school puts him in good positions fr grad school or employment after undergrad.

4.<<<privatebanker>>>
Brown does not have a business school. There is some cool entrepreneurial stuff going on there. Especially with life sciences and tech. But its an offshoot to other stem studies. Thayer street at brown is a fun strip of shops and restaurants. Brown interfuses with RISD students and old world New England architecture. Its a really a science meets hippy vibe. But theres also Ivy League prep and sporty types as well. Its quite a mix. Theres a nice quad and central campus but a lot of the school is woven into the surrounding area and sports gym pools a short walk from the rest. Its a really cool place to go to school and is pretty intellectually focused for sure.

Duke on the other hand is the traditional campus experience. Big time sports. School traditions. Tenting for tickets to the unc hoop game etc And a more homogenous preppy but also smart and serous student body. From s business standpoint
It has evolved into perhaps the most prestigious and well connected school in the country. Outside of hpys

5.<<<warblersrule>>>
I don't have much to add to the above, with the exception that
[quote]Back in late 90s, there was not much within walking distance outside Duke's campus.[/quote]
is no longer true, as places like Brightleaf Square and DPAC are within easy walking distance of East Campus. Durham has been revitalized and gentrified since the 1990s, as you probably know if you've visited Duke. (Almost too much so for some locals, as the skyrocketing rents and house prices in the area have been cause for concern.)

6.<<<ciervo>>>
Dont choose Brown expecting big grade inflation in economics or STEM courses. This seems to come up every time Brown is mentioned  but I dont think the people who spread that misinformation have much recent experience with Brown themselves.

There's no need for anyone to speculate either way, as Brown publishes its grade distributions. The 2016-17 data is below.

OP, congrats to your son! I'm not sure why, but I get the sense that Brown is the "it" school on CC (apart from Stanford, of course). You must be very proud. Be sure to let us know where he lands!

9.<<<JenniferClint>>>
One thing to consider is that Duke has significantly more money to throw at new entrepreneurial initiatives. In terms of resources, Duke has a definite advantage.

10.<<<Nocreativity1>>>
Thanks all for the great insights. USCwolverine I am indeed very proud about who he is as a person!

I suspect we will go visit Brown again for a walk around. Perhaps I was to harsh but whenever we would visit a school I would temper expectations of acceptance so not sure how "clear" my son's perspective was. He truly loved Duke so I suspect that is wear he decides but worth the ride to make sure he doesn't look back.

Thanks again.

11.<<<ccfk1221>>>
Brown has a unique feel and in terms of business/finance slightly better than Duke if he is looking to end up in NYC/Boston area

12.<<<gardenstategal>>>
Academically, it's a wash. The vibes, however, are really different. Lots of Greek life and sports-centered activities at Duke. I would be surprised if a student truly did not have a (strong) preference for one over the other - really different places.

I always suggest that students look at the course catalog and any general and departmental requirements and figure out, based on current interests, what 4 years would look like. There can be significant differences between otherwise similar schools which may or may not matter.

13.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
@ciervo

I am not spreading misinformation - it is undeniable that Brown has heavy grade inflation. It seems that across almost every academic stratification, around half or more of the students get an A and less than 10% get a C or lower. That is grade inflation no matter how you look at it.

Look @warblersrule 's post and Brown's own published grading policies.

14.<<<JenniferClint>>>
@ccfk1221 Do you have any data to back up the assertion that Brown has a slight edge over Duke for finance? The converse is almost certainly true.

<url>https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2015/02/04/the-top-feeder-schools-to-wall-street/2/</url>
Wall Street Oasis' list of undergraduate feeder schools has Duke at 29th globally (between Yale and Stanford). Brown doesn't make the top 50.

<url>https://poetsandquantsforundergrads.com/2014/10/10/linkedins-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-rankings/4/</url>
Linkedin has Duke 7th for finance. Brown is 17th.

etc. etc.

^ Registration is required

PS: If you think I'm cherry picking, it would be great if you could produce a single ranking that has Brown over Duke for finance (in terms of employment prospects).

15.<<<ciervo>>>
There is a degree of GPA inflation at Brown, for the reasons described by @lkjhgfdsa77756 above. Students can take almost unlimited classes as satisfactory/no credit . The deadline to drop a class is at the last day of classes. Also with no distribution requirements, students are largely taking classes they are excited to be in, rather than to fulfill requirements.

Brown only gives grades of A, B and C with no A- or B+, etc. so if a student doesnt get a 4.0 in the class, the next possible grade is a 3.0. So some students who are not getting As and in some cases, even Bs, will drop a class at the end of the semester rather than taking a grade that will substantially lower their GPA. Brown also does not give Ds and Fs. Any grade lower than a C and it's as if the class never existed on your transcript.

The A-B-C grade system also sometimes result in the cutoff for an A being a little more generous than at a school where the next lowest grade is a 3.7 rather than a 3.0. but, there is a degree of grade deflation as well when the student with a 3.6-3.7 average in the class gets a B/3.0 as a final grade.

GPA inflation is not the same thing as grade inflation in individual classes. The quality and quantity of work that is required to get an A in a class at Brown is not at some lower level than its peer schools. Like many peer schools, most classes at Brown don't have a bell curve distribution for assigning grades, so if 60% of the students do A level work then 60% of the students will get As. But students shouldn't choose Brown thinking it's going to be a lot easier to get an A than somewhere else.

16.<<<Publisher>>>
@cievro: Agree with everything in your post #16 in this thread except your last sentence.

17.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
@ciervo

All those reasons (the super lenient drop deadline, amount of pass/fail coursework allowed, no grade lower than a C showing up on your transcript, high percentage of As for classes, etc.) are exactly why I said that grade inflation exists at Brown. GPA inflation IS grade inflation (in fact, studies of grade inflation often use GPA distributions to measure grade inflation, or percentage of As - both of which is high at Brown).

Brown and Duke have the same quality of student - yet Duke students have a harder time getting As and higher GPAs.

The OP ought to be aware of this to make an educated decision. In some situations, such as Law School admissions, where GPA heavily influences admissions and the school attended is not sufficiently used to put GPAs in context, a school like Brown might be a strategic choice.

18.<<<whatthewhat>>>
I am not sure how this became a conversation about GPA as that has little bearing on the life of an entrepreneur. That said my student at Brown received funding for their business idea through some entrepreneurship program and there has been a lot start-up stuff on campus. Advising and summer program placement has also been above and beyond what we knew about before hand. Housing is not great though, so if really nice dorms is a deal breaker...

19.<<<ciervo>>>
I agree with you @yikesyikesyikes that it is easier to manipulate GPA at Brown than other places, and that GPA is the metric used In discussions of grade inflation. What I dont agree with is that it is easier to get high grades In individual classes at Brown than other peer schools, and that the caliber and quantity of work that it takes to get an A at Brown is substantially different from other schools.

20.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
@whatthewhat

I am not sure what you mean that "GPA has little bearing on the life of an entrepreneur". There is no singular career path for an entrepreneur - it looks different for everyone. GPA could be very important, not important at all, or somewhere in between.

21.<<<ccfk1221>>>
@JenniferClint there is no point going through these rankings as you see they are surprised Darmouth is so high but in front office NYC jobs you come across way more Brown and Dartmouth people than Duke for example. Dartmouth is in fact one of top schools wall street firms higher from...brown has excellent representation on wall street and is v entrepreneurial

22.<<<JenniferClint>>>
@ccfk1221 So your response is "trust me, I know what I'm talking about"? That's fine.

Can you name any prominent bulge bracket CEOs from Brown? Someone like John Mack or Alan Schwartz?

Probably worth noting that one of the most admired men on Wall Street (Jamie Dimon) chose to send his daughter to Duke.

23.<<<happy1>>>
^^Nobody should choose a school based on where Jamie Dimon (or anyone else) sends a child.

I'd recommend your S re-visit Brown and then decide. I think the two schools have somewhat different vibes and he should choose the one he feels more comfortable/happy with. Both are academically excellent.

24.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
@JenniferClint

Fair point perhaps, but Guggenheim Partners is not a Bulge Bracket.

Edit: forgot that he was also CEO of Bear Sterns (former BB), my apologies

who cares where jamie dimon sent his daughter...he will send her on mars and you will follow? how did that work out for schwartz at bear stearns...he did an amazing job...this discussion is ridiculous some top people in finance and tech from brown CEO of BOFA Moynihan is Brown alum, former Apple CEO and investor Sculley, Uber's new CEO etc

30.<<<JenniferClint>>>
@yikesyikesyikes Alan Schwarz was CEO of Bear Stearns (which was definitely considered BB). Bart McDade (tasked with saving Lehman) was also a Dukie.

@Nocreativity1 You haven't created any controversy. We're just making spirited arguments :)

31.<<<JenniferClint>>>
@ccfk1221 Apple and Uber are not financial services companies. Brian Moynihan is a fair response.

Sculley's tenure at Apple was not without its own share of controversy.

And if we're going to list random CEOs, then Duke can claim the current CEO of Apple (the most valuable company in the world), the current CEO of P&amp;G (10x more revenue than Uber), etc.

Also, back to banking. I want to throw some more names out there. Steven Black (former co-CEO of JP Morgan).

And this guy: <url>http://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-names-ashok-varadhan-sole-head-of-securities-2018-5</url>

Ashok Varadhan (head of Goldman's trading business; one of the firm's youngest ever partners).

32.<<<privatebanker>>>
Tim Cook went to Auburn undergrad. Duke business school.

Which is part of the point that fighting over which undergrad is better for success in life is essentially meaningless . All tech oriented business folks should go to auburn? or quit before you finish like gates jobs and zuckerberg. Or not go at all like Michael dell ?Well of course not.

And when comes to the splitting of hairs over Wall Street. How about Warren Buffett hes pretty well respected. University of Nebraska and heres what he has to say on the matter.

When Warren Buffett is looking at hiring a new employee or finding a new company to invest in, he has a lot of criteria. But, one thing he isn't looking for are fancy university degrees.
"I don't care where someone went to school, and that never caused me to hire anyone or buy a business," Buffett says 

Go where you like and do the best you can! Duke is great. Brown is great. Auburn is great. University of Nebraska is great. Any top 150 schools in America are unique gifts.

33.<<<JenniferClint>>>
Are you really saying that an Auburn degree has the same value as a Princeton degree? You can do well anywhere but certain schools maximize your odds of succeeding.

34.<<<privatebanker>>>
I get your point and its valid. But not necessarily the exact way many would perceive it to be.

My answer to your question, is that In the hands of the right student an Auburn degree can most definitely be as valuable. Ie Tim Cook and countless others. But the average Princeton student (versus Princeton as an entity) is so darn smart they will succeed at a higher frequency than most other students, especially in certain academically rigorous professions such as advanced science and research medicine &amp; academia. Highly selective undergraduate recruiting also benefits the Ivy Leaguer.

But after that first job or the professional school admittance - the advantages dissipate. There is loads of research on the pay gap initially enjoyed by the ivy level grad disappeaing over time. It soon becomes more about the indiovud than the college advantage.

I also think the Princeton grad has the advantage when there is a virtual tie for a promotion or when competing for a position. But as Marilyn Monroe. stated. Looks are great but after two minutes youre on your own. Such is life and such is the ug presitige advantage.

35.<<<ccfk1221>>>
and the guy who is leaving is from Brown...the discussion is pointless, personally i dont care which school who went and all i can say that recruiting at brown is as good if not better for finance and its closer to nyc and boston so getting internships is easier too

36.<<<whatthewhat>>>
@yikesyikesyikes entrepreneurs tend to trade more in what they have accomplished and pedigree than their GPA in my experience. What you hear all the time in the incubators is people described like "she's a Haas MBA from Google peddling her second social media app" or "he has exited 3 start ups" maybe there is a GPA story buried underneath all of that but it is quickly buried by resume.

37.<<<mdphd92>>>
Is it the student or is it the college that results in career success? Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger performed a careful analysis of this question in 2002, and concluded that "Students who attended more selective colleges do not earn more than other students who were accepted and rejected by comparable schools but attended less selective colleges. ... These results are consistent with the conclusion of Hunt's seminal research: 'The C student from Princeton earns more than the A student from Podunk not mainly because he has the prestige of a Princeton degree, but merely because he is abler. The golden touch is possessed not by the Ivy League College, but by its students.'"

In other words, for career success as measured by salary, then for a given student, it turns out not to matter what college the student attends. It is the student's own abilities and personal traits that, in general, will determine his or her success.

38.<<<Nocreativity1>>>
Mdphd2- while interesting and flattering that my son will be successful regardless...

My question is intended to elicit commentary from students or parents of students who have attended either Duke or Brown and wish to share their experience. Thanks.

39.<<<mdphd92>>>
@Nocreativity1 Sorry, the whole discussion got sidetracked about larger issues, which is what drew me in. I don't have anything to say about either Duke or Brown. They both seem like very good schools. All I can say is that studies show that your son's choice of college probably won't affect his career earnings. However, that doesn't say anything about his experience for the next 4 years.

My only advice, which addresses the academic experience and not the social experience, would be for your son to read the course catalogs of the two universities and try to make up a 4-year schedule for each. Are there courses or programs that seem more appealing at one versus the other? Brown offers an Open Curriculum, which gives students a lot of choice, but is that something that your son would take advantage of? On the other hand, Duke has more traditional General Education requirements, and maybe those classes seem more in line with your son's preferences. Perhaps your son's anticipated major has more advanced electives at one university compared with the other, or a more well thought-out introductory series.

Best of luck with his decision!

40.<<<Nocreativity1>>>
Regrettably his choice also won't effect what it costs me.

No problem at all and in fact your content was interesting. Thanks for taking the time to respond.

41.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
@whatthewhat

Yes, but at this stage in the OP's son's career, we cannot just ignore the effect of GPA. What if he wants to go to grad school right after undergrad (some entrepreneurs chose to pursue a JD, Master in Business Analytics, MFin, MFE, etc.)?

Also, applications of entrepreneurship extend beyond the startup world. I find it interesting that you mentioned startups. One of the most important players in the startup world are VC/PE (Venture Capital/Private Equity) firms and Investment Banks (who handle M&amp;A, IPOs, underwriting, etc.). These firms care a lot about GPA for the limited undergrad recruitment they do. Financing (both buy-side and sell-side) play a huge role in the startup world and the OP's son may be interesting in pursuing that as someone studying Econ. Both schools are excellent choices for this career path and have different strengths in this regard. One of Brown's strengths is less worrying about GPA. OP + son should weigh the benefits of each school and decide accordingly.

42.<<<Postmodern>>>

46.<<<jym626>>>
And Re: post# 13: The Poets and Quants site provides information about MBA programs. Its completely irrelevant for undergrad information/decisions.

47.<<<PeaceOfMind>>>
I think we are splitting hairs here. Both institutions offer more than enough opportunities for the student to pursue a variety of careers in business, entrepreneurship, etc. What would make the difference is the extent to which the student immerses himself in the many opportunities available at both institutions. And so perhaps the deciding factor would be how the student perceives the environment at the two institutions. References to alum who are celebrities in business and other walks of life seem a highly suspect and circum circuitous way to judge an institution.

48.<<<jym626>>>
Greek life is a much bigger part of campus life at Duke than at Brown. If fraternities and sororities are or are not important to you, consider that.

49.<<<Postmodern>>>
Thank you @ciervo !

50.<<<Sunny66>>>
Both are great schools and I know nice and successful people from both. I do not think there is a measurable difference in outcomes. I would focus on social fit. I think the strong Greek presence at Duke compared to Brown is a distinguishing factor, as is the bigger-time sports. Brown's sports teams on balance are not strong, though some are obviously better than others. Brown is more like a LAC with its strong undergraduate focus (no law school, no business school). Brown students are known for being happy there.

51.<<<JenniferClint>>>
The Wall Street Journal ranked Duke first (tied with Harvard) for student outcomes. Brown doesn't make the top 25. I would argue that there is a measurable difference in outcomes but I understand that my opinion is an unpopular one.

@jym626 The links I provided in post #13 specifically reference undergrad (NOT B-school).

52.<<<Postmodern>>>
@JenniferClint , I can't find the metric they use for "outcomes". What are thy measuring there exactly?

53.<<<JenniferClint>>>
"For graduate outcomes, the rankings take into account graduation rates, the salaries that graduates own and the debt they carry."

@Postmodern Thank you for responding with a request for clarification instead of a knee-jerk reaction :)

54.<<<yikesyikesyikes>>>
@JenniferClint

I might be misunderstanding the ranking, but isn't Brown ranked 11?

55.<<<Postmodern>>>
"Postmodern Thank you for responding with a request for clarification instead of a knee-jerk reaction "

@JenniferClint it was a sincere question. I can't have a proper reaction if I don't understand. And I greatly appreciate your in-kind response! I have a kid heading to Brown in the fall which is why your link and the one Ciervo kindly pointed me to were of interest.

56.<<<JenniferClint>>>
@yikesyikesyikes Brown is 11th overall (Duke is 5th) but it doesn't make the top 25 in the "outcomes" category. This is what that category measures:

"Does the college generate good and appropriate outputs? Does it add value to the students who attend? The Outcomes area represents 40 per cent of the overall ranking. Within this we look at:

Graduation rate (11%)
Value added to graduate salary (12%)
Value added to loan default (7%)
Academic reputation (10%)"

57.<<<Nocreativity1>>>
Brown won the day by a slight margin based on fit. To be honest lots of discussion about results but my kid is pretty confident that he can be successful from either school. Loves the idea of Brown's open curriculum and believes that the classroom environment will have kids that all want to be in the room. Hated the idea of 3 semesters of language when he could engage in other subjects of greater interest.

Thank you all for your input.

58.<<<prezbucky>>>
These are academic peers but they're so different overall, as the pages of well informed knowledge have reflected.

Duke will likely be harder -- you can't take classes P/F, they don't have nearly the level of grade inflation that Brown has, and the academic vibe is more competitive generally. How you think about Brown's laid-back academic vibe is up to you. I like rigor, and you can find it at Brown, but to do so would mean having a plan to not take any classes P/F, to take hard classes per se, and to work hardinspite of the inflation.

Sports: Duke is huge; Brown is not.

Greek life: Duke has it; Brown either does not or it is limited.

Weather differences are obvious.

Brown is quite liberal; Duke is more balanced.

In context, Brown is like a cross between a liberal LAC and Cornell or Princeton. Duke is essentially a cross between Dartmouth and Stanford on the Atlantic Coast.

They are very different schools.

If it were my decision I'd choose Duke for the (more...) real-world rigor and competition, balanced vibe, sports atmosphere, and because I might not trust myself to design my own curriculum and decide whether to take courses P/F or actually work for a grade ("work" being used relatively and nominally).

But that's just me -- your preferences and weaknesses may be different.

59.<<<JenniferClint>>>
Decision has been made. I'm sure the OP's son will take advantage of Brown's open curriculum and live up to his academic potential. Godspeed!
