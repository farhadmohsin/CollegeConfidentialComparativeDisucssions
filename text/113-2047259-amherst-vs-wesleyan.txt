Hi guys!
I am a current high school senior from a medium-sized public school in North Carolina. I was recently accepted to both Amherst College and Wesleyan University! I am absolutely ecstatic about this, as they were two of my top schools, but as such, I am having a very difficult time choosing between the two. I was wondering if any of you could help me out!
For a bit of background, I’m not entirely sure what I want to major in yet, but I am extremely interested in psychology, neuroscience, economics, and social thought. I am looking for a very rigorous education with active professors, regardless of what I major in. However, I am also a very artistic person. I have been playing guitar since I was 10 and was in a band for all of high school. I also absolutely adore theater, I’ve been a part of almost every single show through my high school’s theater program, and would really like to continue this in college.
Additionally, my family is not wealthy by any means. I would receive very close to full scholarships from both schools, so this makes money not much of an issue for either, but may possibly factor into how I fit in socially? I’m honestly not sure. I am also looking for a school with things to do in the surrounding area, and a relatively active social scene in that regard.
tl;dr - I am a motivated high school student with passions for both the arts and sciences. What are y’all’s thoughts on both Wesleyan and Amherst? Thanks so much!

Wesleyan’s student body is quirkier and artsier overall, although of course not every student fits that description. Amherst has a much smaller enrollment and a much bigger endowment per student.  Sports teams are very prominent on campus.  More students as a percentage of student body are on financial aid at Amherst than Wesleyan.
As for location, Amherst is in a nice college town with a great downtown and four other colleges nearby.  Wesleyan is in a suburban town with a small downtown area and no other colleges nearby.

3.<<<Yaskwhy>>>
Have you visited both schools? I’m familiar with both, and given your self-description, I’d pick Wesleyan in a heartbeat. While it’s true that Amherst is close to two great downtown areas (Amherst and Northampton), within the 5-college area, Amherst College stands out as the least politically progressive institution. The student body at Amherst stands out as quite financially and socially entitled. The academics are top-notch, but it’s hard to imagine you’d actually be comfortable there.
Good luck!

4.<<<circuitrider>>>
Amherst has made great strides in admitting greater percentages of students from lower income households, but Wesleyan is the larger school and so is liable to have a larger actual number of students that fit that description. Also, Middletown’s downtown is much more diverse. I counted at least four different Asian restaurants on my last visit (Szechuan, Tibetan, Vietnamese and Thai) among many other dining establishments.

5.<<<BookLvr>>>
They are both EXCELLENT choices!
I agree with the advice to visit both schools. I would also research the faculty at both schools.
I agree Wesleyan is artsier and probably has the better theater scene.
To me, Amherst is the quintessential college town, and is part of the 5 college system which also includes Northampton, another great college town.
I disagree that a student with high financial need would feel uncomfortable at Amherst. As @brantly points out above, a higher percentage of the student body at Amherst receives FA than at Wesleyan. 20-25% of the Amherst student body is Pell eligible. Amherst was one of the first elite liberal arts colleges to make significant strides to increase its number of lower income students. This was a very important initiative during the presidency of Anthony Marx and got a lot of positive write-ups in major newspapers. So while yes, there are no doubt some wealthy and privileged students at Amherst (AND at Wesleyan), there are plenty of lower income students as well. It is not rare at all.
Amherst is also quite a progressive school in a very progressive town. It is a school that definitely believes in hearing things from all sides. John Kasich recently spoke on the Amherst campus, much to the consternation of some student groups.
Good luck with this choice. You really cannot go wrong with either school!

6.<<<ReCorc3>>>
Thank you for your help! I have only visited Amherst, and going in completely blind to the social atmosphere, I actually liked it a lot! It’s been my top out of all of the schools I’ve visited thus far, albeit not many. I’m trying to visit Wesleyan at some point within the next month, before I have to actually make a decision, but living so far away I might not be able to. Would you say that the Amherst student body is politically and socially progressive? I think I could be comfortable going to school with people from a different financial background, as long as they were open to understanding where I, and others, are coming from. Also, would you happen to know where both Amherst and Wesleyan fall in terms of racial diversity and acceptance? Again, thank you so much!

You are very fortunate to have this choice! Having spent time in both Middletown and Amherst in the last year, I’d say the Town of Amherst and the entire Pioneer Valley have A LOT more to offer to the college set.  The area caters to over 30,000 undergrads within about 10 miles of each other with a robust free bus system and myriad choices of restaurants, shops, bars and music venues. The Town of Amherst and nearby Northampton are quintessential New England college towns. The Pioneer Valley area certainly has more varied and diverse restaurant choices than Middletown.  Within one mile of the Amherst College campus, there are 44 different restaurants including Tibetan, Vietnamese, Taiwanese, Japanese, Himalayan, Nepalese, Peruvian, Mexican and a brand new Korean fried chicken.  Downtown Northampton offers even more dining choices.

My daughter was blessed to get into both of these wonderful schools last year. Her interests at the time were not dissimilar to yours. Up to that point in her life, she’d never been faced with a more difficult decision than having to turn down such wonderful schools like Wesleyan, for Amherst College.
IMHO Wesleyan is a theatre person’s dream! Lin Manuel Miranda and so very many more of their talented and successful Alumni have become such a force in the entertainment industry and this makes opportunities for internships and networking, rich and exciting. Also this year former Governor Hickenlooper of Colorado has thrown his hat in the ring as a Presidential candidate. He is a very smart and succesful businessman who has an interesting autobiography that speaks to the time spent and many people he met while attending school there.
Amherst is magical. I know, I know. It is not perfect, but the education and resources are incredible. My daughter has not had an easy first year. Health issues, housing issues, but once she sets foot in the classroom, she is in her element, she has found her people. And no they aren’t all just like her. She has friends and classmates that are conservative politically and although she is not, the brilliant discussions and intelligent arguments made are very stimulating to her. These are her people. Not necessarily all the same opinions or beliefs, but so very interesting and bright. This has been the highlight of our facetime conversations with her.
She loves most of the professors and her hard work is rewarded well in high marks. The emails and attention professors give her is beyond what she received from her public high school education. She has had opportunities to participate in a book club at the home of the President of Amherst College and has had professors give her books during office hours that they thought she would enjoy. Her Advisor has also had her and his other students over to his home for dinner.
The towns are not in big cities. Neither one is going to be Los Angeles or New York kind of exciting. Amherst is a quaint little New England town. Most of the fun happens on campus at Amherst and occasionally at one of the other schools in the Five College Consortium.
Go visit. It is a must to attend Admitted Students days for both. They really do it right. You will have a feeling as to what your future possible classmates may be like. You will get a vibe of the current students and campus. You will make the right choice. Congratulations!

12.<<<anon145>>>
@ReCorc3  Amherst basically invented the Neuroscience major for undergrads (1973);  also not sure about Wesleyan but Amherst doesn’t have general ed. requirements so a lot of students double major.
https://collegenews.org/x6333/
Also, one of my favorite tools is from the NY times,  it’s stunning how rich the households kids are at nearly all private schools in top 50.  Amherst 21% (630,000$ +) . but Wesleyan 17%.  Basically any elite private school has insanely rich households 15% (Harvard) -23%(vanderbilt) in this top 1%/$630K+ . all the Ivies and most NESCACs in between.
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/college-mobility/wesleyan-university

13.<<<ReCorc3>>>
@anon145 Thank you so much for that information! I had genuinely no idea. $630,000 is unfathomable to me. It’s about 1/20th of what my parents made last year. However, knowing that the population of very rich students is similar across the majority of top schools does actually make this decision a bit easier, thank you!

Sure, but, that doesn’t mean you can just show up, audition and grab a leading role. As the state flagship university in the consortium, UMass (with a 4:1 enrollment advantage) makes clear on their department’s FAQ:

[quote]
Yes! You must audition if you want to be in one of our productions. And yes, you do have a chance at being cast as a freshman, a minor, or a non-major. That said, we don’t want to create an expectation that you’ll get the lead role your first time out. A strong work ethic, a willingness to learn, and a commitment to working supportively with the rest of the cast and creative team are really important to us. If you approach this discipline seriously, and we see that you’re ready to take on the challenge of a particular part, you will be cast.

My takeaway: Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the UMass campus making a good impression.

@ReCorc3  “$630,000 is unfathomable to me. It’s about 1/20th of what my parents made last year.”
Your parents made $12.6 million last year? Good on them! 

16.<<<ReCorc3>>>
@JenniferClint Oh my gosh, I meant they made about 1/20th of that, lol

17.<<<anon145>>>
yes @ReCorc3  the top 1% is insanely rich to most of us.   In a way the tuition is way too high at these schools for 80% of the kids but is probably too low for the 20% ish that come from $630K a year families.  this NY times tool is really interesting for those who haven’t typed in your favorite schools and looked around.

Cal Berkeley is only 3.8% from the top 1%,   UNC chapel hill 6% (guessing mostly OOS)

Take a read of the truly inspiring story (granted from 2007) of Anthony Jack (now a Harvard professor and author) that an Amherst parent posted elsewhere on CC: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/education/27grad.html.

21.<<<privatebanker>>>
If the student body was protesting a very centrist John Kasich coming to speak, I wouldn’t worry at all it being too conservative. Lol.
The Amherst and Northampton region literally couldn’t be more progressive and inclusive.

22.<<<OHMomof2>>>
@privatebanker I’m pretty sure there was no protest for Kasich, or Charles Krauthammer either.
Amherst and Northampton are most definitely progressive and inclusive.
But let’s get to the really important stuff!

[quote]
Middletown’s downtown is much more diverse. I counted at least four different Asian restaurants on my last visit (Szechuan, Tibetan, Vietnamese and Thai) among many other dining establishments.
[/quote]

Amherst has about 12 Asian restaurants.  Vietnamese, Thai, Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese and many more that are just generally Asian (like Crazy Noodles). Then there’s Mexican, Middle Eastern, Indian, Persian, Spanish (plus multiple  Puerto Rican restaurants in Holyoke). I noticed that South Hadley, where Mount Holyoke is, even has a West African restaurant now. And Northampton has too many restaurants of every type for me to count.

23.<<<privatebanker>>>
@OHMomof2   I was only referencing @BookLvr ‘a post.
“Amherst is also quite a progressive school in a very progressive town. It is a school that definitely believes in hearing things from all sides. John Kasich recently spoke on the Amherst campus, much to the consternation of some student groups.”

24.<<<circuitrider>>>
^Look, Let’s not get crazy here. I was just including restaurants that are within easy walking distance of the Wesleyan campus, not the entire city which stretches for miles. And, what I said is true. Downtown Middletown is a mosaic of white ethnic, African-American residents and recent arrivals from Asia, South Asia and beyond. And, against all odds, they seem to get along famously. When I stay overnight there I am struck by the number of total strangers who nod “Good morning”, as I make my way, window shopping or stopping for coffee at any number of owner-operated shops, bakeries, or diners. Middletown’s Main Street literally extends one mile from one end to the other.

25.<<<Meddy>>>
Anthony Jack was back at Amherst last month speaking to fellow mammoths about The Privileged Poor and sitting in on classes. He spoke about lobbying for some of the things that are now in place on campus, like leaving the cafeteria open on breaks. Progress has been made, but much more will happen as students speak up and help in the development of better practices and solutions.

I still count 12 Asian restaurants in downtown Amherst. And forgot the Tibetan one. The Hot Pot place is a mile away but the rest are within a half mile (10 city blocks) and most much closer - about 1/4.
Google map it 

27.<<<merc81>>>
With respect to food, I’m inclined toward Wesleyan:
https://vegnews.com/2017/3/the-10-most-vegan-friendly-colleges

28.<<<privatebanker>>>
Wesleyan for food over Amherst. No way. Not these days. The knowledgeable Amherst undergrad takes a high level something at the University. Preferably around lunchtime.  U Massachusetts at Amherst has the the finest in campus dining options in the country.  Plus the Amherst proper options.
It is also a home run for access to lab research and CS/AI and grad school level classes in all disciplines.  Completely available to a Jumbo formerly known as Jeff.

29.<<<circuitrider>>>
I took your advice, @OHMomof2  , but google-mapped Middletown for good measure and discovered that there are 15 Asian restaurants within a half mile of Wesleyan, including two Thai, two Japanese, and one Tibetan and Vietnamese a piece. I even subtracted a couple of possibilities I thought might be in questionable locations like a strip mall no one would actually try to reach by foot. All in all, I forced myself to stop counting at 100 restaurants technically within the Middletown city limits.
And, yes, @privatebanker, I understand. Amherst undergraduates have been known to try all sorts of things to avoid the food at Valentine - even taking a course at another school.

30.<<<Mastadon>>>
@anon145  $630,000 represents the top 1% of incomes.  If that is stunning, then …
The NY Times tool also contains data for the number of students from the top .1% of incomes.
In both of these schools the number of students from the top .1% is about equal the number from the bottom 20%.
At Amherst, 4.4% come from the top .1%  - while  4% come from bottom 20%
At Wesleyan, 4.1% come from the top .1%  - while 4.5% come from the bottom 20%

31.<<<Regulus7>>>
Both schools are great.  My oldest daughter is a junior at Wes and my niece is a sophomore at Amherst.  Overall, I think it really depends on the type of person you are. My daughter is an extrovert and is super involved across campus on so many things that she is just so busy and loving it.  My niece is a bit more studious and not as involved. We had her over for her spring break.  She has never left the Amherst campus. She does not care about the 5 college exchange and said she never intends to use any of the resources outside of Amherst.  But, nevertheless she loves Amherst.  She is a science kid and is very focused on her studies (environmental science).  Listening to the two of them talk about their respective campus experience, my daughter at Wes has a group of friends that love to talk about social justice, politics and just stream of consciousness type of intellectual topics, and it happens all the time.  My niece and her friends are more focused on their specific classes and group projects.  This does not imply that there is less intellectual curiosity at Amherst, rather that it really depends on your type of personality and friend group.  My niece is not much of a sports person and she did comment that a lot of socializing does revolve around sports as so many students are athletes that friends usually go to home games. Sports… this is a concept my daughter does not seem to know much about at Wes

35.<<<TheGreyKing>>>
@ReCorc3 - Congratulations! Those are two wonderful choices where you can’t go wrong! Everything you say you want from professors, etc., is present at both colleges. Based on what you have written, I think you would be happy at either college.
Both schools do a good job of including students at all financial levels, giving generous aid, etc. Both have a mostly campus-centric social life with lots of free events, so I do not think that either would be more difficult than the other for a student of limited financial means.
Both would qualify as “open,” “racially diverse,” and “progressive.”  Both have the same predominant liberal attitudes that categorize most top small northeastern liberal arts colleges. Wesleyan is a bit more known for protests and a progressive, edgy vibe than Amherst.
Both will have a strong arts scene, and you will be able to enjoy your theatre and music interests at both, but Wesleyan is particularly well-known for its alumni in theatre, TV, and film. Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote “In the Heights” as his senior project there.
Amherst- a truly open curriculum. Take only what you want to take, in classes with students who want to be there.
Lots of red brick.
College town in an area with some mountains.
5-college consortium provides additional options for courses, clubs, and socialization. (It includes two all-women’s colleges, so add some points for dating opportunities if you are a heterosexual male or homosexual female!)
Wesleyan-  for honors, you will need to fill some distribution requirements, but they are not too onerous.
Eclectic architecture.
Suburban town.
Nearer to New York City, if that matters to you.
Glad you can visit!  They are similar enough in all that matters, so you can just trust your gut reaction. Which feels best?
Lots of luck!

36.<<<OHMomof2>>>
@circuitrider  we both learned something new! Now I’m hungry 
I have eaten at Val several times. I think it’s great. Farm to table (they have their own farm) fresh stuff, and things are cooked and seasoned well. Tons of options. I think the idea that it’s not good is the fact that there is just the one dining hall and understandably kids get tired of it.

37.<<<OwlOfAthena>>>

@circuitrider Interesting observation about Middletown. The couple times I was there, it kind of reminded me of a town straight out of a John Melloncamp song. Gun shop, pickup trucks, American flags waving. It seemed a stark contrast to the left leaning vibe at Wes!

Middletown has changed quite a bit in the last twenty years. The old North End still resembles that Mellencamp song. People of all colors still line up early in the morning for clothing and a hot meal at the St. Vincent de Paul mission. And, though it is clearly discouraged by the local constabulary (whose headquarters are cleverly camouflaged to resemble a bar/restaurant), people may still be observed panhandling (which they do in Northampton, too, except, they’re called “street artists” when they do it.) I would still run the gauntlet, if need be, for breakfast at O’Rourke’s, probably one of the best known diners in New England (just be sure to get there before 3:00PM when it begins to shut down.)
The other end of Main Street (which runs for about ten blocks from end to end) has been almost completely suburbanized. Historic homes have been hauled into place like chess pieces; Wesleyan helped bring in a four-star hotel to host visiting professors; and, the old apartment-above-the-store streetscape has been replaced by modern facades with gabled roofs.
In between those two poles, on any weekday evening, you can see cars parked perpendicularly for blocks as people from the surrounding towns of Portland, Berlin, Haddam and Cromwell come to dine out or to perhaps make a detour for a little froyo before heading home. Over the years, Middletown has definitely become the unofficial county seat for that part of Connecticut.

43.<<<OHMomof2>>>
You’ve got me interested in stopping in Middletown the ext time I pass by @circuitrider !
However, I take issue with this:

[quote]

[/quote]

There are panhandlers in Northampton, they are asking for money, straight up. They may ask, they may sit with signs, but they are asking for you to give them money because they are down and out or whatever.
Street artists are playing music or painting with chalk or whatever they are doing, with some kind of vessel that people can put money into. They are entertaining you and if you want to support them, you can.
There is a difference.

44.<<<Lynnski>>>
I don’t know where the assertion about “street artists” is coming from. Panhandling in downtown Northampton (where I’ve lived for more than 20 years) is a serious issue with just about everyone, as it pits the economic interests of the community against the progressive ethos of the same community. I’ve never heard anyone here try to cover up the issues by calling folks street artists.

45.<<<Trixy34>>>
Wesleyan - you’ll have the resources and flexibility there to pursue whatever you want to study.

46.<<<CottonTales>>>
@Trixy34, not sure what your comment means. Amherst has the ultimate flexibility to study whatever you want. You have to take a freshman seminar and the other 31 classes are up to you, no core whatsoever. Amherst definitely has the resources as well.

47.<<<HPTD12>>>
Amherst has a much higher endowment per student than Wesleyan and that will translate into more academic and EC opportunities

48.<<<chameleon>>>
Many years ago I placed my deposit at Amherst, but I changed my mind after a fortuitous conversation with a concerned adult, and I wound up going to Wesleyan. I only placed my deposit at Amherst because it was atop the LAC rankings at the time, and I was off at boarding school and caught up in the rankings silliness. Deep down inside, however, I knew Wes was a better fit; I came from a relatively homogenous high school, and I wanted something different in college. At that time, Wes was clearly a better fit, both by the numbers, and in terms of actual feel. Today, Amherst at least rivals Wes by the numbers, and on paper, it exceeds it in terms of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic diversity indicators. That said, the numbers only tell part of the story. I applied to college pre-internet and I never saw any of the schools I applied to until the day I moved in as a freshman. I knew Edward’s B. Fiske’s (Wes Alum, by the way) Selective Guide to Colleges like the back of my hand.  Today, the info I have gleaned from that guide, conversations with alum and current students at both schools, Niche, Unigo, etc., lead me to conclude that, while both places have evolved, they have not really changed that much in terms of where they fall on the campus climate spectrum. As I help youngsters navigate the process you are going through right now, I am struck by how long it takes for the culture and/or climate of an academic institution to evolve. Amherst may be more heterogenous than it was a few decades ago, but at its core, it still has some way to go before its ‘inclusion’ ranking matches its diversity numbers. Wesleyan may not be as ‘progressive’ as it once was, but at its core, it comes much closer to living up to the ‘diversity university’ moniker frequently associated with it than so may other schools its size. Similarly, institutions like Colby, Middlebury, and Hamilton, for example, are more diverse than they once were, but how much those institutions have ‘really’ changed is up for debate. How much any of that matters to you is something only you can decide. As others have pointed out, you can get a superb education at either place. If it matters to you (not that I get the sense it does), Wesleyan has fallen even further behind in the rankings. For what its worth, I’d be less reluctant to go to Amherst today, but mostly because I’d graduate with no loans to repay. Best of luck to you in your decision making process!

49.<<<waverlywizzard>>>
I am not quite sure what that is based on other than decades old feeling stemming from one’s own admission experience. Times change, and some institutions have indeed. The president of Amherst has long committed to increasing and sustaining Diversity in ways that other NESCAC schools simply have not. You should visit, talk to recent grads, students of color and make decisions that are based less on conjecture.

50.<<<AmazingBlue>>>
I’ve recently been back to both Middletown and Amherst after being away for decades.  I was pleasantly surprised by both.
Middletown never really felt “suburban” to me.   it felt like a small New England city fallen on hard times.  In the 1980s there were a handful of nice places to go, but not many.  Middletown now feels much more economically diverse, in the sense that there are people walking around who are not affiliated with Wesleyan but have plenty of money to spend.  As people have observed, there are several kinds of restaurants and other shops in Middletown.  They’re selling things like fancy chocolates and cool clothes   But I still think Middletown has much less nightlife than one might want.  (Wesleyan may offer it’s own nightlife.)
In the 1980s, most visitors would have thought that Amherst was “nicer” than Middletown, especially if you liked stores and shops that sold expensive housewares and preppy clothes.  Back then, I had an extremely negative reaction to Amherst.  It seemed extremely precious and dull.  But now it feels more vibrant.  It’s still very beautiful but now there are more kinds of people on the streets, more ethnic restaurants, etc.  That said, the town still has a fantasy land quality to it.  There are very few poor people around.  Northampton feels more like a real city and it’s a short drive away.
One thing that has changed the town of Amherst is the evolution of the student bodies at UMass and Amherst College.  UMass feels more like a big time state university than it did back then.  And Amherst has a vastly more diverse student body than it did back then.

51.<<<AmazingBlue>>>
Question: Does Amherst produce alumni who go into the performing arts?  Wesleyan and Amherst both have amazingly impressive Wikipedia pages listing alumni, but Wesleyan seems to have far more musicians and actors in its list.  Amherst has far fewer under the age of 50.

52.<<<circuitrider>>>
I think a lot of this can be traced back to choices each college made back when they decided to go co-ed (Wesleyan for the second time) in the late 1960s. Both were very concerned that they would not be able to pull enough overlaps from the Seven Sisters, widely considered the female equivalent of the Ivy League. This impacted Amherst in particular since it was identified so closely with Smith and Mt. Holyoke. So, it spent many years recruiting women by holding total enrollment at 1200 students by cutting the number of males. My sense is that the women were expected to match the same academic profile as their male counterparts and were heavily weighted in favor of the social sciences and English.
Wesleyan which was swimming in money, thanks to some canny investments in tech stocks (sound familiar?), made a much different calculation. The closest female college was Vassar, some eighty miles away. A tiny, all-male college by comparison, steeped in a kind of pious, Prescott Bush-style Republicanism, Wesleyan could afford to “go big”. And high on its to-do list was an expansion of its arts offerings. The result was a mammoth architectural undertaking by a prestige firm (headed by perhaps the prestige architect of his time, Kevin Roche), the Wesleyan Center for the Arts (CFA). I don’t think anyone anticipated at the time the profound effect a capital investment would have on the number of both men and women who would find themselves attracted to the arts while at Wesleyan over the next forty years.

If financial resources of each school are a consideration, Amherst’s endowment of $2.4 billion certainly outpaces Wesleyan’s $1 billion despite having 1000 fewer students.
@ReCorc3 Has a decision been made?

@AmazingBlue Yes, Amherst does produce alumni that go into the performing arts. I have seen where they even have Open Auditions on campus for plays that alumni are producing. So, having alumni in the arts is one thing, having them active at their alma mater is even better. The Five College Consortium also adds additional opportunities at the other campuses for auditions and classes.
Wesleyan has long been known as the place to be for undergrad film studies and they have quite the active alumni network in entertainment. It has a top 10 program film program which if I’m not mistaken was birthed by the iconic Professor Basinger, who I believe has recently passed on the torch, but may still have ties to the program  Most recently you will hear of Lin-Manuel Miranda giving back to his alma mater. I think their opportunities in the arts are pretty rich.
As with any school, it’s what you make of it. I love Amherst. Wesleyan for undergraduate film studies is tough to beat.

Well, hold on. If instructional budgets are any consideration (and, why would they not; these are colleges, not sports camps), Wesleyan outspends Amherst by nearly 2:1. According to their respective 2017 Annual Reports, the latest available for both colleges, Wesleyan spent $103,700,000 on the broad category of “instruction” while Amherst spent only $56,000,000.

As a Williams grad, I’d say these two excellent LACs are so close and for OP there is no wrong choice. Hopefully, he/she has had an opportunity to visit both and the decision has already been made.  Last year, my D almost had to make a choice between Amherst and Williams. That might have set off some real fireworks here on CC…much less in our home!
One observation: Wesleyan’s 2018 operating budget is larger at $225 million vs. Amherst’s operating budget of $189 million.  Note however that Amherst has a student population of a little over 1800 while Wesleyan has nearly 3000.

@anon145
But you left out the fact that Amherst has almost 25% of its students from the bottom 60%, with incomes less than 65k. That’s a much higher % than most if not virtually all peer schools.

This is an old post, I know, but it’s about a topic that matters to a lot of people.
A lot of college rankers say Amherst and Williams are the best two liberal arts colleges in America, with Wesleyan ranked a bunch of spots lower, but spend a few minutes comparing the Wikipedia pages for the Little Three, and then check out the lists of alumni.  All three lists are really impressive, but if you spend time reading about the alumni in more artistic and public service oriented fields, Wesleyan really seems to stand out.
If nobody told you that Wesleyan was supposed to be in third place, well behind Amherst and Williams, would you think it was in third place based on the descriptions of the programs or the alumni lists?  I doubt it.  (I guess you might if you were more focused on finance and industry, but I’m not even sure about that.)
Also if you watch videos of students at the Little Three, the Wesleyan ones just seem a little more entertaining.  Having an extra 1000 students at Wesleyan must make it slightly easier to get into, on average, but the people who get in sure seem to have more energy on screen, as a group, than the ones who get into Amherst and Williams.  There are a lot of funny Wesleyan students.  I’m sure there are some funny Amherst and Williams students too, but let’s just say they don’t have as big of a presence on the internet.
I do like the Amherst campus, though.
That view is crazy.

That southern view over the War Memorial may well become Amherst’s most enduring landmark. Over the space of the next twenty years, they will have obliterated nearly every other structure built between the end of World War II and the early 2000s. Few colleges of its stature have had worse luck with modern architecture than Amherst:

Having had a kid who went to UMass Amherst for the linguistics program (in which they’re tops in the country), I can tell you that Amherst college offers more in the way of diverse course offerings, by virtue of being a member of the 5 colleges consortium.   For that reason, I think one gets the best of both worlds with Amherst.  Top LAC with a major flagship U a mile away, plus access to the course offerings of 3 other excellent LAC’s within a 20 min bus ride.

But, to your larger point, yes. An awful lot of Wesleyan alum make their mark in one sphere or another. Take a bow, Catie Lazarus `99, “Employee of the Month”:
