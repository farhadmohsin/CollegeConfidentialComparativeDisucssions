These are the best colleges DS got into, with no financial aid though. BTW, Penn state is Erie branch honor program, 2+2.  All opinions welcomed and valued, thanks.

2.<<<RichInPitt>>>
VT, by far.

3.<<<airway1>>>
Cost an issue? It looks like VT is leading here but would she want to start at PSU Erie for the smaller classes? Is the honor program same school as UP?

4.<<<J.L>>>
Cost is not an issue. Looking at the class sizes, it does appear Erie has smaller classes, that is why it’s still in considerations, and we have not much idea about its honor program.

5.<<<Creekland>>>
I’d go with VT.  Normally VT and Penn St are pretty darn equal in caliber (albeit a general edge toward VT in most areas of engineering), but I’d wonder how the switch from the branch campus would go.  The better students from our high school (heading toward engineering) go straight to main campus.  I’m not sure if those who start at branch campuses end up doing fine or if not.  Those I know personally (who start at branch campuses) aren’t engineering majors.  Can Erie’s branch campus let you know how many start out vs finish?  (Then allow for the fact that there will be those who start and don’t finish at the Main Campus too, of course.)

Wow, basically it is VT all the way. It’s much more loopsided than I thought. So nobody think much of Rutgers, I’m a little surprised, given Rutgers approximation to NYC and Philly.

10.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Erie is excellent for engineering but…it’s not main campus. So it’d all depend on her/your certainty wrt small classes with little weedout (thanks to honors) but at a small campus (I think it’s 4,000 students and not all live on campus) requiring the move to a larger campus after 2 years, or 4 years in the same place, with all the on campus life it entails but also the increased competition. However my gut feeling would be to go for VT, so that she can have the “full college experience”.
Do ask VT what sort of support they have for women in engineering: WISE? Living learning communities? Special adviser within engineering?

11.<<<J.L>>>
Thank you, we will do the inquiry and visit and experience it for a day or two as well.

12.<<<sevmom>>>
The living /learning community for male engineering students at Virginia Tech is called Galileo. For women, it is called Hypatia.

13.<<<Greymeer>>>
@J. L. What is the instate choice?

14.<<<spqr70nj>>>
@j. L  Sounds like you have the same decision to make as my son. Penn State admitted him 2+2 also but as OOS we’d have to be crazy to accept that cost wise. He is definitely UP material. Was also accepted to Rutgers, Buffalo, and West Virginia with significant merit.

15.<<<J.L>>>
ASU did offer pretty significant merit, however, without honor, ASU sounds too low ranking a college?

16.<<<MYOS1634>>>
It’s not really about ranking, but rather about experience: non honors classes at ASu are huge, classes that are supposed to be writing intensive or discussion based can’t be due to large class sizes… funding cuts have mostly spared Barrett students not have fallen hard upon the “regular” students. Retention is pretty good (93% of students who had an A average in high school return for sophomore year, and 81% for B average students) but still only 45% graduate in 4 years, in part because of costs and in part because it’s huge and anonymous.
That being said, Engineering is going to be tough everywhere and if it’s less expensive it’s worth considering.

17.<<<J.L>>>
45% is for the entire university, not for engineering though, and I suspect Engineering is even much lower. But I’d welcome anyone’s input if they think we should think more seriously about this option.

18.<<<sevmom>>>
Is ASU instate for you? Lowest cost? Many kids  opt for their instate engineering school or other schools that  end up being cost effective because of need based aid or merit aid . How much did you agree to pay for college?

19.<<<J.L>>>
Miami University (Oxford) gave about the same level of offer, however, that school is not known for its engineering.

20.<<<sevmom>>>
This is confusing. Earlier you said “cost is not an issue.”  Is it or isn’t it? Obviously, if cost is not a factor, Virginia Tech, for instance, would potentially be one of your better  choices.  It is hard to give good recommendations without more complete information from you.

21.<<<J.L>>>
Cost is not a determining factor, but someone asked if ASU is the lowest cost college for us, hence the comment. Yes, looks like DS is most likely heading to Virginia Tech.

22.<<<sevmom>>>
Is Rutgers instate? Not clear as you have OOS after Virginia Tech in your thread title.   If Rutgers is instate, that would definitely  be worth looking into further.  A couple  of us have asked what your instate engineering options are. Sorry if I missed your response.  I was confused because you said “cost is not an issue”, but seemed to be looking at schools with engineering  that give merit aid (ASU, Miami of Ohio, etc) . I would  probably pass on PSU  unless it was the main campus since it does not seem to be instate for you.  Good luck with the decision.

23.<<<whataboutcollege>>>
I am very curious why VT is overwhelmingly favored over Rutgers. Any concrete reason is appreciated! On paper Rutgers has lower admission rate, higher stats in student profile, and a much more convenient location.

24.<<<J.L>>>
Rutgers is OOS for us as well.

Arizona State’s low graduation rates probably relate to the fact that it is not that selective.

Some majors do have higher requirements.
However, a strong student should not be too concerned about personal risk of delayed or non graduation because many of the weaker students do not graduate or take extra semesters.  (However, extra semesters are often more common for engineering majors, regardless of college.)

26.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
One advantage that Rutgers have over VT and PSU is that (currently) no engineering majors are restricted admission for those who enter in the engineering division:
https://soe.rutgers.edu/oas/first-year-declaration
VT starts engineering students in general engineering.  Those who earn a 3.0 college GPA in the first year courses can choose any engineering major.  Others face competitive admission:
https://enge.vt.edu/content/dam/enge_vt_edu/undergraduate/coe_com.pdf
PSU does something similar, and publishes varying college GPA thresholds to enter each major:

https://advising.psu.edu/entrance-major-requirements-college-engineering

27.<<<J.L>>>
Thanks for your comments, good food for thought. However, isn’t the reason that normally people choose a more reputable school to go to is to choose your peers? Because better peers are much more likely to push one to perform to a higher standard, which I believe is exactly what my DS needs. Therefore, ASU’s graduation rate does deter us from attending.
As for the GPA requirements, VT looks easier, because 3.0 guaranteed it, while Penn State only listed the minimum GPA, What is the engineering survival rate in VT and Penn state? Anyone got data? 3.0 should be OK though, not too tough, hopefully.

http://www.gradeinflation.com/ (bottom of page) suggests that the average college GPAs at Rutgers, VT, and PSU are around 3.1 (ASU not listed).  Being in a school with mostly stronger peers may backfire if he ends up at the bottom of the grading curves and does not meet the GPA requirement for his desired major (at VT and PSU).

29.<<<J.L>>>
At least it worth a try. Worst comes to worst, I believe ASU is very easy to transfer into.

30.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Transferring to ASU engineering majors does require a college GPA higher than the minimum for the campus:
https://webapp4.asu.edu/programs/t5/programs/AreaOfInterest/08/undergrad/false (click on specific majors to see transfer GPA requirements)
Most engineering majors seem to require 2.75 or 3.00 GPA to transfer in.
So a student in the lower GPA range at VT or PSU and could not get into the desired major may have a GPA too low to transfer to an ASU engineering major.

31.<<<J.L>>>
Actually, studying your link of GPA up to 2015, Virginia Tech has higher average GPA than Penn State or Rutgers, no wonder it is one of the campuses that has the happiest students. The case for Virginia Tech is stronger and stronger.

32.<<<Creekland>>>
VT alum here - H is too - and currently owns his own engineering firm (going on 20 years).  No regrets at all with our college choice.  We loved our time there.  Every couple of years we stop by to see the changes the school has made since we were there (back in the 80s!)  It’s expanded incredibly.  We’re jealous of the students there now and all their opportunities.  We talk with current students and listen to what they are researching, etc.  These are random students we come across who offer to speak with us - not selected students from admissions or the alumni network, etc.  Yes, students are happy there.  I’ve yet to hear a single one speak negatively about the school.
We wanted our lads to go to VT, but alas they all wanted elsewhere (none headed into engineering either).  Such is life.
Why is VT ranked better than other schools (for engineering)?  My guess would be due to their multiple opportunities in all sorts of research - and these aren’t limited to grad students.  It’s just a guess.  Others might have more concrete reasons.
Engineering is a tough major, so be sure your guy knows to join study groups or similar to help him keep up.  It’s a major one can’t get behind in and expect to catch up with an all nighter before the test.  This last part is true regardless of the school chosen.

33.<<<Greymeer>>>
"However, isn’t the reason that normally people choose a more reputable school "
Splitting hairs.
By regional reputation VT and ASU are academically equivalent schools.
On the east coast, VT is not considered to be any kind of academic powerhouse. No more than ASU is one on the west coast.

34.<<<MYOS1634>>>

35.<<<J.L>>>
@Greymeer Are you sure? Everyone we talked to, ranked VT Engineering very highly. ASU is known to be the super safety school, which is not true for VT, especially OOS.

36.<<<Creekland>>>

[quote]

For engineering?  You ought to find a different crowd to consult with.  Powerhouses in engineering are often different than powerhouses for other majors.  Doing a quick google search and just looking on the search page it appears they’re ranked #13.  ASU is #38.  PSU is #24.  Individual departments have their own ranking so one should look at what they are interested in if rankings matter.  As with anything else, different schools have a more directed engineering focus.
Overall though, in engineering circles, yes, VT is considered an academic powerhouse.  H has had headhunters after him pretty much his whole engineering career and even when doing projects on other continents, his VT degree was respected (since many of those folks cared about the name on his diploma as well as projects he’d already done).

Google “super safety colleges”.

39.<<<sevmom>>>
Sorry, there is no way that Virginia Tech is a “super safety” in engineering.  VT’s fairly  high acceptance rates are misleading- lots of self selection in terms of applicants and a large class to admit every year .

40.<<<spqr70nj>>>
A lot of the college admission percentages are misleading because they don’t account specific majors that may have higher admission criteria.  It’s just a percentage of total addimision. Penn State is another one.  They’ve admitted students this current admission cycle to the main University Park campus with substantially lower stats than a lot of business and engineering pre-majors with higher stats. Instead, PSU pushed those kids off to branch campuses.  And the expection is that if you want to attend, don’t count on any aid.

Spent a few minutes looking at VT’s website about engineering and saw this statement:

[quote]
Virginia Tech produces a fifth of the nation’s professional engineers.
[/quote]

Have to admit I’m stunned.  Any idea where they got that info?  If true, I had no idea they produced so many and it could be another reason why they are considered an engineering powerhouse.  Granted, H is one of them as he’s had his PE for years, but still, one out of five from VT?  (Note if anyone missed it that this is PE  - professional engineers - not just engineering graduates.)  Still… where are the stats?  (Google has not been helpful.)
The statement comes from this page:
https://eng.vt.edu/admissions.html

44.<<<sevmom>>>
@Creekland  The statement above  does not capitalize “professional engineer” or specifically reference PE status (my husband has his PE license  as well, although did not go to Virginia Tech). The website may just be talking about engineering graduates in general?  You could reach out to the Engineering department if you want or need clarification on that. The bottom line-Virginia Tech produces tons of engineers and their graduates are sought after by many employers.

45.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
https://ncees.org/licensure/number-licensees-state/ says that there are about 820,000 licensed Professional Engineers.  Somehow, it seems doubtful that 164,000 of them are VT graduates (164,000 is about 98 years worth of VT engineering graduates, based on 1666 per year according to http://profiles.asee.org/profiles/8059/screen/21?school_name=Virginia+Polytechnic+Institute+and+State+University – and many engineering graduates outside of civil engineering do not seek PE licensing).
Now, if you are referring to all engineering graduates working in engineering jobs (whether or not with PE license), the number is even larger.

46.<<<Creekland>>>
@ucbalumnus  That is exactly the thought that came to my mind without the actual numbers.  Seems rather impossible any way one looks at it even if one assumes a reasonable number of those 820K came from abroad.  I like my alma mater and I know several successful graduates from it engineering and otherwise, but methinks that statement (whether PE or pe) is hogwash.  I’m very curious as to what they’re basing it on, but not curious enough to ask TBH.  If someone else did, I’d love to read the answer though - or see the statement taken down.  False facts is one of my pet peeves no matter who says it.

47.<<<Gudmom>>>
My daughter was accepted to Cornell, RPI, Case Western, Northeastern, Clemson, Stevens, Rutgers and Rowan in-state, all for engineering. She had a range from no aid to very good merit. We really, really struggled with the decision, but it came down to Cornell, ranked #11 for engineering, and VT, ranked #14.
Cornell was too expensive for us, and the other schools just didn’t measure up. She cried for 24 hours, then she was over it.
She is finishing up her freshman year. She made Deans list last semester (no worries about getting her first choice major) She lives in the engineering housing (Lee Hall, Hypatia  for women, Galileo for men) which has probably made a difference- everyone is taking the same classes and so they all have to study at the same times, no pressure to party when you should study.
My favorite part? Everyone seems so happy to be there. When we were wandering around campus trying to come to terms with turning down “an Ivy” , kids would literally just start talking to us. “Would your daughter like to see my dorm room? I live in Lee Hall” or telling us about their plans for graduate school, how their classes went, what they thought about work-life balance. Literally random girls we met while petting their dogs. Tons of cute dogs.
The parents we met at restaurants were nice, and many were alums. They showed us photos of their kids, they asked us to let them know what she decided. Every single person we met was so great. There were NINE rainbows on our drive home. It was just so great. It IS so great.
My friend is a CEO of a tech company in the research triangle. She says “some of the best engineers I hire are VT grads”
I’m sorry, I am a little biased, but, really, it’s the whole package. Rutgers is basically a commuter campus. I don’t know much about PSU engineering.

48.<<<Gudmom>>>
By the way, I was
looking for stats for the current freshman class and saw this:  https://vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2018/10/eng-usnews-undergrad-ranking18.html
OK, if you can’t see it it says that Virginia tech is the FIFTH LARGEST PROVIDER of engineering graduates. So that’s a pretty big misunderstanding, but that’s all it is.

49.<<<J.L>>>
@Gudmom  Thanks for sharing your story, and yes, the more we talk to others, the more we found out how VT engineering experience and brand is treasured. Looks more and more likely that DS will be joining your daughter in VT. BTW, VT engineering has advanced to #13 this year, and I do expect it to go up even further in the future.
Last but not least, do you know what is the survival rate for Engineering and how are the intern opportunities? How big are the freshmen classes that your daughter attended?

50.<<<sevmom>>>
There  is detailed info online about retention if you google it. For instance, for 2016, 88.4% remained in engineering from freshman to sophomore years , 80.7% retention into third year. There is support if needed so a motivated student should be able to get at least to the 3.0 freshman  GPA that guarantees choice of major.  My son had no problem getting well above that threshold. Most kids that stay with engineering and put in the work  are able to get their choice of major .

51.<<<airway1>>>
Isn’t at the regional campus at PSU cheaper than main campus? I thought I saw 20k for regional but not sure

52.<<<Gudmom>>>
My daughter is home for Spring break. She says her physics and chem classes were 200 people lectures, math classes 20-50 people, as are most other classes. Engineering was smaller first semester, around 30, now it’s about 50-60. They split up into working groups of 6 people in engineering. There is a one credit course you take if you are in Hypatia that’s a little GPA boost, it is mentoring and career events and 10 hours of community service which was honestly kind of fun for her at the beginning when she didn’t have a lot going on socially.
My daughters advice is that if you want better housing or a more social environment, pick O’Shaug or Peddrew-Yates. Pritchard is social but not nicer than Lee. But if you are concerned about work environment for freshman year, the engineering community helps for environmental reasons - no crowds wandering the halls when you are trying to study for a chem test - because they all have the same test. GPAs are higher for engineers in the engineering LLC.

53.<<<Gudmom>>>
My daughter says freshman internships aren’t “unheard of” but she doesn’t know anyone who has one. Most people do get them soph and jr year. A lot of recruiters come to campus.

54.<<<Gudmom>>>
Oh, therenis a VT subreddit that is really good for this kind of info, once you make a decision.
I will say one thing - thjnk about how your son will get to campus. You haven’t said what State you DO live in, but VT isn’t that easy to get to. My son is twice as far and it’s cheaper and easier to get him home from Miami. For DD, we have so far tried a plane, train, bus, and ride share. For us the bus to Allentown PA makes sense, but I still have to drive 1-1/2 hours each way to get her .

Assuming living on campus, mechanical engineering major, PSU Erie is $37,860 for out-of-state, while PSU Main is $48,268.  See https://cce.ais.psu.edu/tuition-calculator-ui/#!/ .
Yes, you can complete a bachelor’s degree in EE, IE, or ME at PSU Erie, according to http://main.abet.org/aps/AccreditedProgramsDetails.aspx?OrganizationID=55&ProgramIDs= .  However, the price is rather expensive if the intention is to transfer to PSU Main, using PSU Erie like a community college.

Tuition also increases @airway1 at PSU after a certain amount of credits are reached - going from sophomore to junior year.

59.<<<airway1>>>
Thanks for the info. My son got into UP so didn’t look into the full structure of pricing for the other campuses

60.<<<Gudmom>>>
@ucbalumnus what I mean by “Rutgers is basically a commuter campus” is that there really isn’t a campus feeling. It is several campuses spread all over New Brunswick and Piscataway, and there are so many students who live nearby that the campus empties out every weekend. They go home. I live 45 minutes away, and even the kids who do live on campus freshman year usually move back home sophomore year because there just isn’t a lot going on.
You can only tell so much by reading about it. Sometimes you have to experience it. I took classes post grad for a couple of years. Excellent instructors, well-respected program. But it could be lonely for an OOS student, and, well…go HOKIES!

61.<<<spqr70nj>>>
@Gudmom I feel the same about Rutgers. We live even closer…15 miles and if my son decides to attend, I’d want him on campus. However, my biggest fear is that it will be deserted on weekends, he won’t have that true ‘college’ experience, and as he puts it, he’ll feel like it’s an extension of high school. In two weeks we are having second looks at some other schools he had been accepted at and hope he sees the benefits of those programs as well.

62.<<<njdadjets>>>
Why in the world would you send your kid out of state and spend thousands more rather than going to Rutgers,tcnj, or  Rowan??? Because Rutgers is a commuter school? Why would that have a bearing on where to go? Wish I had that money to burn

63.<<<njdadjets>>>
I get the issues with Rutgers lousy campus and buses, but in sheer cost/value vs private or out of state public schools—TCNJ and Rowan engineering for instate students are unbeatable now. Just take a look at their student outcomes—- high retention rates after freshman year, newer state of the art facilities —- near 100% employment or grad school after graduation plus average starting salarys for each engineering discipline in the high 60k’s to over 70k for computer and electrical engineering. Contrast that with out of state public school costs or what I call the “Stevens Dilemma” where a school like Stevens gives huge scholarship discounts to freshmen who fail to pull a 3.0 and thereafter lose that mo ru.

64.<<<njdadjets>>>
Also consider the smaller pedestrian campuses of tcnj and Rowan where everything is a short walk away rather than Rutgers or PennState for instance. A smaller more manageable campus is a huge benefit to engineering students whose time is better spent studying and having some free time to relax as opposed to riding buses and essentially having to commute to class from your dorm a la Rutgers or Penn State

65.<<<spqr70nj>>>
In some cases those OOS schools are providing better scholarship money that makes Rutgers more expensive as an instate student. Rutgers didn’t give a dime of aid to us. I understand what my son means by having a feeling that Rutgers would be ‘an extension of high school’. That came from him, not me. I grew up near SUNY Stony Brook and was strongly advised by my HS guidance counselor to look at other schools outside the area upstate public and private. For me, it was the best move. Everyone is different. But when a school shows interest and is offering significant aid, how Do you not look further into it.

66.<<<Engineer80>>>
@njdadjets - From what personal experience do you claim a “Stevens dilemma”? What dilemma? Stevens does not arbitrarily withdraw scholarships. If a scholarship or financial aid offer is made contingent upon maintaining a certain minimum GPA, that will be clearly stated in the offer. I have never heard of the GPA requirements for a scholarship being changed arbitrarily after the fact of any Stevens student or graduate I know personally, nor did it happen to me when I was a student there. If you really believe Rowan and TCNJ are on the same level and attract the same calibre of students and that their outcomes are as good as Stevens (check out Payscale’s survey, which puts Stevens at 15th of 1134 US colleges and universities for starting salaries and ROI on tuition, whereas Rowan and TCNJ are somewhere in the 150s I believe), well, you are mistaken. Stevens has the highest selectivity, highest SAT scores, highest average high school GPA, and highest percentage of students in the top 10% of their high school classes of entering freshmen/women of all NJ schools with the exception of Princeton University. Students clamor to attend Stevens whereas from my vantage point I see students leaving New Jersey to go to college, despite Rowan, Rutgers, TCNJ, et al being “inexpensive” for NJ residents. If those schools are so good and such a good value, then why do so many NJ students leave the state? Stevens and Princeton are the only NJ universities that NJ students really want to attend.
In the realm of NJ public engineering schools, everyone outside of NJ has heard of Rutgers. Nobody outside of this area has heard of Rowan or TCNJ, seriously. I have had job interviews in a dozen different states. All of my interviewers knew of Stevens (and Rutgers).
Many scholarship offers at all schools have minimum GPA requirements. Donors and benefactors of scholarships frequently impose conditions that the student must meet in order to retain the scholarship, and GPA is a very common one. Those are stated in the offers. I had to maintain a specific GPA to keep my scholarship at Stevens for example, and that was clearly specified from the beginning.

[/quote]

Not sure why that would be a Stevens-specific issue.  Any scholarship at any college that requires a high college GPA to renew could have this issue.  Obviously, how big of an issue depends on the GPA.  For top-end scholarships that require a 3.0, it is likely that few students lose them (after all, they had to have been at the top-end of the entering class to get the top-end scholarships).  But if the GPA minimum is something like 3.5, that can be more of an issue, since students have to protect their GPAs like pre-meds do.

69.<<<Engineer80>>>
It isn’t an issue specific to any particular institution. As previously discussed, many scholarships (if not most) at many schools mandate that the recipient maintain a minimum GPA. Frequently, those conditions are imposed by the benefactor or funder of the scholarship. If the minimum GPA is not maintained, many will reduce or withdraw the scholarship. That is quite a common condition. The vast majority I am certain will state this or any other conditions that must be satisfied up front, and in those cases the student is made aware of his/her responsibilities up front. In my experience most schools are not in the business of “bait and switch”.

70.<<<researchingmom19>>>
@Engineer80 congrats on your engineering success. My son is considering Stevens for Bio and then plans to go to Medical school. I know their engineering program, job placement record and starting salaries are top. I’m interested in information for students’ experience in the bio/pre-med track. Thanks
