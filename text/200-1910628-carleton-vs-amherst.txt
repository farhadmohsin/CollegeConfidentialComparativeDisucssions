We’re faced with a bit of an unexpected situation.  Our son, who I had posted about before, applied to schools this year, with a focus on LACs.  He had some very good choices, and ended up selecting Carleton.  He did end up on a few waitlists, though, at some schools he really liked (Williams, Pomona, Amherst).  And yesterday he heard from one of them, Amherst, and they offered him admission.  He’s got a couple days to think it over and decide.  So, we’re looking for advise, comments that might help us pick between these two schools.
Some particular relevant topics:
He plans to study Physics (and go on to grad school).  The strength of the Physics department/program is one of the primary considerations.  My impression is that Carleton’s Physics program is stronger than Amherst’s.
The general campus atmosphere: My son prefers an open, collaborative, diverse, somewhat laid-back environment.
The kind of students who go there: To give an idea, one thing he really liked about Carleton, in a survey asking students what word they’d use to describe students there, “quirky” was the top choice (at another school, it was “hipster”, which he didn’t care for).
We often hear about the prominence of athletics at schools like Amherst (and Williams).  Just how much is this the case there, and how would it affect someone not active in athletics?  (My son played soccer in high school, also some ultimate and tennis, but he is not at a level to play on a college team.)
The study abroad program
We’re in Illinois, and one of my son’s preferences is to get out of the midwest.  (I’m from the east coast originally, and still have family there.)
Amherst’s endowment is quite a bit larger – does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools?
Financial aid: Amherst’s aid is “no loan”.  Does that mean we can’t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to?  And if we can, would it be on top of the grant they’ve already given us, or would it displace some of it?  (Their website seems to suggest the former; I plan to speak with their FA office tomorrow.)  With the loan, the FA packages are very similar.
FWIW, we’re of course not counting on any of the other waitlists coming through, but including those other schools, I’d say that my son’s liking preference is Williams &gt; Pomona &gt; Amherst &gt; Carleton; and my estimate of the quality of the Physics programs is Williams &gt; Carleton &gt; Amherst &gt; Pomona.
Interestingly, I feel that deciding between these two schools now is more difficult than the initial decision for Carleton!
Thanks!

Congratulations! Amherst will not include loans in your aid package but you can take as much as you want up to the direct loan max, to help with your family or student contribution, for example.
D is not an athlete, loves her school, had an active social life that includes athletes and musicians and artists.
The ultimate team there was the first one ever, and it is a club sport with two level teams so if he wants to play he can.
Study abroad… Main thing to know is cost/financial aid is the same on campus or away. So he can choose whatever.
D’s academic experience has not felt competitive to her at all. She makes great use of office hours, reading and quant center, and other students.
Sorry I know nothing about the physics Dept.

[/quote]

Carleton is commonly regarded as one of the more STEM-oriented LACs, while Amherst is sometimes regarded as less STEM-focused.
You can determine the percentage of STEM majors at a LAC by adding up the relevant numbers (for computer science, engineering if offered, biology, math, and physical sciences) in Section J of the Common Data Set. For these two schools, I get:
Carleton: 40.2 % STEM, 12.1 % physical sciences specifically
Amherst: 26.6 % STEM, 5.1 % physical sciences specifically
So there does appear to be more interest in STEM, and in physical sciences particularly, at Carleton. There is some suspicion that “open curriculum” schools (such as Amherst) attract a disproportionate number of science/math-phobes (because they can avoid taking any classes in these fields). In recent years, there has some concern about the aging of the Amherst science facilities, but a brand new science center is under construction, and is scheduled to open in Fall 2018.
I’m sure you can get a great undergraduate physics education at Amherst. However, it wouldn’t surprise me if there are more physics faculty and a broader variety of physics courses at Carleton. You could review the college catalogs to see. Note, however, that Amherst students also have access to the 5-College Consortium, which could increase the range of physics course options, most likely at UMass.

4.<<<ThankYouforHelp>>>
Congrats!   Carleton is a great school.  No bad choices here.  Amherst is collaborative, not competitive.  It has a lot of athletes, but it also has a lot of artsy types.   The study abroad program is excellent and easily available to all students, including those on financial aid.
Carleton is strong in physics, but Amherst is strong in physics as well (and so is Williams).   All three are among the top dozen colleges in the country in the percentage of their graduates who go on to get PhDs in physics (Pomona is not).
Amherst is the most ethnically diverse top tier LAC, with 47 percent of the student body being persons of color.  It also is the most economically diverse LAC (along with Vassar).  A full quarter of the Amherst class is on Pell Grants, which means lower income students on full rides.  Carleton has about half that.  Not sure how much those things matter to you.
In addition, be aware that Amherst is building a spectacular new science center which will open at the end of your son’s freshman year.

5.<<<SwimDad99>>>
You’ve gotten some great responses here. The fact is – there’s now way to screw this up. Both spectacular choices. Carleton definitely has its strengths and is, by reputation, probably the best LAC in the entire Midwest. Amherst is maybe the best in the country or certainly among the top two or three. Purely on reputation, I’d give Amherst a small but not insignificant edge. Also, keep in mind the Five College Consortium and those additional resources at hand with Amherst.
But if Carleton is stronger in physics, then that’s certainly reason enough to go there instead. Again, no wrong choices here.
Good luck with your tough decision.

6.<<<BobShaw>>>
@csdad2 - Congratulations to your son! My D has decided to go to Carleton (from warm California). She is also interested in STEM and we found Carleton to have one of the strongest programs, among other things. If your son’s goal is to get out of the Midwest, I think discussing your topics is a moot point. Both schools offer equally strong liberals arts education, but they are different in vibe.
Another question to ask him though: does he want to live and work on the East Coast right after graduation? If so, Amherst will have more name recognition there than Carleton for recruiting by employers who are clueless about SLACs. On the other hand, Carleton is better known in the Midwest and among friends in our community, here in California (which is the second biggest supplier of Carls after Minnesota). But in the end, both schools have strong reputations and alumni networks, and both are highly regarded by grad schools, if that is your son’s goal. And among employers who know SLACs, both will have equal standing.

[/quote]

My friends who are physics faculty at top universities (including a college roommate who is a physics professor at Stanford) seem to think Carleton has one of the strongest programs while Amherst is known more for its strength in the humanities & social sciences. This is reflected in the breakdown of students by major too. However, Amherst is an amazing school and I’m sure your son will get a great science education in either school. Incidentally, physics is one of my D’s interests. BTW, did your son get a nice letter from the Carleton physics department chair, Prof. Pattanayak? If he listed Physics as an interest on Common App, he should have.

[quote]

[/quote]

Amherst is more diverse ethnically. They have recently made a push to recruit URMs, and the very fact that the college president’s quote on diversity was a topic for the Common App writing supplement speaks volumes about their priorities.
Carleton is 60% White. However, Carleton tries hard to make their student body as diverse as possible, given that Minnesota doesn’t attract as many minority students, and they love international students. Moreover, our impression is that the students are very respectful of other cultures, open-minded about diverse ideas and customs, and welcoming of diverse students. (We are Asian American.) Diversity can also refer to interests and personalities, and Carleton is definitely diverse in that sense. My wife and daughter attended the International Festival last Saturday while visiting Carleton and saw evidence of this. Plus, they explicitly asked minority students whether they felt uncomfortable there. Except for one African American male, most said that they never felt excluded or uncomfortable. One African American male from L.A. went so far as to say that he has never worried about being profiled or harassed by cops in the Twin Cities or Northfield, which is a far cry from his lifelong experience in diverse Southern California. (St. Olaf, however, is a different story. Read the news to learn what’s happening there. But right-minded students are standing up against hate and protesting against the administration, which has apparently done nothing to combat the racist acts.)
Our takeaway from visits and conversations was that Carleton is one of the friendliest, most supportive, and most collaborative colleges out there. And while the academics are intense, they are pretty laid back, or at least they don’t overtly give off a competitive vibe. Amherst seemed more “classic New England competitive” to us, and students didn’t appear as happy on the surface, but I don’t want to generalize based on our experience at one point in time. You’ll find all kinds of students at both schools, and I’m sure your son will find a core group of friends who will make his college years a positive experience. Faculty at both schools are great.

[/quote]

PSA: Some past and present Carls are requesting that people get over the “quirky” label.  However, it is true that students at Carleton come from colorful backgrounds, which makes life more interesting. I can tell you that we found the students (and other college community members) to be the friendliest and most down-to-earth of the 30+ colleges we visited. EVERYONE would stop and talk at length about everything we wanted to know, and if they were rushing to class, they would offer to drag my daughter along with them to class, introduce her to professors, and treat her to coffee and lunch afterwards. How cool is that? This is precisely why she fell in love with that place.
Our tour guide at Amherst was friendly, but aren’t all of them expected to be? The average student we intercepted to chat seemed to be in a hurry to get away, no matter the time of day. Not a reason to judge an entire school, but we couldn’t help coming away with certain perceptions of the campus culture.

I don’t think this will be a big deal at either school. At most schools, even SLACs, athletes (and the men/women attracted to them) often form cliques. It goes hand in hand with team bonding. However, it usually doesn’t affect other students, unless they are dying to be part of who they perceive to be the “in” crowd and get rejected. And we’re not talking about giant powerhouses of NCAA Division I here.

[quote]
The study abroad program
[/quote]

We like Carleton’s specific options, but both schools will offer excellent opportunities. One difference worth noting: the Carleton trimester-based academic calendar enables a student with demanding academic requirements (for a double major, for example) to go abroad for the six-week winter break (Thanksgiving to New Year’s) or for a 10-week trimester. In the latter case, the student can still take classes in Northfield for the other two trimesters, if desired. (Or you can go abroad for half a year to a year.)

There you go. Amherst wins, if this is important to your son. For us, it was the opposite. My daughter will be experiencing something very different by going to the Midwest, which is one reason she turned down all of her California choices. I agree with your son that it is important to explore something different.

[quote]
Amherst’s endowment is quite a bit larger – does that have much of an impact on differences between the schools?
[/quote]

Not that I noticed, but there may some advantages. Amherst has a slightly better student:faculty ratio. My impression is that Amherst provides slightly better financial aid, but each person’s experience may be different. On the other hand, Amherst has a higher sticker price, and Carleton spends more on R&D (can’t find my source, but I saw the figures somewhere). So who knows?

[quote]
Financial aid: Amherst’s aid is “no loan”. Does that mean we can’t do a loan (i.e., the Federal Direct Stafford loan) even if we want to?

[/quote]

You can always borrow a Parent Plus loan up to the expected family contribution. It will not replace any grants or scholarships. Eligibility for Federal Stafford loans, subsidized or unsubsidized, should be stated on the financial aid offer.
Good luck! As others will tell you, your son can’t go wrong with either choice. Great schools.

So there do appear to be significantly more physics majors at Carleton. It would not be surprising if the physics resources at Carleton (faculty, labs, class options, etc) were more extensive, given this disparity.

9.<<<BobShaw>>>
Students at Carleton dressed up the Goodsell Observatory as R2D2. Not a reason to choose Carleton, but I think that’s pretty cool.

10.<<<juillet>>>
^I would not use the raw numbers, or even proportions, of science majors at a school to evaluate the quality of that college’s programs in science. Quality is far more reliant on the professors and the resources offered at the college. One could also argue that open-curriculum schools attract a lot of STEM students who want to avoid taking humanities classes, and indeed, I have heard many STEM students make that claim. So I’d avoid stereotyping and go straight for the facts.
Let’s also remember that undergraduate students go to get a well-rounded undergraduate education, not specifically to study one thing like a graduate program. It’s important to go to a college with a solid department in the area of interest (particularly if there is interest in doing research), but either Carleton or Amherst will offer that. You could literally flip a coin and be fine. You don’t have to go to the best tippy-top school in a specific discipline to get into a PhD program in that area. What you need is a good solid department and at least one professor who is willing to mentor and shepherd you through for research and grad school. I’m confident you could get that at either college.
A quick look at the departmental websites show that their physics faculty is about the same size - if I counted correctly, excluding visiting and emeriti professors there are 9 full-time, tenure or tenure-track faculty at Carleton and 8 at Amherst. Amherst’s are, on average, more established in their careers (they are more heavily populated with full professors, who have typically been teaching 12-15+ years), but not by a whole lot - Carleton has one or two more assistant professors, it seems. The faculty at both Amherst and Carleton got their PhDs from physics departments of roughly equivalent quality, on average. A few more of Carleton’s faculty went to higher-ranked programs. Both have solid representation in astronomy and astrophysics, from browsing the catalogs. Amherst may benefit from a close connection with UMass, which has a mid-ranked physics doctoral program.
I don’t know anything about physical facilities but those can offer a clue to the level of investment (and anticipated enrollments) a college has in particular subject areas.
I will say, though, that Carleton is a top 10 producer of PhDs more generally and a top 5 producer of PhDs in the physical sciences. Amherst is in the top 30 for science and engineering PhDs overall. That could be due to a lot of different factors, but interest and investment in the sciences might be contributing factors there too. (Pomona is in the top 15 and Williams is in the top 20. This data is from the Survey of Earned Doctorates conducted by the National Science Foundation.)

12.<<<bucketDad>>>
I’m an Amherst grad with a Physics PhD.  I went to grad school with a guy from Carleton.  I think either school will prepare you for pursuing a doctorate.  I’d consider the differences in the departments to be a wash.  If you are going to a LAC it’s because to want to study physics and Russian Lit, or philosophy, or whatever the best professors on campus are teaching. Consider broadening your comparison.

13.<<<BobShaw>>>
@juillet and @bucketDad make a good point: you go to a liberal arts school for a well-rounded education, so simply comparing physics departments is selling yourself short. Besides, who knows what your son will become interested in once he starts college? In this comparison, I think the academics are generally comparable. However, your son may prefer the open curriculum of Amherst to the breadth requirements of Carleton (or vice versa). I would caution you on comparing specific professors. You’ll find great professors at both schools.
Then there is the question of three classes per trimester (Carleton) vs. four classes per semester (Amherst). This can make a huge difference, depending on your son’s learning style. As an example, since my firstborn is a champion of procrastination and last-minute cramming, like her father, the trimester system is excellent. She is used to the fast pace given her background in taking classes at the community college (quarter system), and the ten-week schedule will give her no time to slack off. On the other hand, a friend of ours with a chemistry degree from Berkeley looked at the syllabus of the intro chemistry class and said, “Whoa. That’s a lot to absorb in such a short period of time.” The semester system gives you more time to let concepts sink in. What does your son prefer? Is he disciplined about staying on top of his work and pacing himself?
Regarding @juillet 's point about facilities, I can tell you firsthand that Carleton’s science facilities are better than Amherst’s, and further improvements are in the works. Then again, someone mentioned that Amherst also has improvement projects planned, so during your son’s time in college, this may become a wash.

14.<<<momcinco>>>
You are getting some great input here, OP. Please let us know what your family decides.

15.<<<bucketDad>>>
I came out of Amherst, got my PhD in Physics, and it led me to a successful STEM career.  When I look back at Amherst, the STEM classes launched my career path…but if I had to list the 10 most memorable classes/professors I encountered while I was there…7-8 would be non-STEM.  The open curriculum allowed me to follow my career interests while taking advantage of the greatest resource the school has to offer…its teachers.
Last August I spoke with a Physics prof at Amherst.  He was already making preparations to move his lab to the new science building.  Very excited about it.  If your son chooses Amherst, those facilities will come online right when he would need them.

16.<<<57special>>>
Carleton would be the most laid back. Minnesota nice is a thing there. If your child wants to get out of the Midwest, then the question is kind of answered, though, no? Hard to get more Midwestern than Northfield, MN.

The community of fellow physics students (and of STEM students generally) is going to be significantly larger at Carleton than at Amherst. In the Class of 2016, for example, a Carleton physics major had 25 other physics students in his or her class, while an Amherst physics major had 6. This seems like it would be a noticeable difference.
A larger physics community doesn’t automatically make Carleton a better choice – the whole point of LACs, after all, is that smaller can be better. However, it is a difference that will affect the undergraduate experience of a physics major, and which is therefore worthy of consideration.

That would be my kid who stated exactly that reason for preferring an open curriculum.  But lo and behold, she’s taken a writing class and a couple of humanities courses and in one case encountered a favorite professor. She is a STEM major in a small department and so far that means she gets a lot of attention from the dept chair and her professors, help with planning summer research, study abroad plus research connections, and rec letters.
I don’t have much to add to the very helpful posts here so far, but will point to a couple of resources you may find helpful.
The science center is under construction and is supposed to open fall '18. There are details here: https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/future/greenway-campus/science-center
Amherst hosts a SURF program in the following areas (currently, they change year to year): https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/support/funding/students/amherst-student-research-funding-opportunities/summer-research-opportunities-at-amherst/2017-surf-research-areas - it’s paid and comes with housing. They will also provide funding for unpaid internships and research elsewhere.
My D also wanted to get out of the midwest, and we also have family in the NE, SO I get where your S is coming from.
Carleton sounds like an amazing place too, I can’t see you going wrong here.

19.<<<OHMomof2>>>
Since you mentioned study abroad and financial aid, I’ll add this very detailed explanation describing how program expenses as well as airfare, etc are covered: https://www.amherst.edu/offices/financialaid/studyabroad_aid

20.<<<57special>>>
S1, a HS junior, has interest in both those schools if he decides to go the LAC route. Completely different reasons than the OP’s. Aunt, Uncles and cousins live in Amherst, and he has interest in working near  the economic centers of Boston, Washington, NYC, Philly, etc. when he graduates. Seems Amherst would be better for that.
He had moderate interest in Carleton till he visited. He was kind of knocked out by most of it. Hey, I wanted to go there! I think it’s setting in rural MN is kind of a blessing. If it was in a more populated/warmer region I believe it would be overrun with applicants. Course, then the tenor of the school would probably change, and students and staff would start strutting around with their noses in the air.
I don’t think either school is a sports powerhouse, but would guess that Amherst is more accomplished in that area.
Excuse the random musings.
Carleton was actually the more expensive of the two when I ran the NPC's for our middle class income bracket, but it wasn't a large difference.

[/quote]

You’re giving the open curriculum too much credit here.
Don’t get me wrong – it’s great that a STEM major takes lots of cool non-STEM classes. This is, in fact, the LAC ideal. But the exact same thing would have been possible at a LAC with distribution requirements, e.g. Carleton or Williams or Swarthmore. The point of distribution requirements is simply to guarantee that a STEM major takes non-STEM classes.
So you could have been a STEM major and taken lots of cool non-STEM courses at any of these schools. The only difference is that Amherst allowed you to take cool non-STEM courses on a voluntary basis, while at the other schools, taking cool non-STEM courses would have been required. But the net result (for you) would have been exactly the same.
If you plan to explore a wide variety of disciplines during your LAC career, then it makes no difference whether you pick a school with an open curriculum or one with distribution requirements. If there are distribution requirements, you will fulfill them without even trying.
The open curriculum matters for people who want to limit their explorations. For example, if you were a STEM major and you wanted to avoid taking non-STEM courses, then it would make a big difference if you enrolled at Amherst vs. the other schools.

22.<<<csdad2>>>
Thanks for the responses everyone!
A few followup points:
Regarding my son wanting to leave the midwest (or even the strength of the Physics program), that’s just a factor, not an absolute.  Carleton/Minnesota, while still the midwest, does provide some differences from where we are, e.g., in terms of culture/geography/recreation/climate.  Carleton also pulls in a fair proportion of students from other parts of the country (e.g., the coasts).  And before he heard from Amherst, my son did favor it over some other east coast schools.
As to what he might do after school, he is interested in doing something research-related, perhaps space-related.  I’m not sure either location provides a significant advantage in this regard, especially since grad school is likely to happen in the interim.  And of course, this all could change during undergrad.
He is interested in doing research, both during the school year and during summers.  Perhaps I should’ve mentioned this, although I don’t know how much of a difference this will make, it does seem like both schools present good opportunities for this.
He is interested in being exposed to a broad variety of courses and fields, although not necessarily to the point of double-majoring.  He has been open to schools with a core curriculum or a more open curriculum, so I don’t think this is a major factor (especially between two schools like this).
He does play the viola quite well and is interested in continuing that, say participating in an orchestra.  But again, not to the level, say, of double-majoring or minoring in Music.  This kind of opportunity seemed present at most of the schools we looked at, so I didn’t feel the need to mention it.
We did visit Amherst a few months back, and did hear about and see the construction of the new science building.  But we didn’t see images/plans for the entire facility, so thanks for those links @ThankYouforHelp and @OHMomof2.  It looks like it will be a great addition to campus.
Another point I should perhaps mention: He has work-study as part of his FA package.  At Carleton, they find the position for you, whereas at most other schools the student is on their own to find a position.  Anyone know how this works at Amherst?  Oh, I just searched, and it looks like it’s up to the student.  But does anyone know how difficult it is to find a position?  At some schools I gather there are fewer positions than students.
Apologies for use of the term “quirky” :-).  I realize it is overused, especially in this context.  But it is concise, and does capture some important, relevant aspects.
Anyway, in some areas, it seems like Carleton is the clear winner, in others, Amherst.  Guess that’s what’s making this decision harder!

I’m sure that this is true. However, I also think that there are significantly more “science-phobes” and “math-phobes” out there than “social science-phobes” or “humanities-phobes”.
Amherst’s own data bear this out. The following numbers are from the Amherst Class of 2011, and were compiled for a 2013 accreditation review. For comparison, let’s use “3+ classes per academic division” as a benchmark, because it is a common LAC distribution requirement (as at, for example, Williams):
Humanities Division: 8% did not meet the benchmark (i.e. took fewer than 3 classes in this division). 1% took zero classes.
Social & Behavioral Sciences Division: 10% did not meet the benchmark. 2% took zero classes.
Science & Math: 43% did not meet the benchmark. 14% took zero classes.
It’s hard to escape the conclusion that many Amherst students use the open curriculum as a way to avoid science and math. Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many.
Another way to look at it: 92% of the Amherst Class of 2011 would have satisfied commonly used distribution requirements for humanities, and 91% would have done so in social sciences. But only 57% would have done so in science and math.
https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/AC_NEASC_5_Year_Report_2013_0.pdf
(Table: Class of 2011 Courses Attempted by Division, on p. 52).

@corbett  “It’s hard to escape the conclusion that many Amherst students use the open curriculum as a way to avoid science and math. Yes, some avoid humanities or social sciences, but not nearly as many.”
That may be true.  It doesn’t change the fact that the students at Amherst who DO choose to do science and math fare very well and have excellent opportunities and college support for further academic study like PhDs, for medical school and other professional schools, and for recruiting to businesses.   Forbes just ranked Amherst No. 1 in the nation on its list of Private Colleges Worth Every Penny.

Again, I want to emphasize that Carleton is also an excellent school and would be a great option.

This is not, by the way, an argument for dropping the open curriculum at Amherst (or any other school). On the contrary, it’s great that there are a variety of different LACs with different curricular options.
I do think, though, that the open curriculum has certain consequences that are not widely appreciated. Ironically, it may lead to a curriculum that is actually narrow and “closed” by traditional LAC standards. So while I am not arguing for change to the open curriculum, I am arguing for greater “openness” about it.

26.<<<MatzoBall>>>
You can’t go wrong with either choice, but the schools have such different vibes that I don’t think the same kids would generally be equally drawn to both.

Agree with @MatzoBall - the vibes of the campuses and student bodies are very different. My daughter looked at Carleton and most of the NESCAC schools. She really liked several of the NESCAC schools but fell in love with Carleton and was admitted ED. Had that not worked out, she would have applied to Middlebury, Bowdoin and perhaps a few other schools in the northeast, but she had no intention of applying to Amherst.

28.<<<Midwestmomofboys>>>
Just another parent chiming in – we know a bunch of kids very well who are at both Amherst and Carleton.  All love their experience, all are nice, good kids, intellectually motivated. The kind of young person you would love your own child to be romantically involved with.
If my children were ever to have been so fortunate as to have this choice, I would have suggested focusing on the structural differences. Trimester at Carleton and semester at Amherst; distribution requirements at Carleton vs. open curriculum at Amherst.  Throw in that Amherst’s strategies for enhancing diversity are very successful as it is one of the most diverse LACs around.
Emotionally, how did kid react when heard about Amherst?  Excited?  Ho hum?  There is the old “coin toss and see how you react when one school wins”  – excited or dismayed?
There is no wrong answer here, just two great, slightly different choices.

29.<<<TheGreyKing>>>
Congratulations to your son on two great choices!

According to those lists, Carleton is #7 for sending students on to PhD programs in Physics.  Amherst appears on other lists, but not the physics list.  That’s one data point, if you are looking at numeric data, but you also got a great anecdote from a poster here who majored in physics at Amherst, so individual experiences may vary.
As long as both physics programs look like they can match his needs and interests, he might weigh environmental factors of the school more heavily.
Carleton has St. Olaf nearby, but Amherst shares a consortium with Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Hampshire, and U Mass Amherst. That increases the breadth of courses available to you. And that also means there are a lot of women around!
The open curriculum does not mean just that you can avoid subjects. It means that everyone in every class is there because they are truly interested in the subject. That has to influence class discussions.
Amherst has seemingly limitless resources. Our tour guide said he was blown away by how much they can do for their students. He told us about how you can borrow a car and go to Boston or the White Mountains in NH or something, and Amherst even will reimburse the students for the gas.
As far as the athletic thing goes: as you pointed out, people say that about Williams too. I never played a sport at Williams. I never even went to a game a game at Williams. I am the least athletic person ever. And I was very happy socially and never felt excluded from anything in any way. You find like-minded friends wherever you go, I think. And Williams at least had a very friendly culture where people interacted across groups, maybe because of the freshman entry system mixing up everyone from the start. Our tour guide at Amherst this year wasn’t an athlete, either, and he was African American, and a math/philosophy double major, and he was very happy at Amherst.
I know Amherst better than Carleton, as someone who visited Amherst three times before picking Williams, my husband applied there too, and we have visited it recently with my son. None of us had any interest in leaving the northeast, so we did not visit Carleton, but it does sound awesome in college guides and on this site.
Good luck! Either choice will be a fantastic opportunity!

30.<<<MinnesotaDadof3>>>
I am in full agreement with both @CodyChesnutt and @MatzoBall, in that we found it impossible to love both Amherst and Carleton. We ended our campus visit to Amherst with plans to never look back, so submitting an application to Amherst was never a consideration. Our daughter is a happy freshman at Carleton (prospective Bio major) who applied only RD to all her college choices.
Your son either does not have a good enough of a feel for both of the colleges or else he is over intellectualizing the decision process, in my view. His gut feeling (once he is fully informed) should be his guide.

31.<<<prezbucky>>>
At this level, forget about everything but fit and cost.

More support for comments by codychesnutt, matzoball, and Minnesotadadof3.
There’s little confusing these two schools’ over-riding atmospheres. At the risk of stereotyping, Amherst is measurably more east coast pre-professional, Carleton measurably more intellectually individualistic.
The Goodsell Observatory prank referenced earlier (http://www.citypages.com/news/carleton-students-love-r2-d2-so-much-they-turn-a-building-into-the-droid-6539523) is pure Carleton, rinse and repeat, not likely to be mistaken by anyone who knows these schools as a way to spend a night in Amherst.
These difference are neither good nor bad, just differences. I’ll support the call for the OPs son to search his heart as well as his mind in determining where he’d most feel at home these coming four years.

33.<<<CoyoteMom>>>
Just wanted to post that Carleton also had current plans to renovate their science buildings and build a new addition, scheduled for completion within 1-2 years:
https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/facilities/projects/science/
My son and I just finished up an accepted students visit at Carleton; I loved the general “buzz” of intellectual conversation I heard everywhere on campus, the unpretentious friendly atmosphere, and the study abroad programs which include about 18 to choose from per year run by a Carleton professor (either for one of the 10-week terms where you can take 3 Carleton classes or for a short time during the long 6-week winter break and connected to a class before and after said break. Seriously, there are 24 Carl’s in Rome with two History professors right now, taking their full load  of 3 classes: 1 on ancient Rome, can’t remember the second - maybe Renaissance time period?, and 3 was some sort of writing focus).   If going with a professor and 24 Carl’s isn’t your idea of adventure, there were literally dozens more individual program opportunities to choose from for study abroad.
We never considered Amherst/Williams/Swat, though we did visit and son thought Haverford was OK, but not really his crowd.  

I second/third the posters who have said you can't go wrong with these two choices.  Relax, and let your son pick the school that feels right for him today!  


34.<<<BobShaw>>>
@csdad2 - Re-read this thread and you may find some interesting patterns. It’s a given that while some of us have tried to objectively compare the two colleges, we all have our biases. However, any commonalities you find among people who favor one school over the other are telling. For example, when I read the comments from current or incoming Carleton parents, I am detecting certain themes that resonate with me. It’s no coincidence that I too am an incoming Carleton parent. Ask your son which themes resonate with him. That may help decide fit since you don’t have the luxury of visiting both schools again.

35.<<<Chembiodad>>>
Just read through the thread and was surprised at the references to “we finished an accepted students day” or “incoming Carleton parent”. I thought our job was to help them develop their list based on their criteria and our budget, and then let them pick the school that is right for them. Given that both of these schools are great, as are all of the top-15, I can’t imagine there is a wrong choice unless it’s not his. A happy kid at the #8, #10, or #12 ranked school is going to end up in a better place than an unhappy one at #2 - JMHO.
My DD picked #12 Hamilton over # 7 Carleton because it was right for her - last I checked the Hamilton graduates are doing well as the Netflix Co-founder and the current Goldman Sachs Co-COO are graduates.

36.<<<Youdon_tsay>>>
Hey, OP. Former Carl parent here. A few thoughts …
Work study … You indicated that they find jobs for the kids. I don’t remember that being the case for ds, especially after his first year. As a freshman, he worked in the dining hall, but I think that’s because he wasn’t aggressive in finding his own gig. Subsequent years, he found jobs that were more suited to his interests, though I will say that he loved even working in the dining hall. lol One thing I loved is how kids get paid. They can either take all the money, have their whole check credited to their student account or split it 50-50. I assumed every school did this, but that wasn’t the case at ds2’s university; as a result, I think the cash got squandered. Not so for ds1 – he had all his check rolled over into his account and was such a diligent worker that he got a fat refund when he graduated!
He did study abroad junior year in a non-Carleton program. In addition to the Carleton-led options, there are scores of other options thanks to the consortiums to which Carleton belongs. Every year, there’s a big study-abroad fair where kids can check out their choices, and that’s how ds found his program –  a semester in New Zealand. He absolutely loved it, including meeting kids from other colleges. Every year on his birthday, the first person on FB to post a msg is his host mom from Auckland. It’s so fun to get that yearly reminder of his wonderful time there. The FA office was wonderful. Everything went really smoothly. He handled the whole thing, and it just couldn’t have gone better.
About ultimate … well, it’s a thing at Carleton. If he doesn’t want to play super-competitively, there’s the Hot Karls, the developmental team. And, of course, the DIII team and the DI team. Just knowing that he played ultimate in HS makes me think that he belongs at Carleton!  Yes, Amherst has a team, too. But I’m unabashedly biased.

37.<<<Pasadenadad>>>
As everyone says, can’t go wrong with either. So pick the one with the colors you like better. Because you’ll have to wear that logo merchandise for the rest of your life, while college is only four years.

38.<<<2mrmagoo>>>
Yet another ‘he can’t go wrong’.  One additional consideration that was a factor for my son in his choice of where to apply ED (Carleton was in his final 4) was the trimester vs. semester.
DS is at Haverford and the schools have a very similar student personality in my estimation.  I believe these tend to be overlap schools for applicants. This one may just be a gut decision regarding where he feels he would fit in best.
It’s a good dilemma to have! Great schools!

39.<<<AsleepAtTheWheel>>>
Great thread.  I have a son at Amherst and a son at Emory.  Both had that epiphany moment, of “this is where I should be.”  That epiphany doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the right choice, but it has worked out well for both of them.  Their epiphany was based more than anything on the other kids that were there, i.e., that they felt that they’d find “their people” at the school.
I’m in the camp that your son can’t/shouldn’t try to differentiate the schools based on academics, in that there’s no way that he’d exhaust the academic resources at either of these fine schools.  And either school will serve him well as a launchpad to whatever comes next.  I think he’s best served by looking at the gestalt of each school, and deciding where he thinks he’d more easily fit.
And of course, you MUST let us all know the decision.

On the trimester thing …
I remember when ds1 was looking at Carleton that there seemed to be a feeling that trimesters were bad. It wasn’t enough to dissuade him, but I remember talking about it. For me, it ended up being fantastic in ways I wouldn’t have imagined.
When the kids come home early Thanksgiving week, they are home until January. This meant a couple of things …
One, there was no expensive, extra trip home two holidays in a row. You never know what the weather will be like in MN in November. We never had to worry whether those pricey tickets we bought were going to get eaten because he couldn’t get out or back due to weather or that the trip was severely shortened because of delays and such. When he got home for turkey, he was home past New Year’s. Ds2, who is at a faraway school on the semester system, has never come for Thanksgiving.
Two, that long break was so welcome. His first two years, he worked for his summer employer. They were thrilled to have him filling 25 hours/week during the busy holiday season. And he loved the extra money.  The third year he got home the week before Christmas because he was abroad. The fourth year he used that extra time to study for the GRE and took it the week before he flew back.
Three, people seemed to think that doing study abroad would be difficult because of the trimesters. Well, if you are doing a Carleton program that’s obviously not an issue. And kids, such as my ds, who do a non-Carleton program, just did it in the fall, when it’s an even trade (one trimester/one semester). And, they miss some of that cold weather by not going to campus until spring. Well, “spring.”   

41.<<<57special>>>
S1 also liked the Trimester system once he thought about it. He didn’t like the mandatory foreign language requirement, though. Don’t know if Amherst has that.

42.<<<BobShaw>>>
Amherst’s open curriculum, by definition, does not have such a requirement.
There are ways to get out of the foreign language requirement at Carleton:
https://apps.carleton.edu/handbook/academics/?policy_id=21481
[Start - defense of foreign language requirement]
That said, my personal opinion is that every American kid SHOULD be required to develop a minimum level of fluency in a second language, whether they like it or not (and I know many college students complain about the requirement). Many top LACs, most Ivy League colleges, and Stanford agree.
[End - defense of foreign language requirement]

43.<<<OHMomof2>>>
I agree @bobshaw. Though the quickest way to do it is to spend time studying it…abroad. IMO.

44.<<<csdad2>>>
Thanks for the comments everyone!  They were very helpful.  A lot to think about, some things favoring one school, some the other.  In a way, I’m glad it was my son making the decision and not me.
We found @Pasadenadad’s comment very thought-provoking.  I mean, we’re in Illinois, how can we go with a school with Michigan colors!
Anyway, I’d say that overall my son just felt that he’d be more comfortable at Amherst, that it was more the kind of place he wanted to be at.  So Amherst it is.
So we’re all set now … unless we get a call from Williams this week …

45.<<<OHMomof2>>>
Congratulations csdad2 - and as you will soon find, that Williams joke isn’t funny 

46.<<<BobShaw>>>
Congratulations to your son! Glad to hear he knows where he’ll be more comfortable and selected accordingly. And he gets to experience New England.

47.<<<ThankYouforHelp>>>
Williams?   Pffffttt…   You have Amherst.  Why would you give that up for 4 years in the sticks?    

48.<<<CodyChesnutt>>>
^ My theory?  USNWR has Williams #1 and Amherst #2.  College by numbers… 8-|

49.<<<SwimDad99>>>
Or maybe the OP just prefers Williams? It happens, you know.

50.<<<ThankYouforHelp>>>
People who think I was serious don’t understand the friendly but deep rivalry between Amherst and Williams.   I have nothing but respect for Williams.

51.<<<csdad2>>>
Everybody’s using smileys :-).
I will say that my son is likely aware of the rankings … but then I can’t really disagree with his decisions or preferences, or the reasoning behind them.
And we are aware of the rivalry between Amherst and Williams.  It is basically that he (and in fact, we) has a preference for Williams.  It has most of the advantages that Amherst has, plus it’s clearly better in Physics (and Math).  And we really did like the location – it felt like a Swiss mountain town.  (It is behind Amherst in a few ways, like an even greater emphasis on sports and less diversity.)
But now I’ve probably jinxed things sufficiently that we won’t have to worry about this …
