I'm a high school senior living in Minnesota. I am interested in health sciences/medicine. Initially I thought I wanted to be a Bio-Medical Engineer, however I'm not entirely sure the technical side of the field fits me as well as I had originally thought. Regardless of the school/major, I plan on pursuing medical school.

2.<<<coolguy40>>>
That's a huge no-brainer. Take the scholarship. Not sure? Substitute the word "college" for "new car." Which one would you take? A 60k BMW at 5% interest you can't really afford anyway, or a new Honda Accord for free? You're going to be better off financially taking the free car. Now, you mentioned medical school. That's going to be a lot of money in loans, and you'll have a major advantage going into med school debt free.

3.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
If you are definitely going to med school (and can get in), I'd advise UW-Madison.

Otherwise, how much debt would you have to take on for Yale? How much can parents afford to pay?

4.<<<BKSquared>>>
Actually the true financial comparison is ($0, assuming full ride means everything is covered) vs. about $280k (Yale full pay plus expenses). If full ride means just tuition is covered, instead of $0, it is everything else you would need/expect to pay over 4 years. Even if the debt at the end of 4 years is only $60k, the fact is there was another roughly $220k (or whatever the final differential is vs Madison) spent that could have been saved. If you are definite about med school, it looks like a pretty easy decision unless money is really no issue for your family.

5.<<<frozencustard>>>
Only $15K debt per year to go to Yale? Wow!!!!! You should be jumping all over that.

Go to Yale and don't look back.

6.<<<DecisionHelp>>>
So to clarify, the 60k in debt would be something I take on for myself. The rest of bill would have to be footed by my family, which would still be a challenge for us to handle but somewhat doable.

7.<<<jzducol>>>
Yale has an average GPA of 3.7 vs Madison's 3.3. If you apply to med school with a choice of Yale 3.7 vs Madison 3.3, you would be glad to pay $60k to gain an advantage.

8.<<<jzducol>>>
[quote]So to clarify, the 60k in debt would be something I take on for myself. The rest of bill would have to be footed by my family, which would still be a challenge for us to handle but somewhat doable.[/quote]
So, what is the total difference?

9.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@jdzucol: Except that that analysis is faulty as we can reasonable assume that the average student at UW-Madison is not at the level of the average student at Yale.

The question is whether a student who can get in to Yale would pull the same or better/worse GPA at UW-Madison, and it not at all clear that they would get a lower GPA at UW-Madison. If you argue that they'd pull a lower GPA, you'd be making the argument that UW-Madison is more rigorous than Yale.

10.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
IMO, other than for finance/consulting, it would be really difficult to justify spending so much more for Yale than UW-Madison on purely ROI terms. And even then, it would be difficult to justify as even 2 years of an elite MBA would cost much less than 4 years of Yale.

11.<<<BKSquared>>>
OP, what will be the net cost for Madison (all in, tuition, room and board, fees, travel, books, other expenses, less grants/scholarships -- for these purposes financial aid in the form of loans should not be a credit) vs. Yale using the same metrics so we can do a true apples to apples financial comparison? Also is the Madison scholarship for all 4 years and contingent on maintaining some minimum gpa. Finally if you lose the scholarship, what will be the new net cost (are you in state, OOS)?

12.<<<DecisionHelp>>>
The net cost of Madison for four years would be no more than 5,000 a year. All tuition is covered, all that would need to be payed is housing + gas money back to Minnesota. Minnesotans also gain reciprocity with Wisconsin, so if the scholarship is lost It would be roughly 30,000 a year. Yale would be around 70,000 a year with tuition, housing, and flights back to MN. No doubt that Madison is the smart play on the numbers side.

13.<<<ab2002>>>
You are going to medical school, so Madison would be a no-brainer. You can always apply to Yale for medical school, as long as you keep your GPA up in undergrad.

14.<<<NoKillli>>>
@PurpleTitan

The question to me is how big is the overlap between the top UW students and the middle to top Yale students. That is a general question I have for state flagships and the top 15.

UW 75% 1450 SAT
Yale 75% 1600
Yale 25% 1420

Without more data points, it is hard to tell exactly, but you could interpolate and get close. I envision two overlapping bell curves with Yale's shifted and elongated to the right.

Anecdotally:
The only kid who got into Yale from our HS in the past 7 years had a 1420 (Naviance makes it easy to figure this out). He had a 4.0 as do pretty much the top 10% of the class (my kid said he was very smart). FWIW, he had the "mother of all" non-sports ECs for Yale. His EC was off the charts for a high school kid. I have no doubt he could throw down a big GPA in either place.

15.<<<tk21769>>>
You're aware of the annual limits on federal student loans, right?
<url>https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized</url>

Maybe your parents are willing to co-sign for private loans that exceed those limits. Even so, I'd suggest that the limits are there for a reason. Somebody's analysis leads to the conclusion that > $31K is not advisable. FWIW, Yale's average debt at graduation is about $14K (for students who have any loans, that is, not for all students). So, by both those standards, $60K is a lot (especially if you're serious about med school, and if $60K represents only part of a much bigger cost difference).

16.<<<rosered55>>>
I think you should go to Madison. But ... room and board will be closer to $10,000 than $5,000 (unless you're planning to not eat, which I don't recommend).

17.<<<oldfort>>>
Yale. I don't even want to bother with additional words.

18.<<<MinnesotaDadof3>>>
The pull of Yale's prestige would be difficult for many to fight against, so you and your family will have to make a choice. I do know you can -- and will -- get a great education at UW-Madison. We have a son who opted for Madison, loves it and just three days ago was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa there as a junior. He studies hard, has ECs, and I'm sure you will, too, and that you would not lose your scholarship.

It's good to learn that Madison now offers scholarships to out-of-state and Minn. reciprocity students, unlike three years ago. The monetary resources that you would save by enrolling at Madison would be available for medical school. It would be a treat to enter residency without $300,000+ of med school debt.

BTW -- let us know in two weeks what choice you make. You'll likely change your mind twice a day until you feel good about a decision.

19.<<<MadcityParent>>>
Madison. If med school is a serious consideration, you will want to minimize debt.

20.<<<DecisionHelp>>>
I actually have to make a decision by this Friday due to the conditions of the scholarship. I have no doubt that the next two days will be full of ambivalence!

21.<<<prezbucky>>>
@PurpleTitan

Regarding rigor, I did not attend Yale, so I cannot speak for it. But I was a Journalism major at UW, and I thought it was hard. I wrote a whole mess of research papers (one 12-pager was written twice, when my floppy disk somehow didn't save it properly the first time... oh joy), about two-thirds of my non-STEM exams were essay- or case-based and the multiple choice exams were A-J/K/L rather than A-D. Granted, I had an active social life, and I could have worked harder, but I had a hard time earning A's there. UW does not seem interested in handing out A's that aren't earned. I was a 3.8, single-sitting uncoached 30 kid from northern Wisconsin, and for the first time in my life, I couldn't coast. A lot of kids simply can't handle the academics or the academics/social balance, but it isn't a cakewalk for the other 67ish% who can.

That said, kids can become distracted at Yale too, and I would imagine if one were to not give great effort, it would show in his or her GPA. Yale is a proud school -- they care about their grad rate, but they also care about their academic rep.

I have a dog in this race, but if everything else were even or nearly so, I would suggest Yale. But it's not -- it's six-figures not, and this kid wants to go to med school.

OP, UW is a blast. Paying $5k per annum vs. $70k at Yale makes it, to me, the better choice given your circumstances.

22.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
More like a quarter of a million total. You can do a lot with that money.

23.<<<WISdad23>>>
I sometimes wonder about how people make personal finance decisions. Perhaps your parents are willing to part with your future inheritance in order for you to go to Yale and that is admirable. But the money is all in the same pool Assuming that you + parents are out zero for UW Madison x 4 years vs being out $240,000 for going to Yale for 4 years, in what way is that affordable?

To put it in perspective, if you were to invest that amount of money (the 240K) at age 22 and earn 7% per year on average until you retire at age 65 you would be ahead $4.4 million! You are not likely going into medicine for the money, but money does matter. If you are a doctor and figuring out any job, any year, any change, etc. it will always matter to you.

Obviously, Yale is Yale. And $4.4 million in retirement is $4.4 million. That is more than most doctors have in savings when funding their own retirements after a career of work. If you have children or spouse for whom you want to provide in the future, the decision is simple. UW is a good school and offers a lot of opportunities. Wisconsin also has two medical schools in state.

24.<<<oldfort>>>
Every year we have similar discussion. Yale's COA is 280K now. The answer is different for every family, there is no clear answer. My short answer above is based on what OP posted - parents could afford to pay their share and OP would come out with 60K loans. I know so many students who have changed their mind about medical school.
My daughter was offered a full tuition at a 2nd tier LAC. I also had a hard time to walk away from 40K/yr back then, but It was my daughter who said she would be willing to borrow 10k/yr from me to go to an Ivy. I also thought about what we could do with 200K. I decided the ROI on my D could be much higher than if I've put it in any other investment.
There is a discussion on the Parent Forum about if it matters what school your kid goes to, maybe it is worth a read. From my personal experience, it does matter and it matters more than just the first job. My older daughter is making top 1% salary at an age of 27 and my younger daughter is finishing up a 2 year internship where they only hired from Ivies and Stanford. I think her internship helped her greatly in getting into a top 4-5 law school. We are again at a crossroad of be a full pay at that top law school or take the scholarship from a lower ranking law school. A very good friend of D2 was just offered an assistant editor job at a major newspaper. He also went to a top ranking school. The competition was fierce because the job paid over 70K with benefits. They had a lot of applicants and they had to use some filters to limit number of people they wanted to interview.
If your parents are liquidating their 401K or emptying out all of their savings acct to pay for Yale then your family can't afford it. On the other hand, if your parents had put away money and planned on paying for your college (maybe in state), then I wouldn't miss out on the opportunity of going to Yale. I am in no way saying one couldn't get a very good education from UW, but it is different than what you would get Yale. You need to make a decision as to what it is worth to you (family).

25.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
"The competition was fierce because the job paid over 70K with benefits."

The thing that struck me about this is that a job like this isn't very tough to get regardless of the college you went to _outside_of_prestige_industries_.

I realize there are more important things than money, but for the sake of argument...

A physician graduating from Harvard undergrad will make exactly as much money as a graduate from a small extension campus of a state university. Undergrad has nothing to do with compensation.

In the situation above, where the recent graduate got the $70K per year job: I assume her alternate path would be a lesser paying job, say $40,000 just for discussion. Say both jobs are in California. the 70K job will take home about 52K after federal, state, social sec, medicare, etc. The 40K job will take home will take home about 33K for a difference of 19K per year.

Keeping the arithmetic simple 240K divided by 20K is a 12 year payback. But the arithmetic is not that simple. If the 240K were invested it would likely double resulting in a payback of 24 years. And that assumes that a 22 year old would start saving 100% of the difference between the two jobs, the likelihood of which is about zero. So the real time to pay back easily exceeds a quarter century for most people.

I am not arguing that making more money is pointless. However, giving up savings and compounding investment returns in exchange for a system of progressive taxation a questionable choice. The same is true on the other end of the workalike calendar. If you are nearing retirement, would you rather have saved more than enough or hope that your final years are the highest paying and maybe you can save the difference realizing that is precisely when companies will wonder about younger, less expensive replacements? I would pick savings.

A hard to calculate factor is that compensation arc. For the physician, the slope of the arc is zero. It just doesn't matter where a person did undergrad. For many other jobs, the Ivy league graduate might have an accelerated compensation arc over a career, mitigating the time for payback of the more expensive education.

To be in the publishing business getting paid 70K 1-2 yrs out of college is very hard. A lot of new graduates are doing it for free as an intern. You can't get the job if you can't even get an interview.

29.<<<DecisionHelp>>>
It seems to me that if I were not interested in medschool, Yale might the the better option. As most STEM people are able to get into gradschool for a relatively low price.

30.<<<BKSquared>>>
Agree with the financial analysis of @WISdad23 above. Given the huge disparity in total net costs, I think it is an easy decision if the OP is pretty certain of med school and if the prospects of getting into a good med school between Madison and Yale are equivalent, absent OP's family being so wealthy that the extra quarter million bucks +- is immaterial to them. If, however, the prospects of med school are not so certain, the calculus does change somewhat. Then it is a question of what Madison offers as likely alternatives to Yale in other departments/interests both academically and student life-wise. Here we have 2 very different institutions. The OP may thrive in both or one may offer a superior fit vs. the other. Besides money, we have to consider the value of the experience for 4 very critical years that OP can never get back.

I shared a personal anecdote on another similar thread involving Georgia Tech vs Harvard. My brother chose to go to an honors program of a top public institution. He ended up at a great med school and then on to residency at one of the top programs in his specialty. He is very successful and happy. He wanted to be a doctor from childhood. However, I am only aware of one friend of his from undergrad that he maintains regular contact with. I, on the other hand, had no clue what I wanted to do/be entering college. I did not decide on a major until junior year. Going to law school was almost a default. My closest friends these days though are predominantly my buddies from Yale. About a dozen of us still take an annual boys' long weekend trip each year. They are successful doctors, lawyers, bankers, engineers, business owners and journalists -- I think we have all made each other smarter and better people. So for me, the money my family invested in Yale was well worth it.

31.<<<sevmom>>>
@BKSquared There are lots of personal anecdotes out there of people at large public schools that made plenty of lifelong friends there. Just because that did not happen for your brother does not mean it does not happen for other people. Maybe he was more focused on his studies, or was not as social as you. Who knows. You will never know what would have happened for you had you attended a school like UW. My guess is most kids have a lot of fun there! As they do at Yale. Good luck to the OP with the decision!

32.<<<seaotter17>>>
60k of debt sounds like a nightmare. You couldn't give me all of the Yale sweatshirts, mugs, and car decals in the world for 60k in debt when a full ride at a superb school is available. Just my $0.02.

33.<<<DecisionHelp>>>
So correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that medical schools care less about the school attended and more so about GPA and MCAT stats. In which case it doesn't sound like Madison would really hamper me when applying for competitive medical schools.

34.<<<bouders>>>
Based on the career results for my extended family, which includes degrees from Yale and other ivies as well as state flagships, go to Yale, no question. Those who went to elite schools got into similar level grad schools and had their pick of well paying positions after grad school (or undergrad) in their location of choice. Those who attended state flagships had a much rougher road.

35.<<<WISdad23>>>
@bouders, so the family members who went to a state school were also accepted to an Ivy and turned it down?

36.<<<SconnieBoy>>>
I come from a small, rural high school in Wisconsin, and one recent (~6 years ago) graduate went to UW Madison for biomedical engineering and is now at MIT for grad school. My parents had similar paths coming from a lesser UW school and ending up at Uchicago for grad school, although that was decades ago. The opportunities are definitely out there.

37.<<<ChLoos>>>
I would go with Madison.

38.<<<starwars1>>>
In my med school class the majority of my classmates were from a non Ivy schools. I went to one of the top NYC med school. But coming out of an Ivy undergrad did open up a lot of doors for me for residency and post grad. However many of my colleagues are not from elite colleges, and very few people ask a doctor which undergrad they attended. Most do care to ask which med school and post grad training. So if your goal is to go to med school it going to Madison is fine as long as you study hard and get great grades. Buy mediocre grades will certainly not help. Once you get into med school, going to Yale as undergrad in the long run is only to build up your own self esteem.

41.<<<theloniusmonk>>>
I know someone in a similar situation, and they didn't go with Yale, party due to the costs and Yale's pre-med weed out program. If you make the weed out program, you will get good resources for med school app, mcat etc., if not, you're kind of on your own. It was also full pay for them and no or little play at the other college.

I suggest that one read Stumbling on Happiness and recognize that we humans cannot predict what will make us happy. I suspect the opinions of an 18-year-old about liking or disliking a particular U are based upon rather superficial factors and are not predictive of what his actual experience there would be. Every large University will offer a rich set of experiences, peers and opportunities.

This young man may benefit from learning how to make the most out of the opportunities that present themselves rather than beginning this phase of life a sour grapes attitude. The opportunity to attend any of the extraordinarily high quality campuses in the UW system is extraordinary 

I lifted that from another site and think its insightful

Personally I would go to Yale however.

43.<<<~~~>>>
I wonder if you want just to go a medical school or a top research medical school. Which practice area do you plan to specialize in?

Ive seen some clients having over half million dollars student loan for medical schools. However they have all paid back their loan in few years and acquired nice big residents. I have only one client taking long years to pay down his medical school loan.

60k may be or not a large debt depending on your plan / goal.

44.<<<JenniferClint>>>
I'd go to Yale

45.<<<Alexandre>>>
Wisconsin is the way to go if you are seriously considering medical school. Medical schools do not usually differentiate between universities at that level, and you want to save as much money as possible for medical school. But if you are not certain, or if you think you may change your mind, as do roughly have premed students, I think Yale may be worth a look, although I am not sure $60k of debt is worth it.

46.<<<AlmostThere2018>>>
@DecisionHelp -- Have you decided? Lots of good info provide, and I think you can justify either decision. Good luck and let us know!! I know you'll do really well either way!

47.<<<manyloyalties>>>
Assuming that the total debt is going to be 60,000, rather than 240,000, the advice to go to Madison(which is a common theme here on CC) is, in my view, catastrophically poor advice. To begin with, over the course of a succesful career in medicine, 60,000 is effectively meaningless. Just do the math of lifetime earnings of a physician. To turn down a superior opportunity over 60,000 is poor thinking. So, is Yale superior? The posters keep saying it doesnt matter where you go undergraduate for med school admissions, but that is absolutely false. Yale, as a matter of fact, gets a higher percentage of students, at a lower GPA, then Madison into medical school. Medical school admission rates are as low as Stanford and Harvard for undergraduate. Wouldnt you want every advantage. And to suggest that because people at Yale are smarter than people at Madison that your grades will be lower proportionately, is also not factual. Top schools are known for grade inflation and helping students. And Madison has many talented students in pre-med. The idea that you can breeze through pre-med weed out courses at Madision and would struggle at Yale is simply guess work. But the flawed nature of the advice, even from a financial perspective, comes out when you take a closer look at med school admissions and merit aid. Top med schools also have better financial aid and better MERIT aid. If you do well at Yale, you will be much more likely to be accepted at a top medical school with better aid and medical school is much much more expensive than undergraduate. And if you want MERIT aid for medical school, you better be a top top applicant. Now, if the amount is 240,000, that is different story because then you may end up borrowing on top of that amount for medical school, and that total number will balloon. I am not knocking Madison at all. Great school. But the poor advice here needs to be addressed.

48.<<<starwars1>>>
But it would be kind of a shame to lose the opportunity to go to Yale, when there are tens of thousands of kids out there with Yale being their dream school, who aren't accepted and can never attend. As a doctor, especially if you end up specializing, that 60K plus the cost of med school really wouldn't be a terrible burden. You most likely will be able to pay if off a few years into your practice. But if you intend to go into academic medicine or just do family practice, then financially it might become a bit tight. Yale is a brand name giving you opportunities to open up a lot of doors.

49.<<<privatebanker>>>
Its not just 60k its that plus 200k for med school. And that is a burden during internship and residency. And depending on specialty for a decade after. Just ask my younger brother.

50.<<<manyloyalties>>>
That is precisely my pointprivate banker. The bigger financial play is medical school. Medical school is running closer to 80,000 a year or more. I would easily invest 60,000 to go to a university, Yale, that would carefully guide me through the medical school process with personalized advice and great classes to obtain a more affordable medical school education either by admission to one of the low cost great medical schools (Baylor or UT-southwestern) or to obtain quality financial aid or MERIT aid for medical school. That is leaving aside the fact, left out of the advice here, that medical school admission rates at less than elite medical schools are running around 5% and even very strong students are being rejected. If your dream is medical school, why wouldnt you invest 60,000?

51.<<<AlmostThere2018>>>
I was also wondering if Madison would have tougher intro courses b/c of weed out mentality at public flagships vs. Yale not feeling that same pressure. My D. seriously considered UNC for bio and got impression that intro classes would be somewhat impersonal, large, and very tough. Prolly similar to Madison. (She ended up choosing an LAC)

Of course all colleges want high med acceptance rates so I imagine they all weed out to an extent at the front end, even Yale. But just seems like Yale might be more supportive environment. But 60k is a lot to pay for that. . .

52.<<<manyloyalties>>>
AlmostThere, a constant theme of CC is unrealistic expectations. Lots of good students expect to get admitted to, pick your school, but dont think seriously about 8 or 9 % admission rate. A medical school with an 8 or 9 % admission rate is a non selective school, relatively speaking. George Washington Medical school, for example, had an under 3% admission rate. And they are picking those 8 or 9 % or 3% out of a carefully cultivated group of high achieving students. That is, getting into medical school is just like getting into Ivy League caliber schools and now requires the same resume building stuff for undergraduate but ramped up, research, community service, recommendations. Telling someone whose dream is medical school to give up the advantage that Yale offers for admission in terms of reputations, personalized attention, and research opportunity to save 60,000 is poor advice, IMHO.

53.<<<Hapworth>>>
As the majority of posters have written, UW-Madison.

OP, the only thing that's tugging at you is the brand name of Yale. Funny thing about college choice: it is both a significant but a not-so-really life-altering decision as people think. The decision about where to attend seems bigger than it really is. For instance, many, many students wish they could be in your shoes and attend Madison.

Another issue, and I hope this isn't too personal. But if you are expected to pay full freight at Yale, this means that your family is full pay. I understand that some full pay families are right on the bubble, expected to cover the complete COA even though a family might feel that this is beyond their means. However, if I am reading things right, your family is willing to pay 220K towards your Yale education, and you are expected to handle the remaining 60K?

Question: why aren't you or your parents suggesting what strikes me as the obvious? "Son (or dear daughter), you will attend UW-Madison, and we will finance your medical school costs up to 220K." In other words, if medical school is in your future, why spend so much of everyone's money (yours (in the form of future debt) and your parents') on undergrad? Am I missing something?

If your family could comfortably afford Yale, that would be different. If the debt were lower (let's say 30K, which many students do take on; debt is the reality for most college students), maybe that would change things, too (even though I don't think Yale is worth 30K in debt, not when the other option is practically free). I wish you the best, though.

54.<<<starwars1>>>
The 200K is presumably constant despite whatever undergrad one attends. So would you go to Yale with 260K debt or to Madison with 200K debt? Not much of a difference in the grand scheme.

55.<<<privatebanker>>>
@manyloyalties I think Yale is worth the investment. In nearly all instances But for medical school applications many top med schools love the stars coming out of state flagships. If the kid is this bright, I would be surprised if they werent uber elite at their flagship and get into the better med school. I think top undergrad school Yale coupled with inexpensive but good med school is less valuable long term tha. UW coupled with a top 15 med school. When discussing your dr do you mention wher they went undergrad or med school. For me it may not even come up where they ent undergrad.

But its no mistake going to Yale of course. Its Yale. And for all the obvious reasons. But I do believe that people underestimate the quality of education and guidance available at a school like UW.

I would go to Yale myself. But Im not writing the checks So its easy for me to say.

56.<<<Midwestmomofboys>>>
Re-read the posts, may have missed some still but -- OP says they have to personally borrow $15 a year , as a student, to get through Yale, and family will struggle but manage the rest of the cost of full pay at Yale. The alternative is full tuition award at Madison, so costs are room and board, books, travel to MN which would be about $12-15k a year, total. If the med school goal is unwavering and committed, then UW seems the only affordable option (and a great one at that). OP cannot borrow $15k a year personally, and it sounds like family paying the remainder of full pay at Yale may well involve debt, since OP says it will be a struggle. Substantial debt for undergrad or using family resources for undergrad which could be preserved to contribute to med school, just does not make sense. And, if the merit award at UW includes any perks -- research access etc., so much the better. If not, OP should apply to participate in the UW undergrad research scholars program, which gets freshman and sophomores teamed up with faculty research.

If a student were saying Wall Street/finance/ consulting -- then yes, Yale could make sense, as that name opens doors. But med school? no.

Madison is a great school and its stars will do well. On the overall scale, going to Madison to go to medical school is a fine choice. But this is a comparative question and the posters who say going to Madison is the easy choice, or that 60k in debt is too much are simply ignoring the exceptionally low admission rates to medical school now and the possible financial benefits to being a top applicant. The facts are simple: as strong a school as Madison is, going to to Yale provides a far better opportunity for admission and for medical school money. I will pick an easy example. Baylor is a great medical school and very very affordable. If you get into Baylor, you will save 200k in debt for medical school. Getting in is very very hard with incredible competition. You have a much better shot of getting into Baylor from Yale than Madison. Case Western has a FREE, five year medical school. You have a much better chance of getting into the free top medical school from Yale than Madison. And, Ill say it again, you cant simply go to class, get good grades take the MCATs and get into medical school now anymore than you can go to high school, get good grades, take the SATs and go to Dartmouth. You need a four year, programmed, organized, supported effort including research, community service, recommendation letters and top grades and test scores. That grueling process is much more likely to result in admission from Yale than Madison. Again, not knocking Madison, but if your dream is medical school, and you want to lower the cost of medical school, going to Yale and investing 60,000 is the easiest of easy choices.

They might not have the 60k period. And I politely disagree that high gpa high mcat score student from uw with research has any disadvantage to Yale. The same scores perhaps a little. Its just not the current experience. More students at Yale are bright enough to get into med school so more will go. UF Sent the 2nd most students get into med school last year nationally. As an example. Yale will have better support in general and is a more prestigious undergrad. If you dont end up going to med school as the vast majority end up deciding the Yale degree means more over time. Assuredly.

Im not knocking Madison, and the state flagships do well. But at 3% admission rates mean that even slight advantages have a great impact on the outcome. And I dont mean prestige in the abstract, I mean the opportunities, professors, and support. Log onto the pages of the top medical schools and see where the students come from, Yale is always well represented. I didnt go to Yale, or Madison, and like both schools. But I dont think reasonable people can disagree that Yale outperforms Madison in medical school placement, with greater margin for error in grades, better research opportunities, and more personalized support. The question is, is that worth 60,000 when you can earn far more than 60,000 in reduced medical school cost and a better chance of admission. It seems to me that it absolutely is. If they dont have it all, then why pose the question. Life doesnt always give easy or obvious choices. Borrowing the 60,000 has some element of risk, with a great benefit, personal and financial. Not borrowing, has other risks, such as more expensive medical school, maybe no medical school, or a school you dont want to go to. Or, if you switch careers, less opportunity. I just think measured against the posters overall earning capability and in light of ambitious goals, aiming high is the right way to go.

Most kids entering college as a premed do not stick to their plan. Either they find something better, or the premed course work is way too difficult. Coming out of Yale, again, will open up a lot of doors and resources for your other options.

Okay, @manyloyalties makes some strong points (BTW, did you go to medical school? Not being argumentative. If not, it sounds like you still know a lot, much more than an English major like me :-) ).

But shouldn't we bring up the unmentioned (or it probably is mentioned, but there are so many posts in this thread!)? We all know that the ground is littered with the bones of once-hopeful pre-med students. We all personally know friends, family members, and classmates who started out pre-med but switched to another "major" (pre-med, of course, is not a major). One friend of mine who attended UIUC became pre-law. My roommate in college went to dental school.

Clearly, the OP is bright; otherwise, he wouldn't have been admitted to Yale. Any idea how many Yalies get weeded out? I'm not questioning the OP's devotion or desire, but if medical school at some point is not an option, what should he do? Is Yale still worth the 60K (plus his family's substantial payment) because it can open doors? If the OP's plan is to immediately enter the job market, maybe? The starting salaries from top schools are higher (don't worry, people, the other grads from other schools catch up over time). Also, there's the trend (disturbing, IMO) of how Wall Street poaches all sorts of Ivy grads (not just economics grads) for two years of grueling but well-paid work. These students get run through the mill, working 80+ hours per week, and essentially lose two years of their lives and often regret the decision after. But they do get paid a bundle.

If med school does not pan out, Madison is perhaps the stronger choice if the OP plans to go to grad school, which is far less dependent on the name of the undergrad institution. He can get into a top STEM grad school program via Madison or New Haven.

Thoughts?

I did not go to medical school, but several family members did, and applied recently, and so I learned all about the frenzy of medical school admissions, which continue to be absurdly brutally competitive in ways that make college admissions seem like childs play. Twenty or more applications to schools with 3% admissions, costs of 80,000 a year and rising. Paying for medical school is no joke and by then family resources are long gone, even though medical schools require consideration of those same resources. And, as with undergraduate, the best medical schools have the most need and merit aid, so getting into the top schools is a cheaper option in many cases, which makes those schools even harder to get into. That being said, who knows about switching careers. No choices are that simple but you cant go wrong with either Madison or Yale on an absolute scale. Yale is better if you wanted to go to Wall Street and Madison is better for a lower paid career, I assume. The Poster is in good shape. I guess my point overall is that the 60,000 cant be considered without also considering the impact on medical school admissions and cost.
