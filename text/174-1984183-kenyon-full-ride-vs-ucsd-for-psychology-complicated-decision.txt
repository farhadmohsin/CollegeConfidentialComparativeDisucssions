Hi,
Trying to determine whether it is beneficial to pay a total (over all four years) of $50,000 more for my daughter to attend UCSD for Psychology undergrad than Kenyon. Attending UCSD would require max loans for her and loans for me to cover most of the remaining cost, less any amount I’m able to cover in payments which I would be making from day one. I have expected to take out loans all along and can afford to make payments, just can’t afford to pay full amount due each year. At Kenyon, she essentially has a full ride for this year (roughly $1,000 net cost, no loans) and should have similar funding for the remaining three years assuming financial need doesn’t change dramatically. She was selected as a STEM scholar which means no loans or work study for all four years, but I’m not certain yet how need based aid will look for the next three years. I know need based aid is not guaranteed, although I’m confident we would get some. The no loans aspect is guaranteed for all four years-she does not need to maintain a certain GPA to stay in the STEM scholar program, just needs to be making progress toward her degree.
I realize on the surface this probably seems like a no-brainer, but I don’t think Kenyon is known for their Psychology program and want to do what I can to improve her chances of getting into grad school. I realize that Kenyon is a very good school in general. An additional complication is that, due to her health, I would have to move to Ohio to be accessible to her in case her health starts to decline. I have no problem doing this, assuming I can find a job, but don’t want to go to this effort if Kenyon’s psychology program isn’t highly regarded. We live very close to UCSD. From looking at both schools’ catalogs it is clear that UCSD offers many more courses, but is that worth the additional cost? Will she be at a disadvantage when applying to grad school since Kenyon’s psych offerings are limited? I know in general undergrads have more opportunities for research at LACs than larger state schools, but do you have any idea whether Kenyon would be able to provide good research opportunities since it is so rural? Is there any way to research psychology grad school admits for Kenyon graduates?
Thanks in advance for your input-sorry I have so many questions. I will also ask Kenyon these questions, but wanted to ask here also.

2.<<<Eeyore123>>>
It looks like Psychology is their 4th largest major. Grad school shouldn’t be an issue but I would still ask them.

3.<<<menloparkmom>>>
Many, many college students change their mind regarding their choice of major. It may be that she does as well, and that could change your outlook.
Will the cold weather on Ohio have a negative impact on her health?
It is a small college and she could get a bad case of “cabin fever” once  there, given that she currently lives in a large metropolitan area in Calif.
Will your financial situation change much if you move to Ohio? Do you currently own your home? If so the profits from the sale could impact her FA going forward. I dont like the idea of a one year “full ride”. Perhaps you could ask Kenyon to  sweeten the pot and increase her offer to cover 4 years ? In other words, a scholarship, rather than loans?
If I were you, If they can’t or wont’, given that you had planned on taking out loans anyway, I’d stay in SD.

4.<<<kalons>>>
hi there. i don’t know much (if anything) about ucsd, but i looked into kenyon quite a bit. kenyon offers psychology and neuroscience, and my admissions counselor explained an Off-Campus Activities Program in Psychology (OAPP) is offered which allows students to take advantage of its relationship with the James Cancer Hospital in Colombus to volunteer/pursue internships there. kenyon ends up placing students in very good graduate schools, so i would not worry about that.

5.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@Eeyore123 thank you, I did see that also, but wasn’t sure how much weight to put on that since it is such a small school. Your response is reassuring.
@menloparkmom  The weather will not have any impact on her health, cabin fever is an additional concern and is hard to quantify. She is not currently a super social person, but no way to know how she’ll feel once at college. She will definitely miss the beach although having seasons would be nice.
My financial situation shouldn’t change much. I expect to make less on an annual basis, but pretty close to the same amount when factoring in cost of living difference. I do not own a home, so no concern there. She is guaranteed no loans or work study for the entire four years and Kenyon claims to meet full need, which they certainly did this year. I am concerned that they will reduce need based aid in future years which could potentially increase net cost-meaning they might determine her need is less resulting in less financial aid and higher cost to us with them deciding the amount doesn’t require a loan? Not sure I’m making myself clear with this question. Additionally, is this not really a concern since she has the no loan guarantee for all four years? Trying to look for potential loopholes that I could be overlooking. Don’t need any surprises next year!!

6.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@kalons Oh!! that’s great, definitely something to add to our list to ask Kenyon about

7.<<<bopper>>>
As far as the major goes, all colleges have psychology. If she wants to end up as a psychologist, it will be about Grad School, not undergraduate.

8.<<<MYOS1634>>>
I believe that a higher percentage of  students get into graduate school from Kenyon than from UCSD. And psychology at Kenyon is quite good - a psychology major from Kenyon would have that as an advantage, not something to overcome.

9.<<<Midwestmomofboys>>>
I’m not specifically familiar with Psych programs so I could be wrong, but I generally thought that Masters programs are generally full pay, by the student, so not having loan debt would be ideal for a student pursing a Masters. On the other hand, a candidate for a Ph.D. program should be fully funded, that is, the university waives the student’s tuition, and will pay them a (sometimes barely) living stipend, with the student having to work as a TA in exchange.
Kenyon is about an hour away from Columbus, so that coordination program sounds like it would be perhaps once a week, and a student would need a car if the school does not provide van or other transportation for participating students.
An email to the administrative assistant for the Psych dept, asking who would be best equipped within the department to answer questions about preparation for grad school and past track record for grad school admission, would be a way to get the OP’s questions in front of someone with knowledge.  The other approach is to email the Chair of the department directly, but sometimes those emails can get lost in the shuffle.  We found that contacting the support staff for the department often meant they pointed us in the direction of the person who would be most responsive. I would also recommend a more detailed conversation with Financial Aid, asking about what might happen to aid if parent relocates etc.
Congrats to the OP’s daughter on her wonderful options!

10.<<<Eeyore123>>>
How close do you think you need to live to her? I have never been to Gambier (will be there a week from Friday), but it doesn’t sound like the place that an adult finds a job and apartment. If you are able to be an hour away by car, that opens up the greater Columns and Cleveland areas.

11.<<<Midwestmomofboys>>>
Yes, there is not much in Gambier for an adult looking for employment, unless they worked for the College. Mt Vernon is about 10-15 minutes away, more of a town, with the usual chains and franchises, but still not a lot in terms of employment. Columbus is about an hour away, much of it on back roads, so not a mindless commute. Cleveland is close to 2 hours.
Gambier really is the middle of nowhere . . . .you either love it, or not!

12.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@Eeyore123 I’m comfortable being up to an hour away, most likely Columbus area. I don’t want to be on top of her, she needs space to be a kid, just need to be close enough to keep an eye on her health and help her if necessary. Do you have someone attending Kenyon? (although it seems to be beautiful, not sure why else anyone would go there, lol)

13.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
As others have pointed out, as far as psychology goes, whether her interests are clinically and/or research-based, grad school will be the name of the game. The types of close relationships with professors that she will be able to develop at a place like Kenyon will be unmatched at a large, public university. These relationships, in turn, will translate into better recommendations and more support.
Does she need to major in a STEM field to maintain her status as a STEM Scholar?
Why not see how she is doing health-wise before you start moving across country?

14.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@LoveTheBard Yes,she needs to remain in a STEM field to maintain STEM scholar status. Although her specific intended major has changed over the years, as typical for most kids, they have all been STEM related so I think it is safe to think she will at least stay in a STEM program, even if she does change her mind from Psychology.
Her health has greatly improved. Myself and her medical team initially thought she would need to take a gap year, but based on her progress are comfortable with her attending college as long as I am nearby to check in on her regularly. I don’t have anything in San Diego that keeps me here, truly don’t mind moving…looking at it as an adventure. I do have a good job, they have been super understanding in regard to my need for a modified schedule due to her illness, but now that she’s doing better that isn’t as much of an issue. We do still need to visit the school and see if it will be a good fit for her, no reason to make the move if it’s clear that she will be miserable.

15.<<<MYOS1634>>>
What will happen to your job when you leave?
(Although it may mean more need based aid, it won’t really help if you can’t afford rent and food for yourself  )

16.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@MYOS1634 I’m going to have to find one…clearly another issue to consider. I’ve done a quick search and there are certainly jobs I qualify for…actually being hired is another story. I will start inquiring more seriously in the next week or so.

17.<<<ucbalumnus>>>

[/quote]

Seems like UCSD is too expensive.
If you live near UCSD, was FA insufficient there?  Or, if no FA, does this cost assessment assume commuting from home or living at the school?

18.<<<MYOS1634>>>
All in all, for a kid who wants to do into research, Kenyon, being a highly selective LAC with lots of resources and professors who have been hired because of their ability to integrate undergraduates into their research, is ideal - especially due to the full ride.
Your having to switch jobs isn’t ideal though. Even if jobs are plentiful, the problem isn’t finding  job, it’s finding a good, stable job with good pay and benefits. Is your current job portable? Does your company have branches in the Columbus area?
Are you sure you have to move? Could you plan with the college’s health system, set up a plan for her so that she’s checked regularly by a doctor recommended by her hospital or knows what to do?

19.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@ucbalumnus UCSD gave her the least financial aid out of all schools she was admitted to including the other 2 UC schools. I was pretty disappointed with their package. She qualifys for full Cal Grant and small Pell grant, and UCSD is giving her $3,360. This leaves us with loans in the amount of $12,476 per year and work study of $1,800. Then, as I’m sure you know, this amount will likely increase each year with the expected rise in tuition. I was hoping for more, but UCSB and UCSC offered similar amounts so it is what it is.

20.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
So net price of $14,276 at UCSD, but you can actually afford $0?
If you can actually afford to contribute without loans about $5,000 (possibly some of which may come from saving the amount of food and utilities that she consumes at home), then she would need $9,276 (typical amount of student contribution expected by UCs), which would be covered by $5,500 federal direct loan, $1,800 work study, and $1,976 other work earnings (e.g. summer and/or non-work-study part time jobs during the school year).

21.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@MYOS1634 true, switching jobs isn’t ideal. Unfortunately, my job is not portable. It is a small company, the only other branch is in Northern California. I work in accounting so at least there are usually jobs available most places.
She needs close supervision by someone with great knowledge of her condition and effective treatment, it’s too important and unrealistic to put in the hands of the college health system. Actually unfair to put this responsibility on them. If I am not personally near her, she will not be allowed (by her current medical team) to attend. Finding employment will be an additional determining factor that will certainly be huge in the ultimate decision.

22.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
How well does she know about her medical care needs, in terms of whether she knows enough to give accurate information to physicians and seek appropriate medical care when needed?  Eventually, she will have to be able to do this on her own.

23.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Right now, it does seem that qkenyon is her only affordable choice. It istuwntkey, wn excellent choice for what she wants to do but it does place w burden on you. Being an accountant will help - there will be accounting jobs in Columbus and around. Or perhaps reach out to Kenyon - for all you know THEY need an accountant.  In all seriousness, perhaps you can delay the choice for a month, see if she can do an overnight, you go with her and while she’s in campus you’re figuring things out wrt a job?

24.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@ucbalumnus she knows a lot about her medical care and needs. At this time it is not appropriate to leave in her hands, but she is gradually taking responsibility for her care.

25.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@MYOS1634 Yeah, it goes without saying that Kenyon is without a doubt the most affordable choice. I’m not sure what the secret code word is in the second sentence of your reply, but it seems like it’s something positive. 
I could make it work to cover the cost of UCSD, or any of the other schools that all came close to the same net cost, if I had to. She got a lot of great offers.  I have no idea at this point if she will still want to attend grad school when it comes time for that, but I have learned from (mostly) lurking on these forums for the last few years to save the $$ for grad school if possible. Gonna have to get busy working on seeing if we can make this work!!
Intending to go for an overnight so both of us can get more info regarding all aspects of the situation.

26.<<<crttrlvr>>>
Going back to one of my original questions…is there a website or something that I can refer to that shows the psych majors admitted to grad school from various colleges/universities? One of the reasons I started this thread is because one of my daughter’s doctors told her that she “has” to attend a top tier university (UCSD) to have any hope of getting into grad school. My daughter has great respect for this doctor so she’s hesitant to just take my word for it that she’s better off at an LAC. I learned from cc essentially what all of you told me…a student is better off at a small LAC due to research opportunities and more personal relationships with professors. I needed unbiased opinions from all of you to show her, but a reliable source that shows the facts would be helpful as well. She’s a facts sort of girl.

27.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
What kind of “grad school”?
PhD programs’ sensitivity to school prestige (in major) appears to vary by subject.
Law school is mostly about college GPA and LSAT score.  See http://lawschoolnumbers.com .
Medical schools tend to first screen by college GPA and MCAT score, then holistic review considers many factors, including pre-med extracurriculars, interview, etc…  You may want to ask more in the pre-med forum section.
Unfortunately, UCSD’s career survey is not very informative: https://career.ucsd.edu/alumni/alumni-survey/index.html
Kenyon has some information at http://www.kenyon.edu/after-kenyon/graduate-schools-and-preprofessional-programs/ .

28.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@ucbalumnus assuming she doesn’t change her mind, she would continue in Psychology. Whether she would want to go so far as a PsyD is unknown at this point. Thanks for the links 

29.<<<twoinanddone>>>
I’d stay in California with a sure thing job.  It is a lot of stress on both of you to move, start new jobs, new school, new climate, all in a short amount of time (May to Sept).

30.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
PhD should be funded (tuition waiver, living expense stipend, typically in exchange for teaching assistant or research assistant work).
PsyD will be expensive.

31.<<<AroundHere>>>
With the description of a medical team, I’d be worried about good doctors, hospitals, and health insurance plans. If there isn’t an appropriate practice in town, how far of a drive from Kenyon is the nearest specialist?

32.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@twoinanddone it is stressful, but to be honest I’ve wanted to get out of California since my daughter was very young. I decided if it didn’t happen before she started school I wouldn’t move. It didn’t happen and here we are. At least going under these circumstances I won’t have to worry about her since all her costs will be covered except for personal items. Having said that, it is a big decision not to be taken lightly

33.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@AroundHere There are specialists in Columbus, Cleveland and Cincinnati; possibly some closer, but certainly in the larger cities. It’s about an hour to Columbus from Kenyon. She wouldn’t have to see specialists regularly unless she starts to go downhill. She can be followed by a Family Doctor.

34.<<<citymama9>>>
You don’t need to say what she has, but if this is  a mental illness or eating disorder I wonder if a gap year would be wise to assess how she’s doing and give her time to be stronger and healthier when she starts school.

35.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
If the medical issues could cause a need for emergency care, would emergency rooms in the area have access to specialists who may be needed in such a case?

36.<<<menloparkmom>>>
@crttrlvr
perhaps your DD should ask for deferred enrollment [ aka a gap year]  from Kenyon to get her[ and your] situation stabilized.
Given your concerns about her health issues, it cant hurt to ask.

37.<<<Lindagaf>>>
Full ride at Kenyon? Wow! That’s amazing. I almost can’t believe you even asked, but I mean that in a nice way. There is no questions that she should go to Kenyon. Princeton Review’s list of Best Professors, as rated by colleagues, has Kenyon with 8 professors. Harvard has fewer. She will be well prepared for grad school or a PhD. I am sure she can defer if needed. Congratulations to her!

38.<<<LoveTheBard>>>
@menloparkmom’s suggestion of deferring her enrollment in order to get her – and your – situations stabilized is a good one, and, to echo @Lindagaf, Kenyon is a wonderful option.

39.<<<mouva890>>>
Some of the intro level classs at UCSD are very large (think 400 students). This can be quite overwhelming for a new freshman, and these type of classes are still often taken in sophomore year so definitely something to think about.

40.<<<klmg1234>>>
FWIW I went to Kenyon years ago and knew many psych majors, all of whom went on to get their doctorates from excellent universities.

41.<<<crttrlvr>>>
Hello…I’m back. I needed to step back from this thread to take a breath and refocus on what my daughter wants which is, of course, most important. She made it clear that moving and starting fresh with a new treatment team felt too stressful and overwhelming during an already stressful time. So, she committed to UCSD a couple weeks ago and is a proud Triton. I’m very proud also (not surprising, lol…I am her mom). She has faced some very large obstacles this past year and managed to overcome them and succeed despite not attending school at all her senior year until March and still pushing forward and completing her remaining classes in order to graduate on time (actually will be a little early).
It was hard for me to accept at first; both she and I had always planned on her attending an LAC with state schools as the backup…she applied far and wide, chasing the best financial aid package she could get. Then, circumstances changed and we weren’t sure any school would accept her. Turned out we were wrong, she received many acceptances and ended up having to turn down amazing offers in order to keep her close to home and, as a result, attend a state school. The reality is, there is no shame in attending UCSD, it is a great school and I’m certain she will succeed.
Thank you, all of you, for your input and thoughtful responses. Now that the college search is over, I’ll have to find something else to do with my time other than obsessively read everything I can find on CC. I guess I’ll have to start researching grad schools now!!

42.<<<juillet>>>
Congrats on you and your daughter’s decision, @cttrlvr. I’m glad you found something that worked for you and your family!
You do not need to start researching grad schools now  It’s too early! Let her settle into some career goals and research/professional interests first. I wouldn’t start thinking about a list until junior year at the earliest, once she’s gotten a chance to get some research experience and a little solidity in her career goals and interests.



Also, for the sake of the usefulness of this thread over the long-term your daughter’s doctor is wrong. It is not true that students have to attend a top-tier university to have hopes of getting into graduate school; this is true across fields.* I have a PhD in psychology and I went to a small LAC that is very good but not ranked as highly as Kenyon. Per capita, small liberal arts colleges produce more PhD graduates than large research universities. Colleges like Kalamazoo, Hillsdale, Allegheny, Hendrix, Franklin & Marshall and Occidental are in the top 50 producers of science and engineering (including psychology) PhDs per capita.
I wouldn’t say a student is better off at a small LAC. It’s more that a student who has found a good fit school for her can get into graduate school from wherever she goes, as long as she pursues the kinds of experiences that graduate schools value. Assuming that’s a PhD program in psychology, that would be research experience assisting a professor in their research group, summer research experiences (preferably at another campus and/or with other professors, so she can grow her network), presenting research at conferences, maybe getting a publication (not necessary, but a nice cherry on top). They also include good letters of recommendation and writing a strong personal statement that coherently discusses research interests and career goals, but those things tend to come more naturally after a student has had these kinds of experiences and connections. Good grades and high GRE scores are also necessary. And if she’s interested in clinical psychology, clinical volunteering experience is necessary as well.
A sufficiently motivated student could get that anywhere - a great small liberal arts college or a great large public university. The doctoral students I knew (at my own program and those I created networks with) came from across the spectrum of colleges and universities, from top-tier places to small regional public universities.
*I should add that in some fields - like math or philosophy - undergrad college may matter more.

43.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Congratulations!
And if you find that UCSD is not the right school and the medical issues settle, then she could transfer. As for your your dream of moving out of California has been pushed back four years (at most). In the grand scheme of things, not that long for an adult.
Your daughter will be fine :). Congratulations to her for being on incredible in such difficult circumstances.

44.<<<crttrlvr>>>
@juillet thank you for your insight, I greatly appreciate it!
@MYOS1634  You are correct; I’ve waited 17 years, I can wait longer    and you’re right, she will be fine!
