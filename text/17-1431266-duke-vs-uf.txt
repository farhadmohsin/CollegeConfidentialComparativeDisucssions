Alrighty, I was just accepted into Duke Early Decision and for the past couple days I have been extremely stressed out.

2.<<<texaspg>>>
You can not take student loans, more than 5k or some such number. Your parents need to cosign your loans.

3.<<<kenyanpride>>>
Talk to Duke about your financial situation and see if they are willing to accommodate you. Frankly, I don't think it would be a good idea to renege on your commitment to Duke, but I guess it can't be helped in light of the extenuating circumstances.

4.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@texaspg

Yes, I know. They have to take out the federal PLUS loan... or something like that.

So, technically my parents would be paying for all of it, but I would have to pay back the loan after I graduated.

5.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@kenyanpride

I plan on talking to Duke... but what if they offer no other financial assistance?

And technically I'm not "renegading" on my commitment to Duke. The commitment is conditional based on the family's ability to pay.

"Should a student who applies for financial aid not be offered an award that makes attendance possible, the student may decline the offer of admission and be released from the Early Decision commitment."

^^That is straight from the Early Decision contract.

6.<<<bud123>>>
Talk to Duke fin. aid and your parents. You can't go $160,000 in debt for Duke plus more debt for grad school. You will be stuck with debt the rest of your life.
Of course a UF degree doesn't equal a Duke degree but if you excel at UF you should be able to continue to grad school and be free as a bird with no debt. If you can get the Duke debt to a managable level, maybe $10,000/year go to Duke.

7.<<<username29>>>
You cannot just say my parents are only going to pay X you have to show that's all they can pay

8.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@bud123 @username29
Thank you so much! This is really good advice.

9.<<<tennisforall>>>
I don't know that there is a good argument to make unless your financial circumstances changed after you applied early decision. This is the first year that the government required schools to provide the net price calculator. If what financial aid sent was similar to the net price calculator results what would be the reason. In my case it was very close.

10.<<<rmldad>>>
I would definitely pick Florida under these circumstances. What if you attend Duke and start you senior year, bringing your parents' debt load to $140k for seven semesters, when heaven forbid you suddenly become ill/hit by bus/other tragedy. They are now stuck with a sizable mortgage payment and no means of paying for it.

Even in the best case scenario, if your parents decide they can double their contribution to $40k/year, you will graduate $80k in debt (assuming their contribution rises with tuition increases) as you start graduate school.

If opportunities arise during your college years (study abroad, co-op employment, etc.) the interest on PLUS loans continues to accrue. You will severly limited in terms of what curriculum enhancements you will be able to take advantage of.

Talk to the FA office to see if they can help. However, I fear that you are simply too far apart in terms of dollars. Good luck!

11.<<<UltimateFrisbee>>>
This is what I really don't understand about college admissions and high school students' decisions. Why apply early decision if you're not absolutely sure that you would be able to bear the burden of the costs, if you do not end up getting a merit scholarship, which very few accepted applicants do and about which you would not find out until spring-time anyway? Sure, Duke is alluring, but is it worth all that (uncertain) debt in your eyes? Otherwise, you face a situation where you are at the mercy of the whims of the financial aid office to hopefully make some meaningful change to your financial aid, which, unless there has been some change in your financial situation between before and after your application, is unlikely. You have to know the risks going in. I'm not trying to worry you, I'm just trying to help paint a clearer picture of the situation and of the high risks of certain decisions.

Also, for the excerpt, "Should a student who applies for financial aid not be offered an award that makes attendance possible, the student may decline the offer of admission and be released from the Early Decision commitment."
Do you realize how ambiguous this is, for a contract? Who's final judgment is it as to what makes attendance possible? Hmm. There can be different interpretations of this statement, and you are at the natural disadvantage of already having an offer that you are not satisfied with and having to force some type of change, which is generally not easy.

12.<<<Leggomyeggo990>>>
Although I am in a similar situation with the financial aid, I think if you really need to you should go to UF. Studies show that it is not the school you attend, but the schools you are accepted to that determine future success. Google the article, I'm sure it's easy to find.

13.<<<tennisforall>>>
What about the person that didn't get an ED offer because you promised to attend? All of the arguments why you should go to UF are valid. So is the argument that you could and should have known exactly what financial aid you would get before you applied.

14.<<<UltimateFrisbee>>>
How would you know your financial aid before applying? You can maybe estimate/predict it through FAFSA (which I think would be after ED decisions come out), but I believe their formulas are proprietary, i.e. only they know them. Some kind of "science", apparently.

15.<<<tennisforall>>>
Go to Duke's net price calculator. You will find it on Duke's web site in the financial aid section. It is very accurate if you provide the correct information and shows your estimated net price based on Duke's formulas.

16.<<<my3gr8boyz>>>
tennis - good point about the spot being given away. Hadn't thought about that one... I guess it could mean one more happier deferred kid come April?

Talking to finaid MAY help, but I agree that without a change in circumstance, where would you get your, umm, let's say "proof that you can't pay".

I'm sorry, I'm sure it doesn't help to have us saying you should have/could have known to a reasonable certainty, about how much aid you would receive. Personally, I would not want to have to renege (it IS "renege" b the way, and not "renegade" ;) ). Did you go in thinking you could always get out of it? And hey, there's always the 4k or so a year that they expect you to pay from a summer job and by doing work study! I know it's not much, but it softens the blow to your parents a bit and is not a loan.

17.<<<Sandrose140>>>
Ok I don't think I should have to be defending my decision of applying early decision to Duke, but here goes nothing.

A year ago if you asked me where I was going to apply to college I would have said Harvard and UF. Then a family friend told me that I could get a ton of MERIT BASED grants and scholarships from second tier schools, so I decided to do my research. Though it seemed unlikely I would get a full ride to Duke I thought I could squeeze by with maybe $20,000 in Work study and grants. Duke is my top choice school and I wanted to have the chance to get these MERIT BASED SCHOLARSHIPS before the regular decision applicants.
ONCE AGAIN... I thought when I got my acceptance letter in the mail I would be getting a package containing incentives for me to attend Duke university. SOO I couldn't use the "net price calculator" to determine my MERIT BASED financial aid.

As to the ability to renege (is this right?) on my Early Decision contract, even if my parents were billionaires (which they're not, for the record) Duke can't force me to attend their college if I (EMPHASIS ON I) can't pay for it. I'm sorry that I'm using all caps but this needs to be said. JUST BECAUSE MY PARENTS CAN PAY FOR IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY WILL. My parents have 100% control over their own finances and they decided they are unwilling to pay for me to go to Duke. I am extremely grateful for the amount they are willing to contribute, unfortunately I am unable to cover the remaining cost without a little help from Duke.

Now, with that being said, I want to attend Duke more than any other University on the planet. I have been reduced to tears the past couple days because the fact that I could attend Duke and am financial unable is heart-breaking for me. I am now looking for less appealing options that are financially in reach.

I started this thread to ask the good people of college confidential if it was worth almost $200,000 dollars in student loans to attend Duke instead of the University of Florida, NOT TO BE SCOLDED BY STRANGERS FOR APPLYING TO DUKE EARLY DECISION.

18.<<<texaspg>>>
Duke has some merit money but most schools don't hand out serious merit money until after regular decisions. EDs should mainly depend on FA. Duke's merit money is not a whole lot and even that is thrown in quite a bit towards those in need.

The only serious merit money is in the Robertson (may have this wrong) or whatever program that goes across UNC and Duke where it is almost free.

I remember seeing a notice earlier in the year that UF was getting rid of computer science program?

19.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@rmldad

Thank you for the helpful advice. You make a valid point when you say that I could miss out on educational opportunities during college...

Question. I know you can't see the future, but is it possible with the competition that's arising to get into a top computer engineering school after undergrad if I don't go to schools like Duke?

20.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@texaspg

Yeah it is the Robertson scholarship where if you're at Duke you take a few courses at UNC.

But I was under the impression that with my acceptance letter would come a package that included some work study, some merit based grants. Apparently times have changed since my family friend attended college, because no such package came in the mail.

21.<<<texaspg>>>
The problem is that the universities do not feel the need to push a package for you if you dont qualify for FA based on parental income and you applied for a binding decision. The schools try to choose full pays during the early rounds as much as they can so they can hold on to the grant money for the regular rounds.

22.<<<goldenboy8784>>>
Call up the Duke Financial Aid office and explain the situation. They might adjust the aid package a certain amount but you really put yourself in a bind by committing to a school that your parents can easily afford but are unwillingly to pay for.

23.<<<UltimateFrisbee>>>
Duke has a few named scholarships but very, very few. If you're still asking about the age-old question of whether it's worth going into huge debt for an elite school rather than going debt-free to your in-state public school, you have to weight the expected payoffs and experiences, long term, with the risks and costs. Having gone to and graduated from Duke engineering when I myself could have gone even beyond full ride to my in-state public school, I will say that I wouldn't trade my experiences there for anything, period, and it has led to me where I am now. But I also don't have $200,000 in debt...is it worth that in debt? Hmm..probably not, to be perfectly honest. It's such a monumental risk to take, and if you're going to continue in graduate school, you're going to go farther down the rabbit hole. That's not considering future mortgages and other real-life stuff that will require you to go into debt. I'm obviously a huge Duke fan since it's my alma mater but, loyalties aside, I'll be the first to tell you that you better think long and hard about decision, especially when considering programs that Duke might not necessarily be world renowned for. p.s. what kind of school would eliminate their comp sci program? That's kind of, um, like the fastest growing sector in...the US? I'd like to know who thought that was a good decision

24.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@UltimateFrisbee
That is why I'm so uncertain! I want to go into computer engineering and UF just tried to completely eliminate it from their school.... (They ended up not).

Also, I thought Duke's computer engineering program was pretty well-known...

25.<<<goldenboy8784>>>

<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/NRC-Rankings-Overview-/124721/" rel="nofollow">NRC Rankings Overview: Computer Sciences - Faculty - The Chronicle of Higher Education</a>

The only private universities that are definitively more highly regarded than Duke for Computer Science are Stanford, MIT, Princeton, Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania. I'm afraid that I'm not knowledgeable on the difference between Computer Science and Computer Engineering however.

26.<<<texaspg>>>
Computer engineering is clubbed more with Electrical and probably more on the hardware side.

27.<<<keylimepie>>>
This topic was discussed recently on the Parents Forum. The situation there is a little different, but a lot of it will apply to you as well. Bottom line  No one can MAKE you go to Duke, but there might be consequences if you break the ED contract.

<url>http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/parents-forum/1413563-how-binding-early-decision.html?highlight=ed+contract</url>

And I am sorry, I dont want to sound like I am scolding you, but the reasons you gave for applying ED are very unconvincing. The few merit scholarships that Duke has are awarded in spring (late March?).
[quote]However, students who wish to compare different schools' financial aid packages or who will depend on merit scholarships to make college affordable should apply Regular Decision.[/quote]
^^ This is straight from the Dukes ED Application instructions.

In any case, keep us posted on your decision. Duke is a great school, but IMHO its not worth $200K in debt.

28.<<<Leggomyeggo990>>>
Could everyone stop being mean? Try imaging how they feels instead of yelling at them for something they can't change. If you have nothing helpful to say than shut up

29.<<<UltimateFrisbee>>>
Umm...did you not consider any of the previous posts helpful? Sigh...

30.<<<username29>>>
[quote]Could everyone stop being mean? Try imaging how they feels instead of yelling at them for something they can't change. If you have nothing helpful to say than shut up[/quote]

I don't like calling people out over message boards, but seriously, the last two pages have incredibly helpful information and also bring up the fact that if you know you have serious financial constraints (parents won't pay) even though you are supposed to pay 60k/year based on the Duke FA Calculator, you shouldn't apply ED and back out. It's different if you were supposed to get a lot of need and didn't or had a family emergency, but that wasn't the car here. You need to chill out. A lot.

31.<<<Elconquistador>>>
In the big picture of things, I don't think you will upset too many people if you choose not to attend Duke. If you hadn't applied ED, does that mean one more person might have been selected? Nobody knows! If it was me, I would ask my parents to pay for your whatever it's going to cost to go to UF and then bank the rest for your graduate school education or as a nest egg to get you off to a great start. That's sort of what my stepmom did for my stepsister.

32.<<<my3gr8boyz>>>
Here is an article from Duke's website stating difference between ECE and Comp Sci:

<a href="http://www.pratt.duke.edu/undergrad/cs-vs-ce" rel="nofollow">Computer Science vs. Electrical and Computer Engineering | Duke Pratt School of Engineering</a>

I don't want to be mean. I don't like when people are mean to each other on threads. I think it is important to be realistic here. I am not aware enough of the financial aid picture to know exactly what could have been known ahead of time, but something I just thought of might be something to think about - are you 18 yet? Can't you declare yourself as no longer a dependent of your parents and then the financial aid is given to you without their assets coming into play?


Again, I have no idea how it all works, and have no idea how calculators work when parents HAVE assets but won't use them... And you did receive something from financial aid with the decision, just not an amount that is do-able? (just clarifying that FinAid DID send something, not that no package whatsoever arrived?) And I'm guessing this lack of aid was due to the info your parents had to put on the CSS Profile? Duke claims to meet 100% of need, though I guess it all depends on how they perceive/asses that need? All good things to talk to FinAid dept about. I can only imagine what a stressful time this must be for you right now and I really hope it all works out for you.

33.<<<texaspg>>>
^ if the above is possible, we will all encourage our kids to emancipate. I don't believe colleges accept this from seniors in high school.

In OPs case, her admission might have been largely depedent on being a fullpay. FA candidates are treated differently in ED rounds and not admitted as freely.

34.<<<my3gr8boyz>>>
OK.. I re-read your "explanation" post and had another idea... Did your parents decide they would not be willing to pay AFTER you applied ED? Maybe that can be your "extenuating circumstance"?

35.<<<my3gr8boyz>>>
Well, I was only suggesting it as a maybe because of this particular circumstance.

Do we need to begin questioning whether OP would've gotten in or not depending on ability to pay? That seems to large of an assumption to make. If it is in fact true that FA ED applicants are treated differently. it is one of those "unspoken" things. Colleges deny the truth in it. BTW - my son got in as a FA candidate.

36.<<<texaspg>>>
They only admit so many full FA candidates in ED round and hold the money for later. Deferral is not considered a rejection. Most schools admit FA candidates in early round via QB although I am not sure if Duke is in QB.

OP has two choices - enroll or reject admission. Trying to emancipate this late in the game - I am sure plenty of people have considered it but schools dont buy it. The planning should have started at least an year or two early.

37.<<<Sandrose140>>>
Ok...
Looking back on everything that was said on the post I do regret applying early decision. I feel bad that I'm starting my adult life "reneging" on a commitment. However, my parents and I honestly felt like I would get some sort of merit based grant in our package. (Notice I said grant and not scholarship, because I know scholarships are awarded later in the year). We were under this impression because my family-friend said that was how it worked when he went to college.

Now, about 20 years later I don't think colleges offer too many merit based grants anymore. My mom and I have a theory that they are so busy paying for everyone else's financial aid (because they cover 100% now a days ) that they don't have enough money left over to give to the "richer" student no matter what their credentials look like.

If I would have known this, I wouldn't have applied early decision, but that's the hindsight bias for you.

Now, as for filing as an independent, you have to be married or have a kid or be 24... lol. I already googled it.

@my3gr8boyz
I never thought about it that way.... My mom is talking to my "personal guidance counselor" (fancy right?) tomorrow, and I'll tell her to bring that up.

Also, pretty much all of the top tier colleges boast "need-blind" acceptance. So I don't think I got in because I didn't qualify for financial aid.... Unless they're doing that behind closed doors.


Thank you guys for all of the help, and you can keep on posting advice if you want. I truly appreciate it. You definitely made my decision making process less stressful. If you guys care, I will keep you posted on my decision when it is made.

38.<<<Obxkid>>>
Hey Sandrose, I just made an account so I could let you know you are not alone. I was also accepted to Duke ED, offered no financial aid, have parents who can but will not pay full tuition (though I appreciate what they are willing to pay), and will be facing a reasonable amount of debt (not as much as you).

I don't know what to do. It is just so tough. I'm right there with you in this being some of the most stressful, emotional few days

To everyone else, I would ask that you cut the guy a break. Sure, applying ED may not be the most thoughtful choice, but I know from experience, when you really want to go to a school and paying seems possible (especially when your parents have the money), they you're going to do everything to get accepted including applying early

39.<<<bud123>>>
Today many top high school students have to make a choice. Spend the family lifetime savings to attend their dream school, take on debt they can never pay off or attend the state flagship with a merit scholarship.
As a result the top private colleges are full of wealthy and low income (need aid) students. The middle and upper middle class students end up at the state flagships. In situations like your's where the parents are felt to be able to pay and will not (or can't) most fin. aid dept.'s will tell you they are sorry and ask you to "step out of the line".

40.<<<UltimateFrisbee>>>
Colleges do offer some amount of merit aid, you just have to be a good enough student to get it. This is including state schools. The Ivy's, I don't think they offer merit aid unless something changed.

As the parent/legal guardian, I will ensure that the applicant abides by the Early Decision commitment outlined above.[/quote]

Did your parents not know what they were signing? Did you tell them not to worry about the money because your family friend said you will get plenty of merit? Since your parents agreed to pay if you were accepted to Duke, I think the decision to renege on this commitment pay up should be your parents not yours.

I think Duke will see a lot more people gaming the ED system because they stack the odds of acceptance so much in favor of the ED students. The percent of acceptance of ED compared to RD will be huge this year.

42.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@Obxkid
I know this sounds bad, but YAY!! I'm glad it's not just me... it just seems like no one at my school applied early decision to any schools, so no one can relate. If you want you should DM me what you decided.
PS I'm a girl lol

43.<<<Sandrose140>>>
@ChiselCheeks
If you look earlier in the post, this issue was discussed.
Also I'm not sure I'm understanding your point in the second comment, lol.

44.<<<kenyanpride>>>
OP, have you ever considered that you might not be worthy of a merit scholarship at a school like Duke? I don't mean to be derisive, but it was undoubtedly foolish of you to apply ED to Duke based on the assumption that you would be one of the handful of people that receive merit aid. As far as giving ED applicants aid is concerned, there is absolutely no quota on how much aid Duke will award (Duke is committed to being a 100% need blind and I for one have been a beneficiary of this policy).
Also, why would Duke 'waste' a merit scholarship on someone who is committed to attend when they could use one to lure a potential POTUS away from Harvard?

45.<<<anghad>>>
Graduating with ($62000x 4) debt... That is the question you should be asking? Is an undergrad worth that much to you. My son applied RD and that is what we plan to ask as him as he wants to go on to med school after.

46.<<<tennisforall>>>
This thread has run its course multiple times and won't die. It was about what obligations you have when you decided to apply ED (legal or ehtical). I can't think of a point of view that hasn't been expressed.
