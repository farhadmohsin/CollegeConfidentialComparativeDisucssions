1.<<<Collegethrows124>>>
I got super lucky and scored a Michigan full ride. But this complicates my decision a lot. I love both schools and could see myself at either. Socially I slightly prefer Michigan and academically I heavily prefer MIT's rigor.

2.<<<123Mom456>>>
Not crazy. If you are smart enough to land a full ride you UM, you will be very successful there. You will have a research and internship opportunities and do well no matter where you go.

3.<<<tseliot>>>
No brainer, especially if grad school is in the picture. Michigan.

4.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Not crazy at all. In 40 years, given conservative real returns of 5% a year, that would be about $2M in today's dollars. That's enough for retirement just by itself. And yeah, if MIT means taking a chunk out of parents' retirement, then it is a no-brainer.

And at a place like UMich with it's plethora of highly-rated departments and grad programs, you can make your education as rigorous as you desire. Just start taking grad school classes if undergrad-level classes aren't challenging enough.

5.<<<Much2learn>>>
@collegethrow124 What is your planned major?

6.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Another way to look at it:

If you do as well in undergrad at UMich as in HS, a master's at MIT/Stanford is well within the range of possibility, and while you get roughly the same opportunities at that point as if you had gone straight to MIT for undergrad, 2 years is a lot less costly than 4 years.

7.<<<Alexandre>>>
I assume you are thinking of majoring in Engineering. Michigan is one of the top 6 or 7 CoE in the country. 2 of MIT's last 4 presidents (Jerome Wiesner and Charles Vest) were Michigan alumni. While MIT is indeed slightly better than Michigan, it is not $250k better. Besides, you said you prefer Michigan to MIT socially, and there is much to be said for "fit". Go to Michigan for college. You can always challenge yourself there and get your PhD or graduate degree from MIT at a later date.

8.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
If your parents would have trouble saving for retirement (or college for younger siblings) if they paid for MIT, that suggests taking the full ride.

PhD programs worth attending should be funded, so cost is not a big concern (though some stipends are bigger than others relative to the local cost of living).

9.<<<harvard_and_berkeley>>>
This is a no-brainer... go to Michigan. Fantastic reputation in STEM. Awesome social life. ZERO COST!

I have met many successful Michigan alumni, and Michigan is one of the only schools I know that every single one of their alumni are fanatical with loyalty and praise.

10.<<<WildestDream>>>
Save the 250K and invest it. Enjoy Ann Arbor!

Not crazy. D took a full tuition merit scholarship at Vanderbilt instead of MIT last year. She is doing CS on premed track,which she probably wouldn't dare to do if she went to MIT due to GPA concerns.

Did you get the Stamps scholarship from U Michigan?? If it is, it is more than a full ride, it is network, leadership opportunities, travel,etc. Best of luck!

14.<<<merc81>>>
I'd think the majority of full-pay students at MIT would have been eligible for a full academic scholarship at another school, yet they nonetheless chose MIT. However, you have stated that you love the excellent UM, a factor, along with costs, that should not be under-regarded.

15.<<<billcsho>>>
^ Majority would not get full ride at UMich or equivalent schools though.

16.<<<merc81>>>
Yes. Along those lines, many full-pay UMich students, as with those of MIT, would have been eligible for a full scholarship elsewhere, yet they nonetheless chose UM.

17.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@merc81, I daresay that all full-pay students at MIT would have qualfied for full-ride scholarships from some school.

But UMich is not Alabama St. I consider UMich to be a Near-Ivy and only a handful of MIT admits would have gotten a full-ride from a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent.

Those are incredibly rare and difficult to get (if you don't count the all-female schools and military academies). Between them, Rice, Duke, UChicago, Caltech, Oberlin, UMich (for OOS), and UVa (for OOS) probably offer fewer than 200 full-rides total.

18.<<<Happytimes2001>>>
Contrarian here. I'd go to MIT. The resources there are far and away beyond U of Michigan. Yes, you will get an close education. No, the opportunities will not be equal. If you want to raise venture capital for your business idea in 10 years, you will want MIT. Ask someone in the field you plan to go into. Opportunities (networking, capital and other cannot be discounted) Are they worth 250K, that depends. But every MIT student can get into other schools on a free ride. Yet, they chose MIT. Might not be your choice. But there are reasons.

19.<<<juillet>>>
I don't think the resources at MIT are "far and away beyond" Michigan, not in a way that would be meaningful to an undergraduate anyway. Perhaps if she were choosing specific doctoral programs, maybe, but as an undergrad I think the resources will be functionally equivalent.

Besides, even if they are a bit better, I don't think they're worth $250K plus interest. Particularly if they are an engineering major, as other people here who hire engineers have repeatedly said that engineers don't get paid more for what college they went to.

If OP is trying to raise venture capital in 10 years I doubt whether they went to MIT or Michigan will be the linchpin in their pitch. It'll be about their work experience, the networks they've built and the idea they have. I work in tech, and I gotta say I know a LOT more Michigan alumni than I know MIT alumni.

20.<<<harvard_and_berkeley>>>
For the folks claiming that every MIT student could have turned down a full-ride someplace else.

Ummmm, no.

Think about it this way... how many students attend the elite elites: HYPMS?

Let's round that off to maybe 8000 students.

And to be fair, we're not talking about full-rides just anywhere... but full-rides to top schools (say, top 50 on USNWR) outside the elite elite.

You think there are that many full-rides out there at top schools?

I find it amusing that folks think a full-ride scholarship to a fantastic school like Michigan is just so blas that anyone at HYPSM could have gotten it and turned it down.

21.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
"The resources there are far and away beyond U of Michigan"

This assertion piqued my interest. What is your background, @Happytimes2001?

@Alexandre attended both UMich and Cornell and stated that he did not see a difference in resources between the two. Are you thus asserting that the resources at MIT are far and away beyond what is available at Cornell?

And what resources are you referring to?

BTW, when it comes to startup founders, from a Crunchbase spreadsheet I analyzed, yes, MIT and Stanford outpace UMich (though UMich isn't too shabby, being in the top 10: <url>https://news.crunchbase.com/news/top-schools-among-founders-raise-big-dollars/</url>), but here's the thing: roughly half or more of those MIT/Stanford alums who were startup founders were _grad_ alums (including PhD's and MBA's). And PhD's are fully fulled while 2 years of a Master's/MBA is significantly cheaper than 4 years of undergrad at MIT at full-pay, which is why I said that if the OP excels as much in undergrad as he has in HS, he will still be able to get the opportunities afforded MIT/Stanford alums.

22.<<<merc81>>>

Did anyone say that though? In my case, I intended to suggest that full-pay may be advisable even in circumstances where a full scholarship has been offered elsewhere. However, I didn't convert that to a decided opinion on the two schools in question.

23.<<<arealist>>>
Go to MIT if you can handle the work and willing to work hard. Location, Peer group are major factors. Having said that, you cannot go wrong if you decide to go to Michigan. Visit both places and honestly ask yourself.

24.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
"And to be fair, we're not talking about full-rides just anywhere... but full-rides to top schools (say, top 50 on USNWR) outside the elite elite."

Well, I was saying that all full-pay MIT admits could get full rides to some school. Agree that there are far fewer full-rides to top 50 schools. As said, less than 200 total at Near-Ivies/Ivy-equivalents. Throw in Vandy, WashU, JHU, and it's still less than 300.

25.<<<juillet>>>
[quote]Did anyone say that though?[/quote]

Other people are <i>implying</i> that. With your comment (especially with the follow-up), @merc81, I didn't get the sense that you necessarily felt that way. But for example, I interpreted Happytimes2001's comment to mean that a full-ride to a place like Michigan isn't so special because "anyone at HYPSM could've gotten it and turned it down." Their sentence directly after that seems to imply, to me at least, that the OP should disregard the award for that reason - because MIT is so far and away better than Michigan that the money ceases to matter.

However, I think all that is irrelevant anyway. Let's assume for a second that every single student at MIT could've gotten a full ride to Michigan or an equivalent school and turned it down. So what? What bearing does that have on the OP's choice? The OP's choice, IMO, hinges on 1) whether Michigan will provide them with a high-quality education and get them to their career and educational goals - and whether they'll have the kind of college experience there they are looking for - and 2) whether MIT's offerings in those areas are worth an extra $250K + interest that they could spend on any number of other things (including, potentially, an MBA or other grad degree from MIT or an equivalent school).

Other undergrads' decisions about where they wanted to go to college don't really matter in this case, is my opinion.

26.<<<nw2this>>>
I agree that opportunities at MIT are incredible, but I'd still pick the full-ride at UMich over full-pay at MIT and I think those full rides are harder to get than admission to HYPSM.

27.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@nw2this: I agree. 200-300 full rides (not counting in-state students) at Ivy equivalents/near-Ivies total (depending on how you define them). Maybe stretching up to 400-500 if you become generous at defining what a near-Ivy is. About 7000 matriculants at HYPSM.
Most would not have the opportunity of a full-ride at a Near-Ivy/Ivy-equivalent. Many would have the opportunity of partial scholarships or even full-tuition scholarships from good (above the average flagship) schools or full-rides from average flagships or lower.

And if this is one of those special scholars programs at UMich, don't discount the opportunities afforded by those either.

28.<<<billcsho>>>
Full ride by merit at UMich is below 0.2% (near 0.1%) of admitted students, whereas the admission rate will be below 25% this year. So yes, it is much much more difficult than getting into HYPSM.

29.<<<Center>>>
I would never turn down MIT. It is head and shoulders above UMICH.

^@PurpleTitan why does it matter? We are talking about the prestige of the schools here----the perception of MIT vs UM in the eyes of lay people, not CC readers. Since we don't know what OP is majoring we can only go by the general reputation of schools and how much it will help in OP's career. Years from now employers will only know OP graduated from UM or MIT, not UM with full ride or MIT. And they will have no idea how selective UM full ride is even if you try to tell them. IMHO, money can always be replaced but college name can never be; once its lost its lost forever.

$280,000 is not easy to replace even for the upper middle and lower upper class (maybe the plutocrat class considers it to be pocket change, though). If the OP's parents would have trouble funding their retirement if they spent that on the OP's college, that should cause the OP to hesitate when there is a good full ride available.

33.<<<Much2learn>>>
To me, reasons to consider MIT include:
1. If you would still be a top student at MIT.
2. If you are heavily interested in Research.
3. If you are interested in CS/Tech.
4. If you are the kid who finally gets into a class where you are below the class average for the first time and that makes you happy that you have found your peeps.
5. If you have amazing focus/attention span.
6. You want to get involved in as much outside of class as possible.

34.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@jzducol:

Because more than a few of us on this thread have attended elite schools for undergrad and/or grad, are friends with or worked with MIT and/or UMich grads, have been on the interviewing end, understand various industries, and in general have a much better grasp as to how much prestige and opportunities at different schools matter in the real world (the hiring world in different industries) than most HS or college kids or lay people. We also understand how long we have to work to save up $260K after tax and what that type of money really means (roughly $2M by retirement, given conservative return assumptions). Also, employers will read resumes and know if he got one of those special named scholarships at UMich (he would certainly be free to state that he got the full ride to UMich and note how rare that is on is resume).

As you may have guessed, I actually consider that to be more impressive than a mere HYPSM degree.

Note that lay people don't hire. Hiring managers hire.

35.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@Much2learn: Actually, other than #4 and maybe #1, none of the other reasons are compelling arguments for MIT. You think a kid who is likely some prestigious named scholar and is one of the very few to get a full-ride at UMich won't get research opportunities, opportunities in CS/Tech, and opportunities to get very involved outside of class at UMich?

36.<<<paul2752>>>
Michigan hands down.

37.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Oh man. I completely missed this gem:

@jzducol:
"IMHO, money can always be replaced but college name can never be; once its lost its lost forever."

Right, because people die right after graduating from undergrad.

Have you ever heard of this thing called "grad school"?
And shocking as it may seem to you, there are actually people in this world who consider a full-ride recipient from an Ivy-equivalent or even Near-Ivy to be more impressive than one of many thousands of HYPSM grads coming in to the job market every year.

38.<<<DiotimaDM>>>
Michigan.

39.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
Actually, @Much2learn, you actually omitted the most compelling reason to maybe take MIT at full-pay over full-ride at UMich and that is cultural fit.

Even with #4, this kid will find peers among the top students at UMich. This isn't some average public with only 5%-10% of the student population entering with over a 30 ACT (and almost no one with a >33 ACT).

But if a kid would be miserable at a gigantic sports-crazed B10 school and would love a geeky very STEM-oriented student body, then that's a strong consideration. In this case, the OP seems to be leaning more towards UMich on the social aspects, however.

40.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
BTW, Larry Page went to UMich for undergrad. Sergey Brin went to UMD for undergrad (they both went to Stanford for grad). Going to giant publics highly-rated in CS (I believe both on full rides) didn't exactly derail their respective lives.

41.<<<SincererLove>>>
Wait, did OP do EA for both schools? MIT RD notification is pie day. I thought GT stamps notification was after pie day based on D's experience. Maybe U Michigan had a quicker timeline for their stamps finalists?

42.<<<milee30>>>
As wonderful as MIT's programs are, UMich not only has very strong programs but their alum network is one of the strongest in the country. And given how large the school is, the alum network is not only strong but large. Someone brought up a point about if the OP wants to get a venture funded, s/he would be better off with an MIT background... I'm not sure that's necessarily true. It's highly likely the UMich network would be helpful for funding, not something to be overlooked.

Much of this is a question about how much money a small difference is worth to an individual. Only OP knows his family's financial situation, but for most people with a financial situation with less than 9 figures in net worth, $250k is a substantial investment. Would MIT be "better" for some things if cost were equal? Sure. But arguing that the differential is worth $250k is a much tougher sell, especially since the alternative (UMich) is of such high quality.

43.<<<Mom2aphysicsgeek>>>
Stamps is more than a full ride scholarship. It offers a lot of perks and connections.

Caltech offers no merit scholarship for admission, same as MIT. They see no need to offer incentives to attend.

Whether MIT is worth the extra $260K? It depends on applicant family's finances and the answer would be different for different families.

45.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@1NJParent, Caltech use to offer 2 full-ride merit scholarships a year. They may have stopped.

Agree that it depends on how much money your parents have. If they have 8 figures in liquid assets, splurging on MIT isn't going to hurt much. But if that $260K is coming out of their retirement savings (as is the case with the OP), then spending that money is crazy when you have such a great alternative at zero cost.

46.<<<Much2learn>>>
@Purpletitan Based on what I know, I would choose Michigan. I think that 4 years is a long time and that school that is the best social fit is probably the best fit.

I also think that Michigan will be less demanding than MIT, but that may be good, because it can afford the OP with more time to get involved in research, being a TA, participating in coding clubs, adding a minor in math or stats, prepping for interviews, and other valuable bells and whistles.

However, each student is different. For example, if the OP is planning a CS major, top CS students are being offered compensation of over $200k/year directly out of college. In that case, $250k in education costs is a lot, but it is not insurmountable if the student believes that they will thrive better in the MIT environment.

47.<<<CA94309>>>
OP says
[quote]Socially I slightly prefer Michigan and academically I heavily prefer MIT's rigor.[/quote]
I am assuming that OP is taking about engineering here. The notion that the MIT engineering program is more rigorous than U Mich or other flagship publics such as GA Tech, UIUC, Berkeley, UT Austin etc, is false. You will get an excellent education at these universities and will have access to the same benefits of alumni networks etc, as that of an elite private such as MIT.

Go to U Mich. Return the 250k to your parents, maybe they can retire a few years earlier.

48.<<<Alexandre>>>
"the most compelling reason to maybe take MIT at full-pay over full-ride at UMich and that is cultural fit."

True PurpleTitan, but Collegethrows124 said he prefers Michigan socially in his opening post.

In general, in-state students and students who received hefty scholarships from Michigan will turn down HYPSM if they come from upper middle income and lower higher income families, where their parents' assets and income are too high to qualify for FA, but too low to justify spending $100k+ more on a college education than Michigan. In this case, we are not talking about $100k+, we are talking about $250k+. The choice is fairly clear.

Actually, there are some aspects of increased rigor at MIT, though not to the extreme of Caltech or Harvey Mudd. These include:

a. First semester calculus (18.01) is basically equivalent to two semesters of calculus at most other schools.
b. General education requirements are extensive. Many engineering majors may not like biology, but have to take it at MIT, unlike at other schools. The humanities, arts, and social studies requirements are heavier than at many other schools.

53.<<<Penn95>>>
@Collegethrows124 Depends on your family income and assets. If you guys are truly affluent and 260k is no biggie in the grand scheme of things, then sure go for MIT. If you are regular upper middle class where 260k is a big chunk of money for your family and would materially impact your family budget, parents retirement plan etc then I d say UMich. Sure MIT has a much stronger name and is the ne plus ultra for engineering but it is not worth all the extra money if it will create issues for your family finances. Especially since Umich is an excellent school with a top engineering program.

54.<<<1NJParent>>>

They are not extreme outliers. I'm surprised that you don't know that.

For some reason, the top schools are systematically not telling people how much their students are really being compensated. A graduates salary may be $110,000 say, but then there may be a significant $50k+ signing bonus and another $200k+ in equity that accrues over a few years, and other valuable perks on top of that. The schools are only publishing salaries. The total compensation is often very different than the salary.

56.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
That is a very rosy view of equity compensation. The big equity jackpots are not the common case for various reasons.

Regarding signing bonuses, those MIT course 6-3 grads found a median signing bonus of $15,000, not $50,000. Benefits obviously have value, but not $75,000 per year for the usual ones (medical, dental, disability, etc).

Of course, there are plenty of state school CS graduates working in many of the same places for similar pay and benefits as MIT CS graduates. Maybe less so in IB and MC, but is that the goal here?

57.<<<jzducol>>>
In case you haven't noticed, OP has not responded to any of the suggestions here. Its very likely none of the advice resonates with his situation. We know very little about OP's intended majors or family finance, we are not even certain if he was already accepted at both schools. But a few things were clear: OP's family is in 250K+ range (that's MIT full pay threshold) and OP would choose MIT if there were no price differential.
If OP is offered MIT EA and UM full ride he is such a high achiever that he is likely to have a mid career income 300K+ twenty years from now. For a person having a future earning $250k+/yr for 25+ years a $250k difference does not look so big. As @Much2learn suggested people who think MIT new grad being offered more than $200k total compension is out of the norm are probably out of touch with today's job market. I know a few MIT kids who have received multi-million dollar funding from VCs while still in college. There are possibilities that MIT undergrad experience may offer but they hardly exist at UM.

@PurpleTitan None of your business. It doesn't matter what our backgrounds are. The opinions are the same.
@jzducol You hit some great points. No one knows what you paid or if you won a scholarship or not. The top of the top cannot ever be compared to the top 20 or top 10. Perception and reputation open more doors than many people may every realize unless they attend one of the top programs. Not to mention going after research funds. The best college names open doors for 40 years (working lifetime). That is more than 250K for most people.

@ucbalumnus I know that you like to document things. However, in this case, I don't think you will find it. You have to know someone who is directly involved in the process. That is why people do not like to discuss it.

Try reaching out privately to people who are on the inside of what's happening with tech offers at MIT, Harvard, Carnegie, Berkeley, Stanford, Penn, Columbia, Cornell etc. Be sure to total compensation including signing bonuses, and equity stakes. Privately, they will tell you.

It may not be most, but it is many. I'm sharing a piece of valuable information that I have never discussed on cc: even once. Notice that no one in a position to know is disagreeing with my post? There is a reason for that.

Also, I said I would probably choose Michigan. It's a great school. My point is that while I think most students should choose Michigan, I can imagine a scenario where MIT could make sense for a particular student on a mission.

@billscho I understand that the signing bonus is one time. In the cases I am familiar with, it does not matter because of the salaries and size of the equity stake, but I allocated it across the vesting period of the equity to get an annual amount.

[quote]I am blessed to have a 250k college savings account but I think I want to go to grad school so saving money is very crucial.[/quote]
I'm a little confused here about why the cost of college has to pay off immediately. Presumably the parents put $250K in a 529 for the purposes of their kid spending it on education. If the OP wants to go to grad school in CS, that would be a fully funded program. No one pays for a CS grad degree at a good university. (Maybe they live cheaply, but that's OK for 20-somethings.)

Is there some indication in this thread that the parents are hurting for money? The part about the parent's retirement money seems to be the OP's misunderstanding that grad school in CS would be something his parents would pay for.

If the money is in a 529 for education, why not spend it on MIT?

@ucbalumnus "For the OP, a $280,000 bet on unverified claims of compensation that may still not be what most graduates from MIT will find?"

It may not be most, but it is many. I'm sharing a piece of valuable information that I have never discussed on cc: even once. Notice that no one in a position to know is disagreeing with my post? There is a reason for that.

Also, I said I would probably choose Michigan. It's a great school. My point is that while I think most students should choose Michigan, I can imagine a scenario where MIT could make sense for a particular student on a mission.

@billscho I understand that the signing bonus is one time. In the cases I am familiar with, it does not matter because of the salaries and size of the equity stake, but I allocated it across the vesting period of the equity to get an annual amount.

@Ynotgo:
"If the OP wants to go to grad school in CS, that would be a fully funded program."

PhD programs worth attending are funded.

Masters programs usually are not. MBA programs may have scholarships but full-rides to top MBA programs are almost non-existent.

As for the 529 money, yes it is budgeted for education, but parents can withdraw an amount equal to the scholarship penalty-free.
As I said, even if that money doesn't have to be used for the parents' retirement, after 40 years (when this kid retires), you can expect that amount to be around $2M in today's dollars.

Yes, fit matters (though it seems like the OP likes UMich more socially anyway), but from an ROI standpoint, this is a no-brainer.

"Try reaching out privately to people who are on the inside of what's happening with tech offers at MIT, Harvard, Carnegie, Berkeley, Stanford, Penn, Columbia, Cornell etc. Be sure to total compensation including signing bonuses, and equity stakes. Privately, they will tell you."

I am on the inside of making offers at tech companies and nobody makes $200k starting out of college. If somebody is telling you that, they're lying or they're using creative accounting to get that number. Offers start first and foremost with a budget a dept has, if a budget for a hiring group is say two people with a base compensation of $200,000 then each will get around $100,000. it's possible that someone gets $110,000 and the other $90,000 as some companies use the interview to set the starting salary. But a company is not going to spend $200,000 on one person and not hire a second. If you get two requisitions, you use them. Signing bonus of $50,000 is unheard of, but could happen to managers who need to sell their company.

Equity is where you can fudge the numbers, if a hiring manager has 2000 stock to give out, and each starting employee gets 1000 over four years, someone could calculate the value of the 250 shares, for simplicity say Google at 1000 and claim another $250,000 in salary, putting them at $350,000.

That being said, there is no difference in salaries in silicon valley tech between UM and MIT. They're considered equals, along with Stanford, Berkeley, CMU. And there are a lot of UM grads out here who hire a lot of UM grads. The UM alumni connection is stronger here than MIT. That's also because it's a larger school and I have run in to a lot more Michigan MBAs than MIT. And it's possible (gasp!) that a SJSU grad makes more than a Harvard grad if he or she can interview better and answer the technical questions better, which happens.

I can tell you for sure that in the Silicon Valley no one cares where you got you degree from. All employment offers are made after rigorous phone and onsite technical interviews. No one gets a pass because you are from some elite college. If you do well in the interview you get in otherwise you get the "sorry" email. There is no " Whole-istic" nonsense here. No you don't get more money and/or a hefty signing bonus just because you went to MIT or Stanford. I can also tell you where I work we have rejected a number of students from MIT and Stanford after the interview.

Starting pay for fresh undergrads are usually a fixed amount (with some signing bonus) irrespective of where you graduate from.

There is no wrong answer to OP's question. He has the money for MIT set aside in a college fund. On the other hand Michigan is a world-renowned university, if just a bit behind MIT in tech, and that college fund has many other possible uses.

There are a lot of valid reasons to pick MIT in this case, that isn't one of them.

If the OP is studying engineering, the difference is whether the OP will be staying up until 3am or 5am to complete problem sets. The average ACT is 33/34 vs 34/35. Both have vast engineering and CS resources. The OP would be paying $280K extra for a sliver of additional rigor. A Ph.D. program is likely to be funded anyway. Better to save the $280K for startup equity.

85.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@aboveaverage, people who hire don't actually look or care about the minutiae of rankings.
How it works is that they have a list of target schools they recruit at, and then it is up to the individual to impress during interviews. And both UMich and MIT would be a target school for any major software company.

Also, Ann Arbor is near Detroit in the sense that Princeton is near Philly.

@aboveaverage The real world is far more complicated than predicting success based on ranking lists. The Stamps Scholarship is a highly coveted award, speaks volumes in and of itself, and creates an entire additional network.
<url>https://www.stampsfoundation.org/2018/02/08/introducing-stamps-scholars-connect/</url>

FWIW, there are plenty of young people out there who are quite successful without having attended HYPMS. They may even work or attend grad school right alongside MIT grads with their lowly state school degree (of which UM does not even qualify since it is a powerhouse U.) MIT grads aren't like people on TV commercials walking around with a golden glow bc of their UG degree. ;) And the MIT degree does not guarantee automatic business success or grad school admissions. The person behind the degree matters, and a student who qualified as a Stamps Scholar has demonstrated significant accomplishments already.

As a high school student, your perspective is limited to what you hear from others that you believe. I hope the OP of this thread is in dialogue with his parents, not his peers, and that they ignore everything except what is best for their personal situation. This young person faces a win-win decision. There is no bad answer (unless the $250,000 does financially hurt his parents.)

87.<<<1NJParent>>>
I wouldn't pay $260k extra just for the prestige or the hope that you might earn more when you graduate. The most important ingredients in success are the people. MIT does offer on average higher quality faculty (and better access to the faculty) and a stronger student peer group than UMich, but the ultimate ingredient is you. How much do you need the advice and directions of the faculty and the pressure from your peer group to motivate yourself? If you don't, don't waste the money. Another factor to consider is whether you'll be in the top quartile at MIT (presumably you'll be in that quartile at UMich). If you're not, you won't likely have much better opportunities.

88.<<<Publisher>>>
Take the Michigan scholarship &amp; save the $260,000 if you did in fact get a "full ride" to Michigan (as opposed to a "full tuition" scholarship).

After graduation, if you get a job in Silicon Valley, then you can use the saved $260,000 to make a small down payment on a 400 square foot efficiency condo.

I haven't read this entire thread, but I want to remind OP and everyone, that the alternative to Michigan is taking some money from parents' retirement. I personally think this is a ridiculous thing to do. Your parents might be willing to offer it to you, but parents are willing to do all kinds of self-destructive things for their children. At some point, it is up to the kids to look out for their parents. You have nearly enough money saved in college savings account to pay for MIT. If you choose it over the full ride, you should commit to providing the rest on your own and not further burdening your parents. They have already done their part. They saved up an enormous sum for your education. Be grateful and give them a break.

92.<<<Lindagaf>>>
I'm actually amazed that you are even questioning this. It's not like you've been offered a full ride to Podunk U. You said you love the school too. Turning down a full ride at Michigan is folly, especially if attending MIT means taking money out of your parents savings. I'm trying to be nice here, but what on earth are you thinking?

I know MIT is harder to get in, but in the long run nobody will look at you resume and be disappointed by seeing Mich. Good luck in your decision!

@Theloniusmonk "I'm on the inside of making offers at tech companies and nobody makes $200k starting out of college."

All I can say is that you don't know what they don't know. You may not see it, but many top CS students from elite programs are making that much annually from day one. I've seen the written, signed offer letters.

96.<<<PurpleTitan>>>
@Much2learn &amp; @theloniusmonk, you guys are talking about different things.

@theloniusmonk isn't counting the signing bonus or equity.

97.<<<prezbucky>>>
There are few academic pursuits, if any, that you can do at MIT that you can't accomplish at Michigan.

Now, the support is probably a little bit better and most equivalent classes are smaller at MIT, but the differences probably are not huge in most cases -- certainly not worth $280k. That is an obscene amount of money, especially if grad school is on the horizon.

So unless you hate Michigan and are in love with MIT, Michigan is a pretty easy choice.

98.<<<theloniusmonk>>>
"All I can say is that you don't know what they don't know. You may not see it, but many top CS students from elite programs are making that much annually from day one. I've seen the written, signed offer letters."

I think as purpletitan posted, you're including signing bonus, equity and the projected yearly bonus to get that number. Maybe some of your examples are from outside silicon valley, where college reputation matters more. Even then you'd have to show that that was a causation between college and salary, not just a correlation.

BTW, Michigan is considered elite for CS or EECS (among other majors), my point is that where you got the undergrad does not factor into compensation in silicon valley CS jobs out of college. Once you get the interview, it's how you do there and if you fit with the culture.

99.<<<PengsPhils>>>
I have worked for a top CS company and know peers that have worked for every one of FAANG, Lyft/Uber, Airbnb, you name it, and the only way you get 200K starting is by working in finance with bonuses and the like or with equity offers being counted. My last job I worked side by side with new grads from both schools in this thread, and the range was usually 125K for the top tier, regardless of what school you come from.

While I'm here, another clear vote for Michigan - it's industry reputation is practically the same as MIT for CS.

100.<<<Much2learn>>>
@theloniusmonk
For example, say the equity vests over four years. I am adding the base salary, signing, and equity in the contract. The total over the four years has to be over $800k ($200k x 4 years). I am not adding any projected numbers. All potential raises, potential annual bonuses, additional equity etc. are assumed to be zero.

I think @purpletitan and @PengsPhils are pointing out that I am counting total compensation and you are thinking of salary. I agree with PengPhils that I have not seen a base salary of $200k+ for a CS major in tech. I have only seen a student get that much to go to an investment firm.

"Michigan is considered elite for CS or EECS (among other majors)."

Agreed. I don't know of a single engineering major that Michigan does not do well.

101.<<<billcsho>>>
@aboveaverage No one at UMich really care about Detroit although it is just 50 miles away. Most students would not go there or never been there throughout their 4 years at UMich. Many would go to Chicago or Toronto during the school breaks though, Ann Arbor has been ranked the best college town, the best place city to live in recent years.

102.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
An entry level job offer with equity compensation is not known to be that valuable at the time of offer. It is mainly by looking backward from a successful liquidity event that one can find people whose entry level jobs paid off in hundreds of thousands of dollars from the equity compensation. But at the time of offer, that cannot be known, and one cannot know if the company will hit the jackpot or (much more commonly) become worthless.

"#5 US news vs #28"

The US News ranking, like any ranking, uses a specific methodology that will favor one type of university over another type. Given its methodology, large, public, non-urban universities will be at a significant disadvantage, while smaller, private universities in urban areas tend to benefit from the methodology. While there are very few who would dispute MIT's ranking, there are not many in academic and corporate American that would agree with Michigan's ranking.

"#1 in the world Quacquarelli Symonds vs #30"

Last I checked, QS ranked Michigan #21. That's on a global scale...out of thousands of universities. For the record, Columbia, Penn and Duke were ranked #18, #19 and #21 (tied with Michigan) respectively. If anything, you are making an argument in favor of Michigan by referencing QS. Not that it matters since the QS ranking is as flawed as the US News ranking.

"#1 engineering undergraduate vs #6"

You are again making an argument in favor of Michigan. #1 vs #6 is hardly noteworthy, especially when #6 presents over a quarter of a million dollars in savings.

"Boston (with Harvard dual enroll an option) vs metro Detroit"

Metro Detroit is actually a nice area...in some ways nicer than the Boston area. But most Michigan students remain in Ann Arbor most of their time, so it's more of an Ann Arbor vs Cambridge scenario, and both are very nice and have much to offer. Also, Harvard and MIT complement each other in many ways. Harvard excels in the humanities and social sciences while MIT excels in Business, Engineering and the hard sciences. There are overlaps of course, as Harvard's core science departments (Bio, Chem, Math and Physics) are exceptional, and MIT is excellent at Econ and Political Science, but it makes sense to have cross registration between those two universities. Michigan, on the other hand, is so complete and strong across all disciplines, including Business, Engineering, the Social Sciences, the Humanities and the Sciences, that cross-registration is hardly needed. Engineers at Michigan can take their fill of humanities (LSA) and business (Ross) courses.

True. However, I am not trying to guess the future myself, I just counted it at its market value on the signing date with no discount or premium. That is what the market thinks it is worth currently.

I did make sure that the student understood that, as you say, it is possible that over time the stock may end up being worthless.

If the equity compensation was in stock options, then they should have a strike price the same as the market value as of the grant date. So their value (as they vest over time) is zero unless the stock price increases.

if the equity compensation was in restricted stock units that vest over time, then it seems unlikely that an already-publicly-traded company would offer $200,000 of such to an entry-level employee for the first job out of (any) college, barring something extremely exceptional that is unlikely to be college-dependent.

As a father whose child could be in the exact same situation, this has been a fascinating thread to read. My son also got the full ride Stamps scholarship to Michigan just recently and will find out this week if he gets accepted to MIT or not. Unlike the originator of this thread, we definitely don't have $250K available for college though! We could probably pay for around 2 years of Michigan in-state (although we wouldn't need to now) or 2 years of MIT with the way they charge for tuition on a sliding scale based on your household income.

While the decision will largely be my son's, my wife and I are obviously very partial to not having to pay anything. :-) We had been thinking many of the same things as the majority on this thread:

1) He could always get his masters at MIT (or Stanford, Cal Tech, etc) if he desires
2) The money saved could pay for his masters
3) Investing/saving that money could go towards getting started in life (e.g., car, house, getting married, etc)
4) Why incur student debt when you don't have to for something that is only incrementally better?

Also, I don't believe the original poster specified what he/she was planning to go in to. I believe this could make a huge difference as to what decision a kid makes. Our son plans to go into Aerospace Engineering. As many on here have already said, the rankings aren't necessarily all they are cracked up to be, but if you look at the US News &amp; World Report rankings for best undergrad aerospace engineering programs, MIT is unsurprisingly at the top. However, #2 on the list is Michigan (tied with Georgia Tech, another public university). These are both ranked higher than even Stanford and Cal Tech which come in at 4 and 5. Michigan is certainly no slouch in engineering, that's for sure. So, does it make sense to pay $150K (or more based on one's income) just to go to the #1 university over the #2? I can't see it. Also, he has visited both campuses and really likes both.

While maybe not a major consideration, another thing to possibly consider in favor of Michigan is that you can get credit for certain (not all) AP classes towards your degree. It's my understanding that with MIT you can get credit for certain AP classes as well, but that it doesn't mean you can graduate earlier, it just frees up another slot for you to take an elective.

The option would still have time value even if the strike is set at current market price. Its time value would depend on the time horizon for exercise of the option, any restrictions on its exercise, the volatility of its stock, interest rate, etc. If the "stock" is highly volatile (e.g. for a startup), the time value could be very high.

@tettnanger did write that "We could probably pay for around 2 years of Michigan in-state". Presumably, this is after the affect of in-state FA, if any. Of course, what a college defines as "full need" may not necessarily be the same as what the parents/student think they need to afford it.

"If the equity compensation was in stock options, then they should have a strike price the same as the market value as of the grant date. So their value (as they vest over time) is zero unless the stock price increases"

Fischer Black and Myron Scholes and the Nobel Prize Committee beg to differ.

"if the equity compensation was in restricted stock units that vest over time, then it seems unlikely that an already-publicly-traded company would offer $200,000 of such to an entry-level employee for the first job out of (any) college, "

The student received 5 offers, all from the usual suspects including 3 of the big 5. 2 of the student's offers (including one from a big 5) included equity of that magnitude.

"barring something extremely exceptional that is unlikely to be college-dependent."

Yes, this student is exceptional, but there are many exceptional students. This student lacks that one big thing you can point at, so no Olympic medal or Rhodes Scholarship, for example.

Is the outcome college dependent? I don't know. Every talented kid is a bit different. What they need to thrive is different. We never really know about the road not taken.

Again, I would choose Michigan based on the information presented. It is a great school. My point is simply that for certain particular exceptional students, who see MIT as a better fit, I can imagine a situation where MIT could be worth it if it. I have no reason to believe that is true for the OP of this thread though.

That's a no-brainer. Go to Michigan! A bachelors is still a bachelors whether it's MIT or Michigan. If you check professional job listings, you'll see that there is no distinction between schools, in fact the bachelors is just a minimum requirement. Experience is where the money and career grows. If you go for the scholarship at Michigan, you could still use part of that money for a master's degree, which would squash an MIT bachelors any day of the week.

The excerpt below is from Quora re: MIT vs topknotch public schools that are highly regarded for STEM. Nonetheless, I'd probably still go with the full ride from Michigan and MIT for grad school.

"The biggest issues that I might consider in the public vs private (school) analysis would be class sizes, professor-student interaction, and availability of opportunities outside of the classroom. This would include access to professors beyond posted office hours, availability of special programs, access to research opportunities, unique study abroad programs, funding for special programs/personal student projects/student clubs.

Then try to evaluate how much you would take advantage of these special programs at the more expensive school  how necessary vs that would be kind of nice but no big deal are they to you? Frankly if Baskins Robbins ice cream parlor offers 31 flavors but all you ever order is chocolate  then what difference do the rest of those 30 flavors make to you? They could be the most exotic flavors on the planet, but if all you ever order is chocolate, then so what?

MITs price tag includes this overwhelming multitude of opportunities  but if all you want is to take a basic set of CS classes (that nearly every good university offers) and get your degree as quickly and expediently as you can  well, why pay for the extras that youre never going to use? MIT is the ultra deluxe education package deal. Is that what you and your parents want, can afford (preferably without going into debt), and are willing to pay for  because youre really going to take advantage of all of these incredible opportunities?

Okay, so what are some of these extras?

For a kid who likes small instead of big, there are freshman learning communities of only 50 freshman and class sizes between 8 - 12 frosh, turning MIT into a STEM version of a LAC.; MISTI (internships all over the world, all expenses paid); IAP (a ton of fun, enriching, and/or educational things to do during the January term); externships (1 month internships during Jan term sponsored by MIT alumni); wanna do research with a professor? Word on the street is that it usually only takes on average 3 emails to snag one!; UROP (undergraduate research program); Super UROP (an extended and beefed up version of UROP); I dont know the dollar amount but pretty generous funding for the robotics clubs (Im guessing on the order of maybe $50,000?, but I really dont know so dont quote me on this one); ability to test out of required classes; personal one-on-one meetings with your advisor prior to registration every single semester; both general advisors for freshman who havent declared yet and major-specific advisors later on; rarely a problem getting classes in your major (although ironically you might have trouble getting less essential classes like PE, glass blowing and toy design); no problems graduating in 4 years (or at least not due to impacted majors anyway); able to take upper division classes and grad classes at will, even as a freshman; prerequisites that are guidelines not requirements; athletic coaches that get the fact that your course load is hard and that youre at MIT to be a student first and an athlete second; a ton of extracurriculars and clubs (although I suspect that most public schools also have this), M.Eng. program (get your Masters in Engineering in only 1 extra year instead of 2, offered only to MIT undergrads), taking classes with professors who wrote (or are writing anew) the textbook; phenomenal, out-of-this-world research going on in the labs; tons of support (free tutoring, mental health counseling, etc.); funding for dorm activities, outings, trips to help dorm bonding; a resident professor living in every dorm and a grad stud on every floor; and, last but by no means least, the amazingness of your fellow classmates, roommates, frat mates. I could go on and on.but my hand is tired of keyboarding now. Hopefully you get the picture.

Sorry for the novel. TL,DR  Its MIT, welcome to the firehose, baby!"
