I’ve gotten into Cabrini University’s Honors College and after financial aid and merit, the cost of attendance is practically free, less than $950/yr (no loans) - which is affordable for me. Although, I know Cabrini isn’t that great of a school, it was mainly a safety.
The costs of the other schools range between $6,000-$25,000/yr (loans required). Since I plan on going to medical school, my goal was to accumulate the least amount of debt as possible undergrad, to save up and go all out for med school.
Would going to Cabrini hold me back from getting into med school? Or should I attend a better school with more opportunities, and just deal with the debt?
Any feedback is welcomed/appreciated!! Thanks!

2.<<<ucbalumnus>>>
Big loans (which you cannot get without a cosigner) will hold you back.

3.<<<chercheur>>>
Get through your undergrad as debt-free as possible, and save any debt for medical school. The important thing is to do well in your undergrad and have a high GPA. Congrats on receiving a full ride!!!

4.<<<Elly710>>>
@ucbalumnus That was my thought as well, my concern is the quality of education that I would be getting at Cabrini

5.<<<Elly710>>>
@chercheur   Thanks! Would going to Cabrini count against me, when applying to med school. Would they rather see a flagship school in addition to a good GPA?

6.<<<chercheur>>>
I’m not in the medical field, but hopefully somebody who is will chime in.

7.<<<bopper>>>
If you want to go pre-med then think about:

The cheapest reasonable college so you/your parents can use the money for med school
The college needs to prepare you for MCATs but still allow you to get a good GPA
Access to volunteering opportunities (e.g., near a hospital)
Success in graduates getting into med school
Options if you don’t go to med school
Research Opportunities

How does Cabrini stack up against those things?

8.<<<Elly710>>>
@bopper Good point, Cabrini I think does well with 1-2, hospitals are about a 20-25 mins away though. Success of graduates getting into med school I don’t think is very high, as the regular 4 year grad rate is like 45-60%.

9.<<<Dolemite>>>
Cabrini may not offer all the opportunities like research that will help you get into Medical School straight out of college so you might plan to work on those other aspects after you finish your undergrad degree.  I have an acquaintance that graduated in '16 that is currently working in a lab and applying to Med School after attending a smaller college for undergrad.

10.<<<Elly710>>>
@Dolemite Another thought was to take courses over the summer each year to graduate in 3 years. And using the remaining year, as a gap year to work in labs/hospitals, do research, gained experience etc. Could this work?

11.<<<naviance>>>
I would try to shoot for one of the other options if they are reasonably priced. What is the net cost to you (including loans) for each of your current college options? If you list them, I think you can get some good feedback.

12.<<<Wilson98>>>
You can borrow about $6K a year yourself, or $27K total. I think any school on your list (maybe except for West Chester) that you can go to without borrowing more than that is worth considering. People may say to save the money and use it for medical school, but you and your parents don’t actually have any money. It’s a question of whether when you apply to medical school (with a potential further debt of $200K) you have a debt of $27K or zero. It could be that the advantages of a number of those schools will be worth the difference. And if you end up not going to medical school, at least you’d have a debt you could reasonably handle and a degree from a better school.
Borrowing $50K or $100K, for several reasons, is really not a good idea. If you don’t get into medical school, you might not be able to handle that much debt and the banks might go after your co-signer. Even if you do make it to medical school, it might take a couple of years to get in, and that much debt could make things very difficult.

13.<<<Dolemite>>>
I’m not sure accelerating your graduation from Cabrini will help much since it’s basically free.  What would be your Cost of Attendance for Temple?  Would AP credit help you graduate from there in 3 years?

14.<<<Elly710>>>
@Dolemite Since my FAFSA was selected for verification, getting financial aid has been taking longer, after running the net price calc, it’s estimated at $25,000, including scholarship, can’t know for sure.
The only AP credit I have is for Spanish & Italian, don’t think it will do me any good.

15.<<<Elly710>>>
@Wilson98 West Chester is my next least expensive one, haven’t gotten the financial aid back, but net price calc estimates around $6,000. Is that more than its worth?

16.<<<OhWhatsHerName>>>
My older sister went to a very small, very low tier school in Northern California for her undergrad. It took her along time, but through research, work with professors, and a lot of medical related experience she was accepted to Harvard Medical, as well as others.
My other sister is going to have to pay back the $200,000+ she collected from undergrad and grad school back for the rest of her life. If she did the debt free option she would’ve.
It’s not about the school, it’s what you do.

17.<<<twoinanddone>>>
What state do you live in?  If PA, can you use any of the PA state grants to help?

18.<<<Elly710>>>
@OhWhatsHerName Thanks for the insight!! Did your older sister go to med school straight out of undergrad, or did she take a few years and accumulate experience? With my choice of future career, I can’t really afford to take time between undergrad & med school–I’d be like 33 by the time I’m done.

19.<<<Elly710>>>
@twoinanddone  I do, the PA grants for me are only for about $5800, they are factored into the net price of every school.

20.<<<OhWhatsHerName>>>
@Elly710 She went straight to! This was a few years ago so perhaps it was easier then but I’m not sure. She did take I think 5 years in undergrad? But I think it’s doable.

21.<<<twoinanddone>>>
You’ll be 33 at some time whether you go directly to med school or take a few years between.  A friend of mine did a year’s masters program between undergrad and med school (retook the mCAT, took additional bio classes) and then she did 2 residencies (neuro and psych), got married, and yes, at some point she turned 33.
I think that $6k from state of PA is important.  I’d cross Vermont and UMass off the list, probably Drexel too as they’ll just be too expensive.

22.<<<OHMomof2>>>
Many students take a year (or more) before med school, to gain experience, volunteer, work, whatever.
It seems your least expensive options are $1k/yr vs $6k/yr?  So $4k vs $24k total?
I lean towards Cabrini.
Have  you read through its pre-health guide? https://www.cabrini.edu/globalassets/pdfs-website/sci/2017-18-sciencemajorshandbook-final_web.pdf

some good info there, and it appears they have a deal with Temple for some med fields (podiatry, dental, maybe more). They also have a PA program with Acadia and a pharm with TJU. 

The guide suggests a Bio major but that’s not necessary for pre-health, though you’ll take 2-4 each of Bio, Chem, Physics etc. because med school, at least, requires that.

23.<<<Elly710>>>
@twoinanddone Thanks for the insight!! I know I’ll be 33 at some point, I just want to finish school asap, so I can begin to work and pay off these loans that I’m going to have to take sooner or later–rather not prolong the inevitable. But I think you are right, Drexel is about $23,000/yr, although a good school, well beyond my means.

24.<<<Elly710>>>
@OHMomof2 Thanks for the link–I’ll make sure to read it!

25.<<<Pheebers>>>
I don’t know your stats, but was Dickinson a reach for you?  They meet full need, and may be affordable if you get in.
A few thousand dollars doesn’t make too much difference over four years, but it’s really hard to argue with free.  And what will get you into med school is effort more than anything else (translated into test scores, grades, and getting good jobs in the field).

26.<<<Hapworth>>>
Gosh, this is a tougher question than it appears, and I feel for you, OP.  Normally, I say take the full ride (or close to it) and take advantage of what you might see as a less desirable situation.  There are plenty of people, not just doctors but also faculty members, who started off at very modest schools.
That said, the ground is littered with the bones of hopeful pre-med students.  I am not trying to be negative, for indeed perhaps you have the determination, perseverance, and intelligence to successfully become a doctor.  At the same time, I remember very bright friends who were pre-med but ended up switching.  One switched to pre-law and is now a lawyer.  Another switched to dental and is now–wait for it!–a dentist!
I guess I’m saying that one of the things you should take into account is how happy you will be at Cabrini, personally and in terms of academics, if, God forbid, there’s a change of plans.  I feel like a hypocrite because normally I tell students not to get so hung up on the name or prestige of a place, and I still believe that, yet I’ve never heard of Cabrini, and I know just about every school in this country (all of the other schools on your list, including Marist and West Chester, I am familiar with).
But perhaps Cabrini is a hidden gem.  I had to Google it to be honest: a small Catholic LAC.  The good news is that it is small, which means you should be able to get the personalized attention that you need.  In general, LACs have much higher acceptance rates to medical schools than large universities.  The reasons should be obvious.  Instead of being in an intro Bio class with 100 students, you’ll be in smaller classes from the get-go.  Instead of hunting down a professor who doesn’t know you (because you’re one of many), you’ll be able to walk up to your professor at Cabrini for one-on-one help.  LACs don’t generate as much research as R1 universities, of course, but what research opportunities there are go to undergraduates since there are no graduate students to compete with.  I should note, however, that the higher rates for medical/professional/graduate school are mostly at selective LACs (not necessarily cutthroat but selective; a school like Beloit or Willamette or Dickinson would fit this description).
I sort of like the other options on your list more than Cabrini, though perhaps I am not following my own advice (caring more about name than opportunity).  Is it worth getting into debt?  For the most part, no.  However, moderate debt is the reality for most college students.  Is West Chester worth the extra 6K per year?  I’m not sure, but Dickinson might be, especially if, say, you change majors.  The Dickinson education would be top notch (it’s the strongest school on your list).
You do have tough choices, and I apologize that after all of this blabbering I haven’t really helped you much.  Best!

27.<<<Wilson98>>>
@Elly710 I don’t know anything about Cabrini or West Chester other than their rankings, which are pretty low. I doubt West Chester is worth $24,000 more than Cabrini.
I think some of the better schools, like Northeastern, UMass, UVM, Delaware, or Dickinson may be worth the $27K in loans over Cabrini. But it depends if they also require much from your family, and whether that’s an amount that would be hard for them to pay. If not, I’d consider them, depending on which you get into and what the aid is.

28.<<<Elly710>>>
@Pheebers Thanks for the insight!! Dickinson I don’t think is a reach for me, I’d consider it more of a match. Hopefully I do get in, and they can match my need!

29.<<<Elly710>>>
@Hapworth Thanks for the help!! I do see what you are saying about the risks I take should I want to switch. I honestly can’t see myself switching–as this is something I really desire, but you do bring up valid points! I will keep them in mind 

30.<<<Elly710>>>
@Wilson98 Thank you!! I see your point about Cabrini and West Chester not ranking highly–trust me I’ve taken that into consideration. The sad reality is that my family can’t really afford to take up $27k/yr loans, as our income is only a few $1,000 more than that. Dickinson I’m hoping will be able to meet my needs.

31.<<<Wien2NC>>>
@Elly710
Cabrini sounds cheaper than community college.  why not start there and see how it goes?  you could always transfer to West Chester (or somewhere else) after 2 years if you don’t think Cabrini will get you where you need to go.  that way you will get the exact same degree and save thousands of dollars in the process.

32.<<<OHMomof2>>>
You don’t need to decide until May 1, either - so there is time to see what Dickinson offers, and how you feel about it all then.

33.<<<Elly710>>>
@Wien2NC Good point!! I do see that as a viable option in the future, and your right, it could save me money–but just how much, if tuition may be hefty for those last 2 yrs? Will think about it!

34.<<<chercheur>>>
It seems like you’ve done a great job so far and already have 1 guaranteed full-ride. It will be interesting to see what the others offer. A big congratulations! You’re on your way! Keep us updated…

35.<<<Elly710>>>
@chercheur Thank you so much!! It is just a waiting game from here – I will certainly make sure to update 

36.<<<bamamom2021>>>
I live close to both West Chester and Cabrini in PA.  I have many friends who have graduate from both and gone on to have successful lives.  Granted the people I know have gone into business, nursing, music and teaching not pre-med. I do know a biology grad who works in pharm. research who is a WCU grad.
I realize that many posters don’t know much about the area or these schools so I feel I have something to share here. The OP probably knows all of this but maybe it will help with those giving advice.   West Chester is a very well regarded PA state directional.  The state flagships in PA (Penn State, Pitt, and Temple) are EXTREMELY pricey for the average Pennsylvania family and out of reach for all but the tippy top students of those with low income or income insecurity.  They do not provide many scholarships for in state students except for the cream of the crop and those are typically pretty lean. They do not meet need. Most people here on CC have heard about the problems with PA higher ed.
This leaves plenty of average excellent students studying at our directionals and WCU is one of the better, if not best, ones.  It is in an outstanding location.  It is suburban but 45 minutes from downtown Philadelphia and 30 minutes from downtown Wilmington, DE. Plenty to do on and around campus.  It is no longer a small suitcase school.  It is growing, has a lovely campus, great dorms, lots of job opportunities nearby, a large (and growing) regional hospital in town 2 miles from the campus that is affiliated with Penn.  More and more often neighbors and friends of top students are sending their children to WCU for 3 years (on scholarship) for a physics degree and then on to Penn State U. for 2 years for engineering degrees on a 3:2 program.  They have degrees from both (physics from WCU and then engineering from PSU) for half of the price. I have heard nothing but great things about the quality of teaching there.   OP should not feel like they are left with bad choices if WCU and Cabrini end up the only reasonable choices.
Drexel will likely be out of reach financiall and they are well known around here for not honoring their first year aide in subsequent years.  Plenty of coworkers and friends who have had to try and get back merit $ that they thought was for all 4 years but is actually not. Great school but something to you should watch for if it seems like you can make it work in year 1 - make sure to ask them about this. Temple has been generous in the past but does not seem to be in the position to extend as much aide as in the past and the state flagships do not meet need.  If you could make Temple work, I might take on some debt (no more than the federal student limit) because of its size and proximity to world class medical centers in Philly.  I do not think Uof D is worth the money and the price differential for OOS is likely huge.  If they give you lots of $ it may be in play but I would not pay extra for it over any of the other choices - including Cabrini.
Cabrini is a very small and very specialized little school.  Caring people and personal service.  I know many teachers who came through Cabrini and loved it. It does have the feel of a suitcase school and lots of part time students which can account for the low graduation rate. I do not have any other first hand knowledge of Cabrini.
Keep us updated as your offers come in. I am pulling for you.

37.<<<Elly710>>>
@bamamom2021 Thank you so much for the insight!! WCU for me is hand in hand with Cabrini, just a few thousand dollars more though. Drexel is about $18,150/yr, although it is a good school w/ great hospitals and such around, unfortunately its outside of my means. Temple I’m assuming will be about the same. I appreciate your perspective, I live in commuting distance of Cabrini and WCU so I am aware of the area, and it is nice around here!

38.<<<Elly710>>>
After running the net price calculator, Dickinson College for me would be about $6,080 which is decently affordable with minimal loans of $1,200-$2,500. Thoughts on this, I think a Dickinson education may prove to be better in the longer run, but I really don’t like the idea of taking out a loan?!

39.<<<happymomof1>>>
The over-all four year graduation rate at Cabrini (or elsewhere) is immaterial to you.  When you are comparing equally affordable prrograms, what matters are the first try MCAT scores for students who are still pre-med at MCAT-testing time, and the rates of first and second try med school admissions for students who are still pre-med at those points in time.

40.<<<Elly710>>>
@happymomof1 Thanks for the insight! I guess your right, when push comes to shove, my MCAT scores are what counts, my concern is will Cabrini prepare me enough, as another better/flagship schools will? I’ve looked into Carbine’s program and it seems decently good, who knows?!

41.<<<Pheebers>>>
My advice is to wait to see whether you get into Dickinson, and then see exactly what that will cost you.  It’s a terrific school, and in my opinion almost certainly worth a few thousand dollars – and it will give you a strong background and more options in case you change your mind about your first choice career.   We liked it enough that my own daughter applied there (ended up at nearby F&M but liked them both).
I’ve heard good things about West Chester too.  Bamamom’s post above is correct.  You’re going to have good options no matter what.

42.<<<Elly710>>>
@pheebers Thanks, I’m already waiting eagerly, I feel like my essay on “why us?” was very well written, so hopefully good news awaits!!

43.<<<Elly710>>>
Thank you guys for the feedback so far, it has really helped!! Again any more feedback or advice is appreciated/welcomed 

44.<<<MYOS1634>>>
If your family income is 30K or below, then Dickinson should be the same cost as WCU (or even cheaper) and would be the best choice. Its resources, small classes, excellent advising and support, would justify taking the federal loans for.
If you don’t get into Dickinson, then you can look at your choices, WCU v. Cabrini. I don’t think WCU is worth more than Cabrini, but I worry that Cabrini’s “target student” (3.0 in a CP curriculum, around 900 SAT) wouldn’t allow for the in-depth classes you can handle and that you need for med school. It’s also a 4-4 school, like WCU, meaning that professors teach a lot of classes and only have time to do research over the summer (with minimal research being conducted on campus during the year with students participating).
Wait till you have your financial aid package from Temple. Northeastern meets need but is need aware, meaning your financial need is taken into account when deciding admissions.

45.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 I see your points! I really do hope I get into Dickinson, but for now I will wait remaining financial aid packages. Thanks for the insight!!

46.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
If you do well at Cabrini and do well on the MCAT,   You can get into med school.

47.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^In Alabama terms, this is a student who could attend UA or Oakwood (O=Cabrini). That’s why I’m hesitant because Cabrini may hinder OP compared to other choices.

48.<<<Center>>>
Go for no cost:  GPA and MCAT is what matters.  The other stuff you can piece meal.  Medicine is not as lucrative as it used to be either depending on speciality.  Go Cabrini and shine…

49.<<<Elly710>>>
@mom2collegekids @Center @MYOS1634  My conflict is whether or not Cabrini can prepare me enough to do well on the MCAT. I’ll continue my research on the school, but I’m at a crossroads here.

50.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Don’t decide anything yet. It you get into Dickinson, there’s no doubt that’s where you should go because they meet need so that’ll be you best value.
Then you will have the other possibilities (like northeastern) that meet need.

51.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 I agree, Dickinson seems like the best most affordable option! Northeastern is a bit of a reach for me, but  we’ll wait and see who knows!

52.<<<Wilson98>>>
Regarding Dickinson: you mention the NPC came up with about $6000 cost. I had run it before for my son, and I just ran it again with made-up figures attempting to get a zero parental contribution. It did come out at about $6000, with a $3500 student loan (which would pay the direct costs not covered by scholarship or Pell grant) and about $2500 in student work to cover all other expenses.
For families with higher income, they normally ask for more like $5500 a year (which is why $27K total over four years would be the max you should do). If you can get into Dickinson and they offer a package with $1500 (as you mentioned) to $3500 in loans a year, no parent contribution, and a student work expectation of $2500, that would be a great deal and worth taking. Good luck!

53.<<<Jugulator20>>>
Although where you go to college is not of zero importance, successfully getting into med school is much more on your efforts than the school you attend. What counts is a competitive aspect in all respects (ie GPAs, MCAT, ECs, LoRs, PS, secondaries, interview). A little luck and applying broadly helps as well.
As to preparing for MCAT: when that time comes, you’ll probably have to get study materials and prep on you own or small group, or take formalized review course (eg Princeton Review). Premed reqs are not targeted to premed students. Premed reqs are courses open to anyone with an interest and who has completed course prereqs.

54.<<<Elly710>>>
@Wilson98 Thanks, I really do hope I can get in with a similar package you mentioned!

55.<<<Elly710>>>
@Jugulator20 Thanks for the insight! I guess its clear that if I go to Cabrini, a lot of study materials and prep will need to be sought out.

56.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^ that’s where I worry wrt Cabrini, because their first year courses in bio, physics, chemistry… will target their normal population, ie, kids who scored between 900-1000 on the sat (only 5% score in the 600+ bracket on EITHER math or English. 1030 is their top 25% threshold.) No way can the professors teach at the same level, pace, depth, as at a university where students arrive with multiple honors or AP courses and good critical thinking skills.
While being a successful pre-med depends on the student’s efforts, it’s difficult for a student to know what they don’t know wasn’t included in their courses. If OP chooses Cabrini s/he would have to find ways to mitigate the lack of course rigor. And if, like 75% freshmen would be doctors, op changes course… It’s not as easy as ‘take the full ride’.

57.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Completely agree!! This really is one of my main concerns, even though it’s less money, I fear the education will be subpar to the rigor I’m used to, and the quality I need.

58.<<<happymomof1>>>
If you are close enough to Cabrini to visit, go do that.  Meet with the pre-med advisor, and the faculty in the sciences.  Yes, the introductory-level courses might be a bit slower-moving than at other places, but the upper-level courses will get increasingly tougher, and I expect that the faculty members would very much like to have a chance to work with a focused, driven student like you.  Your opportunities for close work with the faculty, and with their pals at other institutions, should be pretty good.  If it happens that none of your other options pan out, you can make Cabrini work.

59.<<<Elly710>>>
@happymomof1 I do live relatively close, and will try to visit asap when time permits. I agree with your points, if all else fails, I’m sure with some added effort Cabrini may have to do.

60.<<<proudmama2016>>>
@Elly710, you have a great attitude and are so positive with your responses to suggestions. It’s a nice “bedside manner” that you’re displaying already! Some have suggested this in earlier posts, but perhaps consider doing two years at Cabrini, get straight As and be the top of the tops, then transfer to a more academic school. It might be worth it to do a little bit of debt for a degree from a school with a stronger health sciences curriculum (and professors) that better prepares you for med school. I believe the quality and rigor of academics of undergrad matters.  Best of luck and keep up the positive attitude!

61.<<<naviance>>>
Good luck to you! Take your time, collect your offers and compare them. Hopefully, one of your offers will hit the sweet spot!!! Let us know where you decide to go if you remember. We are all rooting for you.

62.<<<Elly710>>>
@proudmama2016 So sweet, thank you! I will surely consider this as an option, a degree from a stronger school will definitely help me in my future endeavors 

63.<<<Elly710>>>
@naviance Thanks! I’ll gladly keep this thread open to more advice, and to share an update in the future! I know in the coming months I’ll really sit down and holistically analyze my offers. I’m excited to see where this new road takes me!

64.<<<mom2collegekids>>>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
conflict is whether or not Cabrini can prepare me enough to do well on the MCAT. I’ll continue my research on the school, but I’m at a crossroads here.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
No school, NOT EVEN HARVARD, prepares students for the MCAT…    that is why you may be looking for something and risking big loans for something that does not exist.
Premed prereqs are just basic low level science courses that virtually every college will teach well enough for MCAT science needs.
What are your stats?  If they’re high enough, maybe a school like UAB would offer you lots of merit.  They’re still awarding.  At least at UAB there would be plenty of research and the school is very strong in sciences.  My son went to med school there.

65.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^ op is a lower income student who applied to full need schools. That’s why they should sit tight for now and wait till acceptances and financial aid packages are announced.

66.<<<Elly710>>>
@mom2collegekids Thank you, I see your point that there really is no one school that can prepare you for the MCAT. My stats are decent GPA UW 3.4  W 4.28  SAT 1250 (on the low side) several EC’s, AP/Honors courses etc. My only issue is that my family makes less than $30k after taxes, I’ve come to realize that OOS is not an option for me, as much as I wish I could afford it.

67.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 I’m going to have to agree, unfortunately I just can’t afford the loans. Heard back from UVM, financial aid as expected is very low, it will cost me about $29,763/yr, which nearly matches our income…I’ll continue to wait and hear back from all schools and remaining financial aid packages.

68.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Uvm doesn’t meet need. It was never going to be affordable. Dickinson and northeastern meet need, although for Northeastern they’d probably only admit if you’re URM as well as first gen. Dickinson is more likely if you’re first gen as it’s a criterion.
If push comes to shove, you can go to Cabrini, bank your federal loans,m (take the freshman and sophomore lines and put them in the bank, basically) and transfer to Temple for your last two years.
So, Cabrini is your safety. You’ve got a college for next year. Now you sit tight and wait till your full need colleges come back with an acceptance and a FA package.

69.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 If my mom went to college as an adult (38-42), not out of high school, does that still mean that I’m technically not first gen, aside from her no one else has gone to college?! Just curious…

70.<<<MYOS1634>>>
It’s not going but graduating from a 4-year college. It’s up to the college to decide whether that counts but typically if your mother graduated from a 4- year college you wouldn’t be first gen.

71.<<<prezbucky>>>
Cabrini U is accredited by the MSCHE, which is good. You want that top-level regional accreditation.
In terms of purely educational and cultural opportunities, I see UMass-Amherst as the star of your group. It is a member of the Five Colleges with Amherst, Smith, Mt Holyoke and Hampshire College(s). This means you could enjoy some of the courses and culture those other schools offer.
It’s a tough call – on the one hand you have no debt but a less known school and probably fewer research opportunities, and on the other hand you have schools that would leave you with some debt but are much better known and likely offer more research and other opportunities.
It’s impossible to say if Cabrini’s teaching and classroom dynamics are worse than they are at UMass (and the other Five Colleges, which feature small class sizes), Temple, UVM, UDel, Drexel. Look at class sizes, admit stats, and the percentage of full-time profs with terminal degrees in their fields, for a few clues regarding quality.
Cabrini is accredited, though, which is something at least.

72.<<<Elly710>>>
@prezbucky Thanks for the insight!! I’ve definitely kept in mind the importance of educational and cultural opportunities. I am still awaiting my financial aid package for UMass, but if it is anything like UVM I know I can’t afford it.

73.<<<MYOS1634>>>
UMass doesn’t meet need even instate. It’s not as stingy as UVM but it’s likely way too expensive. (Your list has a LOT of public OOS universities that don’t meet need  but what’s done is done). Perhaps Temple will come back with merit money and the fly-in-4 promise scholarship (you’d qualify, being lower income) but I’m guessing you’d get a similar package transferring from Cabrini, which would be cheaper.

74.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Yeah in hindsight I wish i would have applied to more colleges that meet need. I knew OOS would be more expensive, but didn’t think it would be by this much. Either way you live and you learn 

75.<<<OHMomof2>>>

@MYOS1634   It’s also a 4-4 school, like WCU, meaning that professors teach a lot of classes and only have time to do research over the summer (with minimal research being conducted on campus during the year with students participating).
[/quote]

What’s a 4-4 school? My D’s college’s profs primarily teach but she does research (paid) all year long.
@Elly710  - Dickinson sounds promising, if that works out you’ll have a great choice to add to Cabrini and WC!

76.<<<Elly710>>>
@OHMomof2 Don’t know what a 4-4 school is either?! But Yes! I have come to realize that Dickinson is a good bet, very happy I applied last minute!! Hopefully I can get in with good merit & aid!!

77.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 and to everyone: Just heard back from Temple University for my financial aid, must say I am a bit shocked. With federal loans taken into account, it will cost $19,188/yr. Without loans $24,688/yr… I knew Temple was going to be expensive, but not this expensive + it’s in state.

78.<<<kidzncatz>>>
@Elly710 Temple was my daughter’s first choice last year but she received no institutional financial aid from Temple.  Even with maximum Pell and state grants, the cost was too high for our $0 EFC family.  She asked for reconsideration of her financial aid award and never even received a reply.  She is now a freshman at West Chester.

79.<<<MYOS1634>>>
You didn’t even get Fly in four? Call/email your representative about it.

80.<<<Elly710>>>
@kidzncatz Thanks for the insight! I am also considering West Chester as a more affordable option. Spoke with financial aid office, and should receive aid decision early next month. How does your daughter like West Chester?!

81.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634  Was reading up on Fly in 4 and saw that they offer a $4,000/yr grant and other benefits, seems good but I think you have to make an enrollment deposit 1st and commit before you are considered for the program. I’ll try to get in touch with my rep soon.

82.<<<Elly710>>>
Just heard back from University of Delaware and its gonna be $27,185/yr, man these schools are expensive especially OOS!

83.<<<OHMomof2>>>
So far they seem to be following what was predicted here?
Dickinson still out there right?

84.<<<Elly710>>>
@OHMomof2 Yep! Should hear back around mid-march, hope I get in as it is one of my top contenders!

85.<<<Creekland>>>
Just caught up on this thread and adding in my hopes for Dickinson for you!  Otherwise, being another PA resident and working in a public high school, I can add that many students like West Chester and do fine.  It is often considered the best of our true state schools.
If you were my student, I’d have quite a bit of hesitation with Cabrini and would tell you to point blank ask them where recent graduates have gotten into med school and see if those options appealed to you.  Do NOT just ask for numbers/percentages.  Especially in a small school those are totally unreliable (they are in large schools too) and many schools consider Caribbean med schools to be just fine and dandy to include in their stats.  Not all pre-med students want to go to Caribbean med schools.  (Ditto with DO - they appeal to some, but not all and are often included in stats.)  If you like where other students have gone from Cabrini and are certain you have the dedication to equal their caliber, then the school should be fine.
ps  If Cabrini stays on your list, see if they will give you the names/contact info of recent successful students and contact them.  Most are incredibly willing to share what they did on their path to success.  Even if you go to West Chester, it can’t hurt to see if you can contact a recent grad or two who’s now a med school student.  Previous successful students are often the best with tips.

86.<<<Elly710>>>
@Creekland Thanks for the insight! I have the same reservations about Cabrini as well, I’m not very certain that it can offer the rigor and preparation that I need for Med School. That being said, affordability is a priority. I too have high hopes for Dickinson, based on what others have said they do meet need which is good! West Chester is still in the cards, I’ll update with their financial aid award once I get it…early March.

87.<<<kidzncatz>>>
@Elly710 I apologize for the delay in answering your question about West Chester.  Although at times my daughter still wishes she could have gone to Temple (or Pitt), I think West Chester is growing on her.  Her first semester wasn’t ideal, as she had several professors/instructors that weren’t very good.  She chose her classes/sections carefully for 2nd semester and seems to be happier with her courses.  She has joined the climbing club, which she really enjoys, as well as some other clubs.  She really likes the town of West Chester, which has a bustling downtown.  Not quite the city life she was craving, but very pleasant.   She is looking forward to living in an off-campus apartment next year, even though the traditional dorms are actually pretty nice and much less expensive than “affiliated housing”.  She wouldn’t even consider smaller schools, so she picked the PASSHE school that was the largest (and arguably the best).  I don’t know much about Cabrini so I can’t comment on whether it would be a better choice than West Chester.  I live close to Carlisle and took classes at Dickinson as a high school student back in the dark ages.  It is an excellent school and I hope you are admitted there.  If not, West Chester is a perfectly acceptable option.  Good luck with your decision.

88.<<<Elly710>>>
@kidzncatz No problem, thank you for the feedback! I really do have high hopes for Dickinson as well. If not West Chester is definitely in the cards, I have visited campus a few times since it’s driving distance and although its a smaller setting, I must say social life still seems very active. I’ll make sure to carefully pick my courses and join a few clubs while I’m there!

89.<<<juillet>>>
@OHMomof2 @Elly710 A 4/4 school refers to the teaching courseload of the professors. The first number refers to how many classes the teachers teach in the fall, and the second in the spring. Elite research universities may offer their professors a 2/2 or 2/1 load - meaning they teach two classes in the fall and one or two in the spring (or vice versa). Because they’re only teaching 3-4 classes a year, they have more time to do research - which makes up the bulk of their job anyway. (Sometimes, if they win a grant, they can even buy themselves out of the few classes they do teach, reducing their courseload even more. I knew some professors at Columbia who only taught 1 or 2 classes a year.)
A 4/4 load, on the other hand, is one of the heaviest courseloads a professor can have. They’re teaching four classes a semester, meaning that they don’t really have any time during the academic year to do research. 4/4 loads are usually seen at heavy teaching schools, regional publics, tuition-driven private colleges, etc.
However, elite liberal arts colleges may have professors who have 3/2 or even 2/2 loads. Dickinson, for example has a 3/2 load - five courses a year - which is somewhere in the middle. This is because top LACs expect professors to also do research that they can involve undergraduates in; it also gives them more time to do individual mentoring and advisement to their students. That’s how a professor can ‘primarily teach’ but still do research all year long. Very feasible for a professor at a top LAC or public honors/top regional college; not as feasible for a professor teaching eight classes a year at a public directional.



As to the dilemma: I am one of those folks that typically advises taking the full ride, but to a point. I think the OP’s worry that Cabrini may not adequately prepare them for the MCAT and other medical school stuff is not completely unwarranted, since as was mentioned, Cabrini is going to be targeting their courses towards the average to below-average students they mostly admit. I think the statement that ‘no school prepares their students for the MCAT’ is technically true but not true in spirit: since the MCAT tests material that you learn in your college science classes, it follows that if you have better quality/better taught science classes that you have a better chance of doing well on the MCAT. While I don’t always think higher-ranked/better-reputed schools teach better, I do think this is a different kind of comparison here.
But a more important point is one someone brought up on the first or second page that I really think bears repeating: A LARGE chunk of students who are pre-med before entering college are no longer pre-med by the time they graduate. Sometimes they find more interesting careers (both health and non-health); sometimes they can’t get into medical school; sometimes they just don’t like the pre-med curriculum, etc. While it’s true that you should try to keep your debt load low if you do intend on med school, I think no student should choose a school solely on the expectation that they will go. I tell students to ask themselves: if it turns out that you don’t go to med school after college (either not right away or never), and you end up doing something else, where would you like to go? Where would you like to have gone?
West Chester University is a pretty good school. I definitely agree with the advice to hold out for Dickinson - and also for Marist, which is also a great school. If it were me, I think I would pay the money to go to West Chester rather than attending Cabrini. But I agree that you should visit, sit in on some classes, talk to some professors, really soak it in.
I’m not surprised that Temple and the OOS publics are too expensive; public universities rarely give much aid to non-resident students, and someone else has already discussed the issue with PA’s state-related universities. Drexel isn’t known for great financial aid so that one’s a toss-up and the odds are not in our favor.

90.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^ I wish I could like this post more than once. Very comprehensive and hits everything you need to know.
Worth reading more several times.

91.<<<Elly710>>>
@juillet Thank you so much for this, very helpful! I have considered the thought of other careers/interests should the idea/want of med school go south. West Chester is certainly an option on the table that I am greatly considering, I’ll update what my financial aid decision is when it arrives (early March). Drexel came out to about $18,148/yr far from affordable for me so I’ve tossed that option. I continue to hope for acceptance with good aid from Dickinson (my top choice) and Marist as well. For now I guess it’s a waiting game.

92.<<<Elly710>>>
West Chester University Financial Aid Update :
$1,454.66/yr without loans
$254.55/yr assuming I win $1,200 scholarship from WCU which I qualify for b/c of where I live and need based
$-1671.34/yr essentially $0/yr using all 6 AP credit in language (Italian&Spanish) or $-681.45/yr using 3 AP credit (either language)
-I’m very pleased with the outcome, as this makes West Chester very affordable for me! And still a top contender!
-I feel like I should know this, but I was wondering how AP credit works throughout college, is it good for all 4 years or just freshman year? Or once you use it up taking a course equivalent its gone?

93.<<<OHMomof2>>>
Yay congratulations Elly!!   Two super affordable choices now, right?
Here’s WC’s AP credit info: https://www.wcupa.edu/registrar/documents/Advanced%20Placement%20Examination.pdf

[quote]
is it good for all 4 years or just freshman year? Or once you use it up taking a course equivalent its gone?
[/quote]

It’s good for whatever classes you choose to use it for. Usually that evaluation is done before you enroll, or early in the first year.

94.<<<Elly710>>>
@OHMomof2 Thank you!! Yep that makes 2 affordable offers! Good to know that I can put the credit to use where I need it. As of now I just have Dickinson, Marist, and Northeastern to wait for, I’m glad knowing I have a good safety  to go to.

95.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Terrific!!! Okay so now it’s West Chester v. The others. 
You take about 15-16 credits each semester. Total, about 120 credits.
Typically, AP credits match first semester or first year classes. So, you may get 4 credits for AP Calculus AB that match calculus 1, and you don’t have to take calculus 1. For AP foreign language you may get 3 credits and placement in 202 level (which would count another gen Ed). So, AP credits allow you to have some gen Ed credits at the beginning so that you can take a lighter load one semester (such as when you take orgo) and still be on time to graduate, or save space Jr/Sr year for more advanced classes since you basically skipped ahead on sequences.
What would you major in and what would you ask credit for?

96.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Thanks for the explanation, helpful! My major at WCU would be Biology: Cell & Molecular BS, I’m not sure just yet what I’ll use the credit for, but most likely something that would be beneficial to “take out of the equation” early so to speak.

97.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Beware of biology: it’s the major with the lowest ROI at this point due to an oversupply of biology majors who couldn’t get into med school.
Don’t change anything but think about it before Fall registration. In particular, perhaps look at the 4- year plans for Biochemistry and Forensic Chemistry?

98.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Good to know! I had a small inkling about this earlier, when speaking to a rep she said that this major was the best pre-med track, but what if I don’t end up going is the real question. I will definitely take this into consideration when thinking about alternative routes in college should med school fall through. Biochemistry in fact was my 2nd major of choice when applying.

99.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Yes among their different biology major this is the best.
You can major in anything and be premed. Med schools want you to handle the pre-reqs and your major and advanced science classes of your choice with As (or at least grades reflecting top 20%), show leadership and compassion through a variety of contacts with people through shadowing, clinics, volunteering, etc. If you can be a Spanish and Portuguese double major and do all of the above, you’re good. 
Btw, if you read AFrenchie36’’ s tumbler you saw he spearheaded RAM in PA, that’s the kind of things you’d need to participate in. I’m sure you can contact him to ask questions.

100.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Sounds like Biochemistry is the way to go here, I’ll keep this in mind. I was thinking in minoring in foreign language/a specific language as that’s something i really enjoy. I’ll make sure to take a look at AFrenchie36’s tumblr too!

101.<<<Cookies510>>>
Happy to hear you have another affordable option.  I’m from the Philadelphia area and West Chester was always well respected for its science/pre-med programs.  My Penn doctor (who is always ranked among the top docs) was a West Chester grad and went to Penn for med school (after starting out as a music major).  Another high school friend went to West Chester, then Georgetown Medical School.  He is now a well-respected cardiologist.

102.<<<Elly710>>>
@Cookies510 Thank you! Nice to hear of some success stories about those who have gone to West Chester for their undergrad. Assuming I go on to med school, I really do hope I can get into a top medical school like Penn or Georgetown. Sounds like with some effort and handwork, West Chester can really prepare you for that.

103.<<<Elly710>>>
Time for another update!:
-So I was rejected from Northeastern, no surprise there…
-Waitlisted from both Dickinson and Marist
I was really hoping to get into Dickinson, as it’s my #1 school and if accepted I would attend. I am planning on emailing a letter of continued interest stating the previous and touching upon a new month long internship I will be doing at a well respected hospital near by.
For right now, West Chester is where I’ll be attending, I haven’t submitted my deposit yet as Dickinson releases waitlist decision late April/early May–therefore I’ll hold out as much as possible. They accepted 35 students off the waitlist last year–not many I know…
Any suggestions/tips for increasing my chances at being accepted?!

104.<<<MYOS1634>>>
I’m very sorry about the WL from Dickinson. Do send that Letter of Continued Interest with the updates (1st seemster grade report, and 3rd quarter grades, recommendation letter from supervisor at internship or job, etc.) Do stateclearly that if accepted and affordable, you will attend since it is your #1 school.
As for West Chester, start exploring Living Learning communities to see whether there’s a deadline, same thing about honors progam.

105.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 I start my internship in early May, so I won’t have a letter from my supervisor ready in time, I will speak with my counselor about sending in my third quarter grades. For now, I’ll continue to look into the honors program, I’ll also be commuting to West Chester, so there will be no need for housing all four years.

106.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Ok.
The PASSHE schools’ honors programs have a really cool benefit (in addition to the usual) in that each year they select 2 students who can go study abroad for totally FREE over the summer. The places rotate in order to match a variety of majors. APPLY ASAP (especially since the quicker you apply, the better the odds of scholarships)

https://www.wcupa.edu/viceProvost/honorsCollege/internationalTravel.aspx
Contact the WCU office of Financial Aid (attention Ms. Barbara Fenton) to indicate you’re a candidate for the Honors College (list stats) but can’t afford to live on campus, and hte Honors College has recommended you email her.

107.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 My stats are just under the cut off for the honors college (SAT 1270 / UW GPA 3.5) at 1250 and 3.4 respectively… I’ll try to see if I can apply either way though. Is Barbara Fenton the one who I contact at the Financial Aid Office and for the honors college application?
Living on campus is not really a must for me in this situation, would be nice, but right now my COA is next to nothing, and I wouldn’t want to add $1,000+ just to dorm. I live about 20mins away from campus as is.

108.<<<MYOS1634>>>
I know but honors really helps since Passhe schools have lower funding so the honors program offsets this (since they have extra funding). Housing is just one benefit - the other perks, especially close relationship with professors, advising, the supportive cohort would all help.
What’s your weighted GPA? What AP classes have you taken? How many honors (#)?
Match your interests with what the honors program offers, cite something you’re genuinely excited about (book, idea…) Any extenuating circumstances (could be having to work 20h a week, family suffering a setback…)

109.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Makes sense, I’ll definitely use specific examples/cite from their program and apply, couldn’t hurt 
-W GPA is 4.28
-AP Psych, AP Spanish 4&5 (5), AP Italian (5), AP Chemistry… the 5’s are what I received on the tests
-Don’t remember the exact number but around 18+ honors classes

110.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Definitely list your weighted GPA too, nulber of honors classes, and each AP class with the exmaen  result, your foreign language study and exams (are you a heritage speaker? Do you love languages and if so why/how do you demonstrate it and how would being in the honors college help that live if learning? So you read in Spanish or Italian, watch films in the original language, hope to learn one more language…?),  explain you’d like to major or minor in Spanish (which is 100%legir for a pre-med) among with a (biochemistry, neuroscience, bioinformatics…) major…

111.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Will do! I was planning on minoring in foreign language, Spanish or Italian (probably Spanish). I honestly just love languages, I can speak, read, and write in them both. I’m currently taking French 1, just for the heck of it too. I’ll touch upon my passion for languages and the such within the application, hopefully this will give me a good boost 

112.<<<Elly710>>>
I’m wrapping up my letter of continued interest to Dickinson, and I was wondering if it would be a good idea to day:
“Dickinson is still my top choice for a great affordable education, and if accepted off the waitlist, I would happily attend without hesitation.”
Or remove the word affordable? How do I go about saying that I would love to attend, but since money is a big constraint for me, it has to be affordable?

113.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Just say “Dickinson is still my top choice and if accepted off the waitlist, I will happily attend without hesitation”.

114.<<<chercheur>>>
Would asking for an interview help Elly710?

115.<<<MYOS1634>>>
^Not at this point, alas.

116.<<<chercheur>>>
Good luck, @Elly710! A lot of us are following and pulling for you!
Edit: @MYOS1634 - You’re a great mentor!

117.<<<Elly710>>>
@chercheur Thank you so much! 

118.<<<MYOS1634>>>
I am no longer getting the “@…” comments so I’ll check my settings. Anyway…@chercheur  thank you!

119.<<<RandyErika>>>
In case it isn’t already known, the West Chester honors program is “comprised of students with outstanding achievement in scholarship, leadership, and community service” - with a major focus on leadership and service. So it’s not just for smart kids and is very competitive. One of my twin Ds was invited to apply for the honors program, but she respectfully declined as she’s just not a confident leader yet (and WCU is just too close to home at 7 minutes away).
The other twin D was accepted to Dickinson but is unlikely to attend (small amount of merit doesn’t justify the cost over her alternatives). After reading this entire thread I wish we could offer you her acceptance - your good natured enthusiasm is refreshing. Good luck!

120.<<<mommdc>>>
As a student with EFC of $0 you got a tough time in PA. You can get a Pell Grant of about $6,000 and a state grant of about $3,000-4,000 depending on school.
Sounds like Cabrini is giving you need based institutional aid as well and/or merit, which is very generous.
Take the generous offer.
Your biology, chemistry and organic chemistry classes will be difficult.
Cabrini is one of the member colleges of the SEA-PHAGES program.
https://seaphages.org/
Get involved in that, and you can be doing hands on research as a freshman biology student.
That will probably lead to other opportunities.

121.<<<mommdc>>>
The 75 percentile SAT score is not really that different between West Chester and Cabrini.
I think a smaller school might be better for pre-med. More personal attention from professors, maybe smaller class sizes, honors helps.
Having about $9,000 in grants is not that much if WCU costs over $20k. Maybe a bit less if you got merit.
Cabrini is giving some merit and need based aid as well. They are being very generous.
The other schools, Drexel and OOS publics, probably won’t be affordable.
Dickinson might, and it is a good choice.

122.<<<mommdc>>>
I see that you got wait listed at Dickinson, I hope your email will help!
West Chester sounds like a great option for you too. Hopefully honors comes through for you.
Dorming would be helpful, if you can swing it financially.
Don’t forget to apply to local scholarships to help with books and other expenses, if even just for the first year.

123.<<<artloversplus>>>
OP
I have read most of this thread and @MYOS1634 gave you such good advises that I have little to add. But since your interest is premed and I come from the premed section of CC I shall give you some points about premed.
Unless you have extensive volunteering/shadowing in the medical field, most of the HS students don’t know what medicine or physician is or how to get to that status, therefore 75% of the entering college freshman  drop out of premed for one reason or the other before they hand in the application for med school. The reasons of drop out could be academic but they also could be non-academic related. Medicine career is not for everyone and you should pick a school that has premed but also has a variety of other subjects that could be interest to you. In other words, you should not use premed as a selection criteria for your college decision. To me WCU is a larger school and it is better known in PA community. WCU graduates has more employment opportunity if premed does not work out.
Based on you being waitlisted in Dickenson and Marist, I have an incline that medicine may not fit you. Unless you can excel in the college getting mostly As, your chances with medicine is not high. From this point on for you to get a fully board certified physician with specialty may take as much as 16 years and in that long period, other than you might pay very little in the Undergraduate stage, the medical schools are very costly and you have to borrow all the way. It is a little scary unless you absolutely committed. Moreover, there are millions of tests, standardized or otherwise are ahead of you. One slip and you are out of the race. I also see that your AP classes are mostly non-science and unless you have a high aptitude in science and biology, you will have problem in those weedout classes.
All in all, you should choose a larger school with more options other than premed or biology. Biology is the worst major to find a job if you cannot get into a health care professional school afterwards.

124.<<<Elly710>>>
@artloversplus Thank you for your advice! I was planning on switching my major at WCU from molecular biology to biochemistry, to give me a bit more freedom, should I decide med school is not for me. I will also be doing a month long internship in May, shadowing several physicians in pediatrics, maternity, geriatrics, and psychiatric wards at a well respected hospital in PA. I hope this will give me a bit of insight.
I see where you are coming from, I know my SAT scores and grades are not that great…partly due to deeper issues, but I’m certain I can pull through and really commit myself to getting top grades and doing the best I can. I feel with a decent sized school (on the smaller end), that is more student focused where you can get personal with teachers, will greatly benefit me. A fresh start couldn’t hurt. I honestly can’t see myself doing anything else.  :-?
Although I feel Dickinson is really the best choice for me, WCU is not too far behind. I am planning on emailing the LOCI to Dickinson on Monday since its a work day…and hopefully that will help me get accepted! Should I send that directly to the Dean of Admissions, or to the Undergrad Admissions office?!
I realize that this will be a very steep and slippery mountain to climb, but I’m willing to try my best!

125.<<<Elly710>>>
I’m about to send in my LOCI for Dickinson, on their website their is an email for the Dean of Admissions personally, and a email for undergraduate admissions. Should I email the Dean or Admissions?

126.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Sure, as long as your LOCI is very polite.

127.<<<Elly710>>>
I called admissions this morning and they told me to email it to their office and it would later be placed into my file. All good, now it’s just fingers crossed! :)&gt;-

128.<<<chercheur>>>
Good luck!

129.<<<Cookies510>>>
Good luck!  I’ve been following this thread & am hoping for the best for you.

130.<<<Hapworth>>>
Collegedata dot com shows that Dickinson had a waitlist of 230+ and ultimately took 30 off the list (not sure which year this was for).  Keep in mind that some years can be better than others in terms of the WL.  Also note that there is no order to the waitlist.  In general, the college will turn to the WL to accept students who best fill holes.  For instance, if the entering class is to heavily skewed toward women, a greater percentage of men might be chosen.  If a school is trying to boost its diversity figures, it might show a preference for URMs.  Diversity also means economic diversity, so that could mean trying to add a few students from lower-income families.
Finally, no one gets in off the waitlist without communicating with the admissions office that Dickinson remains that student’s top choice and that she/he is interested in attending.  So figure that there will be some students who wrongly assume that by just accepting the WL that they are in the mix to come off the list.  Nope.
Best of luck.

131.<<<Creekland>>>
@Elly710  Don’t be discouraged ahead of time for the medical field.  I work in PA (public high school) and have literally seen thousands of students over the past 19 years.  Those who do well heading toward med school are those with a good work ethic (not choosing to major or minor in partying, but still making time to enjoy themselves with various ECs in college), not necessarily those with the highest scores on the SAT/ACT in high school (though low grades definitely aren’t a good sign).
In an average public school (like the one I work at), there is generally only a “typical” level students get education-wise.  An SAT score &gt; 1200 is often considered a great score among our top students - most of whom will attend various state schools - those college bound anyway.  When these students attend reach schools, it can be tough for them to compete because “all” the students there have a deeper foundation than the one they were exposed to (already having great AP classes or similar), but at state schools (or similar level - state/public doesn’t really make a difference in level of school) more students are entering at a similar foundational level.  Our top students with a work ethic still succeed and go on to med school if they continue to desire it (some definitely change their minds along the way).
It is definitely a good idea to shadow medical folks and volunteer at places like Hospice to get a feel for the real job.  That’s true of any job IMO, but med school requires a bit of a commitment, so is worth the effort to be sure.
I wish you the best on your journey.

@Hapworth Yep you are right, in my waitlist letter Dickinson said they only admitted 35 students off the waitlist, out of presumably 150+. I know my chances with that are slim, I sent in my LOCI yesterday, is there anything else I can do at this point?! Call, visit campus?
I’m hoping what they need is diversity and economic diversity, because that’s pretty much where I stand!

133.<<<Elly710>>>
@Creekland Thank you for the words of encouragement, they really mean a lot!
I’m well aware that my SAT scores and high school grades although not horrible, weren’t as good as they could have been. I am definitely a believer in a fresh start. I plan to change my work ethic and invest more time into my grades, while also enjoying myself via different EC’s. This 4 week internship I’m doing at Bryn Mawr Hospital beginning early May, will definitly give me a new understanding to patient care and medical practice, while serving to reinforce my passion for helping others. I look forward to making the most of it!

If you want to work in medicine, you will be able to do pretty much what a doctor does, by following the nurse practitioner or physician assistant track.  I had classmates in medical school who honestly weren’t that bright, but had been very hard working high achieving students at mediocre colleges.  They go into med school, got through, and became doctors.  But they were VERY hard working.
Becoming a nurse practitioner or physician assistant takes about a tenth of the actual training hours, when you factor in that med school and residency are usually 90 hour/week training schedules.

Good points above! I toured UT Austin and Rice with my son last week and at both places our tour guide started out premed and has switched so that is definitely common… I am married to a physician, and both my sister and sister-in-law are physicians. I would agree that work ethic is key! I did not figure that out until more than halfway through my undergraduate. The best advice I’ve given my children I would give to you. The easiest way to do well in college is to not skip class! There’s nothing better than sitting in the classroom, hearing what is being taught, and writing it down yourself.  Second, treat your weekday like a job. It is very easy to waste time in the middle of the day doing nothing. I discovered that if I went to the library between classes instead of to my dorm or apartment, it was much much easier to complete all my work and have a social life. Finally, you do not have to declare a difficult science major at most schools to be premed.   Depending on the rigor of your college, however, it may give you a better chance to get into med school.  My sister chose psychology because she needed a break after fulfilling the grueling premed curriculum.    At her college, psychology was one of the least rigorous. She did quite well, and got into the medical school of her choice. Good luck to you!

So it’s coming down to the nitty gritty, many of my friends know exactly where they are going…but I’m still on the fence. I’m leaning towards West Chester, but I have just received another scholarship from Cabrini of $8,000 for practically no reason. (I think they desperately want me  )
Cabrini already costs $&lt;0 (I’m in the negative right now) including AP credit along the way. With $8000, I will be able to live at Cabrini for about $3,000-$3,500/yr. This changes the game, $3,000 is do able for our family. If I decide to stay at home, it’ll cost $-5,000/yr
I’m taking a second look at Cabrini, b/c perhaps given its lower stats of accepted/enrolled students, getting a competitive GPA for med school will be easier. With easier classes and less competition this might be possible. I’d also be in the Honors College/Dorm here as well.
That being said, I’m well aware that research/med opportunities are pretty limited, and that the MCAT prep there will be subpar.
Thoughts?!

Go spend an overnight.
Ask whether you can stay in the Honors dorm, attend honors and science classes, visit the labs, meet with professors, talk with students.
Ask if Honors students can cross register at other area colleges for variety. Whether study abroad would be funded. Whether they offer Honors Biology, Honors Chemistry, Honors Physics, Honors Calculus, Honors Statistics, beside Honors English/religion/philosophy. If you could start in a “Research Biology” or “Research chemistry” class right away in the Fall.
Email the professors in the science departments. Look up their latest research. Ask where they’ve been first or second authors, if undergraduates can be third or fourth authors if they participate in labs. (Ask how many classes a semester they teach and how many “research” classes they supervise).
As far as I can tell there aren’t any Honors Science classes and only ONE chemistry class above organic chemistry per semester. You can take “research chemistry”, which is basically an independent study for credit. Biology has a couple more classes. NO biochemistry whatsoever which would be a problem for premeds.
The classes are small - even intro to biology would have about 30 students. But… it’s more like a community college, offering the basics for your first 2 years.
Keep in mind that “Honors” at Cabrini means 1100 SAT or 22 ACT with a college prep (non honors) 3.5 GPA. I don’t remember how that compares to your stats exactly but I seem to recall yours were much higher than that.
An option may be to attend Cabrini for 2 years, living on campus, taking all the possible classes you can, getting involved in research (if some is being done - and it seems like there’d be little due to the fact the professors have such an heavy teaching load)… then transfer to West Chester for the last 2 years. It’d be hard because you’d need to establish yourself at West Chester, especially with professors, and you’d probably have to apply to med school at the end of your senior year, doing a glide year (research?) However you’d avoid the large, weedout classes at West Chester.
BTW what happened to Marist? The thread is long and I forget but I thought they were in the running?

138.<<<kidzncatz>>>
If you haven’t already done so, you might want to reach out to the Dean of Natural Sciences and Allied Health at Cabrini and ask any questions you may have (such as number of students who applied to med. school and their success or lack thereof with admissions).  I think it would be great if you could afford to live on campus instead of commuting, but that’s a personal preference of mine.  I had previously answered your question about West Chester, since my daughter is a freshman there, but I also have a true story (granted, only one data point) regarding a student who decided to go with the less expensive option.
My adult son’s best friend from high school, an above average but not outstanding student in high school, went to Shippensburg (as you may know, a school not particularly known for excellence in the sciences) because he didn’t want his parents to have to pay a lot more for his first choice (private) college. He was a top chemistry student at Ship, where his professors loved him, and went on to Princeton for his PhD. He is now a college professor at a well-known university in California.
In your case, of course, the choice is the reverse, with the private school being the less expensive,
Best of luck with your decision.  I feel sure you will be successful no matter which school you choose.

139.<<<mommdc>>>
You will be preparing for the MCAT, there are prep books and programs out there.
I think you should thoroughly research your opportunities at Cabrini, it’s great that they gave you an extra scholarship!

140.<<<Creekland>>>
The one thing I’d put at the top of my list is asking how recent grads have done with med school applications.  Where have they gone (specifically)?  If you like what you see and otherwise enjoy the campus, go there and have fun.  If not, I’d probably stick with West Chester… IF you are certain you want to become a doctor.

141.<<<mommdc>>>
Cabrini has some articulation agreements with professional programs, which might be of interest if you might end up choosing PA or pharmacy or DPT over med school.

My concern is the lack of advanced science classes
ETA: found a biochemistry sequence (Biochemistry I&II) and a possible concurrent class for premeds, Biochemistry of cancer.
I do think Cabrini would be fine for 2 years then transfer somewhere, as long as you’re allowed to supplement your classes with the research science credit and go as far as you can/take as many classes are you can. Classes for students whose scores are so low aren’t going to really make the cut in terms of preparation so you’ll need to supplement A LOT. Hence the need to contact professors, see
The honors program page claims there’s an Honors Biology section although I can’t find it on the list of courses offered next Fall and this Spring. Ask about it and how it’s different from the regular general biology class. Ask if there’s an Honors Chemistry class, too.  Ask if there’s an honors section for COL101 (First year seminar) and COL 125 (Career exploration).
What AP’s do they give you credit for?

143.<<<MYOS1634>>>
They don’t seem to offer biostatistics. I did find a class called Statistics 118, Intro to Statistics, which is waived if you scored a 3 in AP Stats. Overall they’re not very demanding with math for various majors (even Finance majors aren’t required to take calculus 1 nor statistics). This Fall, there are 7 sections of Elementary Algebra, 12 sections of intermediate algebra/geometry, 8 sections of precalculus, 3 sections of intro to statistics, 2 sections of calculus 1 (20 students each), one section of calculus 2 (20 max), and 4 other classes.
Ask how many credits you’d be allowed to take, ie., if you could take 18.

144.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 Marist is still in consideration, although I’m not sure how much financial aid I’ll get, I would prefer to go to Dickinson over Marist. Cabrini will give me AP credit for Spanish and Italian (12 credits total / 6 each). And I’ll make sure to follow up and ask about all their honors science programs/ research opportunities available.
@kidzncatz I’ll make sure to call sometime this week to ask those key questions. I have been rethinking commuting to college everyday, especially in the winter here it can be pretty rough.
@Creekland Makes sense, knowing how those before me faired at going to med school (if at all), would pretty much be one of the key indicators if Cabrini is really right for me or not.

145.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Have you sent a letter of foninued interest to Dickinson expressed interest in their Italian major and study abroad as well as science, and indicated they’re you’re #1 choice so you would gladly attend if they admitted you?

146.<<<Elly710>>>
@MYOS1634 I did, I sent the letter to the Admissions Committee, about 2 weeks ago, I didn’t discuss the study abroad, only because my personal essay/statement was about being hispanic, loving languages, and my wish to study abroad in the future. I talked about my 4 week internship at Bryn Mawr Hospital beginning in early May, and how the exposure will help my future chosen major.
I’m not sure there is much else I can do, I did clearly express that if accepted, i would enroll without hesitation!

147.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Excellent. Just checking you did send it! 
Marist is better than WCU or Cabrini, less good than Dickinson. Call and say you’ve been admitted but haven’t received your financial aid package yet. You never know.

148.<<<Elly710>>>
I’m planning on sending in my deposit to West Chester University by the end of the week.
I’ve given it some thought and did some research, and I am considering switching from a Biology major to and English major on a pre-med track. With med school being my dream end result, I’ve gotten real with myself & I know I would excel far better, in English courses. All throughout high school, my grades in World Lit, American Lit, Language Composition, and Comparative Literature have always been a 90-95+. I love writing essays and reading, and would love to expand on my skills. I think with added EC’s this could really be beneficial for me?! Thoughts?

149.<<<MYOS1634>>>
Absolutely. If you’re good at it and like it, it’s a great idea. ((And, contrary to popular wisdom, pretty employable certainly more so than biology).
However make sure WCU will allow you to take the science classes you need.
(Did you get into the honors college there? Ever hear back from Marist?)

150.<<<Elly710>>>
Good to know, definitely puts me at ease! I didn’t get into the honors college at WCU though, there are only 40 spots available, and all were offered with your acceptance letter. I’ll call before placing my deposit and ask about switching majors, and the science courses I can take.
I was thinking of minoring in Spanish or Italian Language, as I absolutely love foreign language. But my concern is that it might to much on my plate…luckily I still have time to make a decision. I’ve decided to commute the first year, and then decide if living there will be easier instead, for my sophomore year.
I decided to withdraw from Marist, because I don’t think I’d get much financial aid. I also don’t love it as much as I do Dickinson. I’m still praying for Dickinson, but am well aware that my chances are slim to none.
